    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is part of series of &lt;/em&gt;Nautilus&lt;em&gt; interviews with artists, you can read the rest &lt;a aria-label=&quot;here (opens in a new tab)&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot; href=&quot;https://nautil.us/art-science/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artist Katherine Streeter works with what she’s got—literally. The New York City collagist uses found objects like dolls, magazine clippings, and old advertisements to build layered narratives into her work. The results are uncanny: repurposed faces atop impossible bodies enjoying new life on her canvases. Streeter’s work has been showcased in &lt;em&gt;Harper’s&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt;, and she recently sat down to answer our questions about her creative process, why she prefers found objects, and what scientists can learn from artists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you decide pursuing art was the path you wanted to take?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always knew my path was art. It’s been one of the few things in my life that I never doubted for a second. As far back as my memory goes, I loved telling visual stories and creating narratives. Before I understood what being a professional artist meant, I was drawing and collaging in notebooks. As a teenager, inspiration came from the underground culture around me in the new media—the MTV of the 1980s, and art galleries, as well as from an obsession with magazines. Once I had to define a career path, art school gave me a bigger understanding of it, and I was very excited to work hard to find my voice, and to figure out where I might fit into it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;2560&quot; height=&quot;2560&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/streeter_2-scaled.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1191403&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;“Witchy Moon” – “This was inspired by the beauty of Nature and the forces of the full moon.”&lt;em&gt; Image courtesy of Katherine Streeter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you walk us through your creative process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My process is a lot like the concept of collage itself, it’s something pieced together from a lot of different bits. There are scraps and notes and sketches. I keep cut-out faces and shape clippings from various printed materials. I have two different approaches depending on the project: If it’s a commercial assignment or a commission, I start with the topic or content, and I plan the art around it. If I’m working on personal work, I often don’t have a defined starting point. I tend to experiment more and allow it to be a stream of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

What about that story captured your imagination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was very moving, and I loved the way Summer Praetorius wrote it. The experiences of her brother juxtaposed to the Earth’s history unfolded in a way that allowed for empathy and understanding. The realization that there are consequences in science and nature seems obvious, but we are often too close to really see it objectively. I was inspired to focus on the fact that the Earth has layered experiences, just like humans do. One event can have a ripple effect on multiple levels, and every occurrence informs the next; every piece of the story has meaning; a cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story felt perfect for a collage. The metaphorical layers showing themselves in time made me think of pasted posters on city buildings. I thought of the texture of it all; the peeling edges revealing the faded details. The weather damage taking its toll, and yet, in life, we mostly take it for granted and assume that the destruction will be covered up with newness.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything you think scientists can learn from artists—or vice versa?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both science and art make sense of abstract concepts, and nature is constantly adapting to change in mysterious ways. I think that science can borrow intuition from artists because highly creative people embrace mystery with ease. On the other hand, science can inspire artists to pay attention to patterns in nature. This is an important aspect of creation; repetition can inform their artistic approach and understanding of their own work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;2000&quot; height=&quot;1500&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/studio3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1191400&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;“My obsession with hands and dolls sparked a curious collection of objects like this old mannequin part.

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love photography, and as much as I love taking photos, I rarely use my own for my collages. I am attracted to the printed pieces of history, and inspired to use faces that evoke a dreamy nostalgic quality. Repurposing elements from our human timeline feels like building layers for a new narrative, which is similar to the concept of layering an underpainting on a canvas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you’re looking for potential items to use in your art, what sparks your interest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love the colors of old inks on old papers, and the textures of old book pages. The imperfections in printing inspire my work. Sometimes starting with something that is destroyed can release the pressure to keep it nice, or be perfect. Flea markets and thrift shops are places where I sometimes look for my materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;2560&quot; height=&quot;2560&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/streeter_1-scaled.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1191401&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;“Spring” – “This is a quiet homage to the simple pleasure of green growth in springtime.” &lt;em&gt;Image courtesy of Katherine Streeter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you approach personal art versus commercial projects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My personal art is constantly shaping itself because it comes from everyday experiences. Thought patterns form into concepts, and witnessing moments during the day can occupy creative mental space to grow from. I’m sure we all do that; as creative people, we see the world around us as spark plugs that can ignite an idea to launch from. My commercial art is a different mindset than this, although I still adhere to dreamy methods when working with clients. My favorite commissioned projects start with just a few words or one broad idea because sometimes less is more for me. I like to cast a wide net from there and invent concepts that are both abstract and literal. I’m equally challenged by projects that are based on a lot of information upfront as well. It’s a good exercise to start with a big pile of hay to find a needle in. For me, commercial work has always been a great balance of art-making and problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you decide when a personal project is finished?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m probably echoing most artists by saying that it is mostly just a feeling. I tend to be a perfectionist, which surprises people because my work is nothing like what one thinks of in that regard. There are no life-like elements outside of my collage pieces. I don’t focus on rendering, perspectives, or color theory in the same ways we were taught in art school. My process is mostly intuitive and guided by impulses, even in the sketch phase. The concept of completion varies from piece to piece. To call something finished is to feel that I cannot do any more to it, or make it any better. I have learned that sometimes not trusting my gut on this will lead to overthinking and overworking it, which can lessen its power.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m also looking forward to challenging myself in some new ways, like working on a larger scale, and building on existing series of works. Getting out of my comfort zone is important and a necessary reminder that I’m constantly learning, and if I keep doing only what has worked in the past, I will risk stagnation. I often think of Newton’s First Law of Motion in this way; that if I stay in motion I will remain in motion. I aim to embrace this inside of the studio as well as in life!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interview by Jake Currie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They tell ancient stories about the Earth and its climate, marking wet years, dry years, and periods of growth. Artist Tiffany Shlain and her husband, roboticist Ken Goldberg, decided they would make a perfect canvas for a set of artworks that explore the ways art and science are embedded in nature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together, they collected giant cross-sections of already harvested trees from salvage yards and used them to create a series of tree-ring sculptures, carving inscriptions in the wood: notes about the human quest for knowledge and historical timelines going back thousands of years. These sculptures are featured in a show they put together for the Getty Museum’s Art and Science Collide program titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skirball.org/about/press/2024/skirball-cultural-center-presents-ancient-wisdom-future-ecology-trees-time&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ancient Wisdom for a Future Ecology: Trees, Time, and Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The timeline takes the shape of a golden spiral, a mathematical relationship found often in natural structures such as the nautilus shell, and associated with great beauty. The properties of the golden spiral, and the golden ratio upon which it is built, have been debated by some of the greatest mathematical minds of all ages, from Pythagoras and Euclid in ancient Greece to present-day scientific figures such as Oxford &lt;a href=&quot;https://nautil.us/when-work-is-play-1163461&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;physicist Roger Penrose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shlain and Goldberg say they wanted to bring to life the idea that both art and math are abstractions—ways of describing the natural world without language. “These symbols can say so much so concisely without any words,” Goldberg says. “So they are like art in that they convey meaning in a visual form. It’s a language, but it’s a different language than text.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

They were studying the piece—the biggest they had collected—when they noticed something. “It had these sharp edges, which none of the other tree rings in the show have,” says Shlain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the artists, the tree’s rough angles—created in the salvage process—seemed to echo the basic foundations of math. They started thinking about geometry and the math of straight lines. More than 2,000 years ago, the Greek mathematician Euclid observed the most basic relationships of shapes, lines, and figures in two dimensions. “The shape of the tree ring that came from the salvaged wood informed our thinking around the piece,” Shlain says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The artists left space to add more dates to the timelines at the outer edges of the tree rings, a gesture towards our uncertain future. “These trees live in a deep past that we don’t know,” says Shlain, “and they will be alive in a deep future.”&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is on display through March 2 at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles, and will then move onto the San Francisco Bay Area’s di Rosa Center for Contemporary Art.&amp;nbsp; &lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13765&quot; style=&quot;width: 14px;&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately for Santiago Monroy García, the picture was taken with an elaborate system of camera traps that allowed him to observe and photograph the bear from a distance, and without significant disturbance to its natural habitat. Monroy García, whose image won the “Animals” category of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cupoty.com/winners-6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Close Up Photographer of the Year&lt;/a&gt; competition, noted that the frigid temperatures, dense foliage, and humidity of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ecopalaciochingaza.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Ecopalacio Nature Reserve&lt;/a&gt; actually helped generate this shot: A few raindrops on the camera lens created subtle textures and blurs that rendered the bear in sharp focus, giving its surroundings a dreamlike, haunted appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monroy García made several failed attempts before capturing this shot. Intensely shy and solitary by nature, Andean bears are the only known ursids native to South America and are dwindling in numbers, largely due to habitat fragmentation, agriculture, and poaching. Though relatively little is known about the bears, recent photography-based research efforts have shed light on previously undocumented behaviors. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.70304&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; published late last year, researchers used collared cameras to trace Andean bears’ activities, providing a unique “bear’s-eye-view” of the mammal’s environment. Scientists recorded novel insights about their feeding preferences, canopy-based mating practices, and a rare instance of infanticide and cannibalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that fewer than 18,000 Andean bears remain in South America, these mammals have managed to capture the imagination of cultures worldwide. This species, called &lt;em&gt;ukuku&lt;/em&gt; in the Quechua language, has historically held spiritual and cultural significance for Andean peoples. And in England, the beloved Paddington Bear is, himself, an Andean bear who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/surprising-dearth-spectacled-bears&quot;&gt;claimed to have emerged&lt;/a&gt; from the dark forests of Peru—much like Nariz de Calavera, pictured here.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dash has spent decades educating others about biology, natural history, and ecology as a secondary school teacher and naturalist. These are the subjects that have also caught his photographer’s eye over the years. His first book, &lt;em&gt;On An Acre Shy of Eternity: Micro Landscapes at the Edge&lt;/em&gt;, was a three-year photographic study of a small pocket of land on one of the San Juan Islands, off the coast of Washington, where Dash lives. In &lt;em&gt;Food Planet Future&lt;/em&gt;, he set his sights on agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agriculture is one of the most destructive activities ever practiced by humans on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a scanning electron microscope, Dash captures the intricacies of tiny seeds, spores, and scales at the micro level, revealing unexpected shapes and patterns. With a digital camera, he photographs recognizable features of popular foods, ones familiar to the naked eye. Dash then creates mashups of his creations, uncanny compilations that juxtapose distinct levels of scale. Each image is paired with a story that narrates the relationship it has to our tangled global crises of food security, climate change, and biodiversity loss, and to the regenerative strategies that could help pull us back from the brink.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently spoke with Dash about the poetry in scientific facts, the artistic appeal of montage, and the role agriculture could play in conservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made you want to create &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Food Planet Future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have absolutely been fascinated by the art of plants over time, and the spectacular service that they provide for us by making life possible. My first book was about all the layers of beauty I could find in one small plot of land, three quarters of an acre, where we live. I found access to a scanning electron microscope and was looking at seeds, feathers, and pollen, among other things. While attending portfolio reviews, someone suggested that I look at food using the same scanning electron microscope approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/f3yVqR1g-Neith_BREAKER.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1186953&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CORN:&lt;/strong&gt; This montage blends the familiar (color photographs) with the hidden (black and white photos and scanning electron micrographs). The seeds orbiting the corn are crop wild relative kernels of corn—the original seeds to which all of today’s varieties are related. Genes from these wild plants may help crops become more resilient to heat, drought, and disease.

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began looking for patterns and textures in food that would make my jaw drop. The second part was: Did that food have a climate story? The climate story was often that things are falling apart. But, as I looked further, I saw stories that were positive and regenerative, stories that were helping heal the climate issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you choose the subjects for this book?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of friends who grow food, and some of them are very experimental, like growing rice in the northwest and in the San Juan Islands. Many of them provided sample foods. Also, I would come upon something common in the store and just ask the question, “What is the climate story of this food?” When there was a very clear climate story—especially one with a tie to rebuilding soil, reducing food waste, or helping capture carbon—and it had a beautiful texture or pattern to it, I chose those to look more closely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a favorite image from the book?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really like the quinoa image. When I first saw the inside of a quinoa seed with the microscope, I was absolutely stunned by the starch granules, which look almost like soccer balls. And then the leaf itself has these phenomenal trichome structures that are so gorgeous and surprising, and you’d never know about them if you didn’t look closely. The backstory of that one is that a researcher came from Rwanda. As a child he had been in refugee camps where he nearly starved. He came and got his Ph.D. at the research station in Washington state where I took that quinoa image. He brought that quinoa back to Rwanda and introduced it to farmers all over East Africa. Things like that are mind blowing. Not just the absolute beauty of what we’re looking at, but also the human consequences of studying and sharing that kind of resource.&lt;/p&gt;

I have grounded my photography over decades in wilderness and nature, with a great interest in conservation and preservation. If anybody’s interested in conservation and preservation, they must be interested in agriculture. It is in our lives, all day, every day. We all think about food constantly, but we don’t necessarily think about how it’s being grown and how that is impacting the rest of our lives, through drought, fires, floods. The themes were so big and so fascinating, it just felt like an incredible place to explore artistically, scientifically, and environmentally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you become interested in photography?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started decades ago as a kid with a camera. There’s a magic in being able to see something reflected in our vision, a product that surprises us and excites us or teaches us something new. It’s almost like going fishing. When you go out with a camera, you wonder what you’re going to catch. Are you going to find a moment of light, of wonder, of surprise? So much of photographing nature is that there are things you can see with a camera or a particular lens that you can’t see with the naked eye. I often go back and enlarge something and study it and find shapes or colors or structures that I had no idea were there. Besides just pure inspiration, it can also lead to further study and awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/fZPoPoOP-Neith_BREAKER-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1186956&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRICKET AND PEA PROTEIN:&lt;/strong&gt; Many Western countries are pursuing alternative forms of dietary protein for humans, pets, and livestock, including insects such as crickets, mealworms, and black soldier fly larvae—as well as plants such as peas and beans. Insect protein can be produced using a small fraction of the land, water, and energy used for animal protein; and it generates a small fraction of the methane. Substituting insect protein for fish protein in pet food and fishmeal can also help reduce pressure on ocean fish populations. MACRO: Garden pea, Pisum sativum; flower.

What appeals to you about montage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m really fascinated by the idea of a conversation between macro and micro, black and white and color, fact and metaphor, humor and seriousness. It’s a challenge to have these elements work together, to create balance, where the elements talk to each other in a way that doesn’t feel contrived. To create these montages that have all these different layers, it echoes the theme itself that has so many layers. You’re looking at something that you haven’t seen before, and with these combinations that are imaginary but also hyper real.&lt;/p&gt;

Scientific facts to me, are poetic. You think about a seed becoming a 300-foot redwood and then the redwood turning back into soil. Those are facts but imagine the mystery and the miracle that those things can happen. I’ve often felt the more I learn scientific facts, the more fascination, curiosity, and wonder there is. As an educator, when we’re excited about something and dedicated to something, it becomes imperative to express it and communicate it in some way. And art can be a wonderful way to do that. &lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13765&quot; style=&quot;width: 14px;&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Images from &lt;/em&gt;Food Planet Future&lt;em&gt; will be on display at the Bioneers Conference 2025, March 27-29, in Berkeley, California.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is part of series of &lt;/em&gt;Nautilus&lt;em&gt; interviews with artists, you can read the rest &lt;a aria-label=&quot;here (opens in a new tab)&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot; href=&quot;https://nautil.us/art-science/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Browsing through Myriam Wares’ art is like wandering through a dream. Familiar objects loom over alien landscapes, faceless figures navigate impossible architecture, and the boundaries of the natural and supernatural blur. For Ware, whose illustrations have appeared in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt;, creating these magical realms involves careful planning. Unlike how we reconstruct dreams after waking—stitching together fleeting details and residues of emotion—Ware thoughtfully curates symbols to convey feelings and ideas. She recently sat down to answer our questions about her creative process, the difference between digital and analog painting, and the future of art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What drew you to the arts in the first place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think I’ve always been an illustrator at heart. If I look back, I started drawing before I even spoke my first word. As a child, I spent a lot of time copying illustrations from my picture books. My father had an M.C. Escher book lying around the house; I remember being so fascinated by the artist’s impossible universe. It was my dream to one day be able to create my own world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming out of high school, I had no idea what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, so I signed up for a fine arts program, then later switched to commercial illustration. I wasn’t thinking so far ahead back then, I just continued doing what I did best. Things eventually fell into place, and I started freelancing full time soon after graduating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;1667&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Myriamwares_sample-2_2025.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1183008&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;The Verge: The walls of Apple’s garden are tumbling down. &lt;em&gt;Image courtesy of Myriam Wares&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you walk us through your process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;My process is always on and running in the back of my mind. Despite having a style that leans more towards surrealism, much of my inspiration comes directly from the observable world. I make it a point to take some time away from my computer and spend some time outdoors. I’m always accumulating a bank of visual images in my mind for future use, which I refer to when the time comes to sit down and do the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More concretely, I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://ca.pinterest.com/myrillustration/_saved/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;dozens of Pinterest boards&lt;/a&gt; full of reference photos of plants, fruits, architecture, classical artworks, and so on. This has become my own personal library of symbolism. Creating an illustration, in a way, is translating an idea or feeling into an image. When given an assignment, the first step consists of pinpointing what needs to be communicated, then figuring out how to say it using symbols rather than words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you work through a creative block?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find getting to work regardless gets me out of it. I start drawing without giving too much thought about whether what I’m doing will be good or not. I find action naturally leads me out of any block or anxiety I might have about a given piece. Having a routine also helps. If I get into the habit of producing work during the same period of time every day, inspiration flows more naturally. If instead I wait for inspiration to strike before getting to work, I’ll be waiting for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of your work features surreal elements, how would you describe your aesthetic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hear my work referred to as surrealism a lot—and use the label myself sometimes. I definitely take some inspiration from surrealist painters, notably Magritte. I love how he twists familiar objects in unexpected ways, offering us new ways to look at reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some other surrealist painters used a more spontaneous “automatic” approach to painting, which I don’t relate to as much. I’m rather intentional about the elements I include in my work and ponder their meaning a lot. Perhaps the label “magical realism,” or just “symbolism,” would be better suited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;1875&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Myriamwares_sample-1_2025.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1183009&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image courtesy of Myriam Wares&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not long ago you started painting again after working exclusively in digital. What was that like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refreshing. I love working digitally, but I find myself longing for a time before technology became so present in our lives, when you could just sit with a painting for a while. After a few years of constantly producing work under tight deadlines, it’s easy to get the feeling of mass-producing one’s own work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Painting has a grounding effect on me, similar to meditation. Everything takes twice as long to do and mistakes aren’t so easily erasable, so every move needs to be carefully considered. I try to carve some time out of my hectic schedule to paint a bit every month. Little by little, between client commissions, I’d like to build up a collection of paintings and see where that leads me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You created the cover for &lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt; Issue 32, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://nautil.us/dawn-of-the-heliocene-237963/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Dawn of the Heliocene&lt;/a&gt;,” about how the next geological epoch should be named for humans’ harnessing of solar energy. What about that story captured your imagination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember being mesmerized by Summer Praetorius’ beautifully written and deeply personal piece, which centers around the sun and our use of its energy. She makes a case for why we should name the new geological epoch Heliocene, rather than the more somber Anthropocene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sun is the protagonist of the story, which inspired me to place it at the center of the composition. I wanted to represent it as both a healing force and a potentially destructive one. We can choose to move forward using the sun’s energy in a harmful way via fossil fuels, which the author refers to as “trapped sunlight,” or in a new and cleaner way via solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plant that grows amongst the rubble is symbolic of life’s persistence through past cataclysmic disasters. Illustrating it person-shaped conveys that humans can be adaptable in much the same way in the face of future challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;2389&quot; height=&quot;2560&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/MyriamWares-cover-Dawn-of-the-Heliocene-scaled.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1183010&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 2389px) 100vw, 2389px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;Nautilus: Issue 32 cover. &lt;em&gt;By Myriam Wares&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything you think scientists can learn from artists—or vice versa?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve often heard that the best scientists, like artists, are creative souls. On the other hand, I think great artists are investigative about the world that surrounds them, as are scientists. Both certainly have an inexhaustible curiosity for the world and seek to understand it more deeply. Perhaps we are more alike than conventional wisdom would presume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over the past 10 years or so there have been a lot of technological changes in how art is created and disseminated—the rise of generative AI, the proliferation of social media, more advanced digital tools, and so on. As an art history enthusiast, what do you think the future holds for art and artists?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a complex and polarizing question, which no one can answer with certainty. Personally, I’m not worried that AI will ever replace artists. That said, it will likely have a certain impact on the creative world.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, I’m now seeing some people approach me with AI-generated briefs to illustrate in my own style. I’m not quite sure what to make of this new occurrence, but I personally do not see much value in including AI in my process, considering doing such a thing was unheard of just one year ago. This removes the artist from parts of their process, which usually impacts the final piece for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think anyone alive has had the experience of being profoundly moved by a work of art—and knows quite intuitively that machines fall flat in that regard. The creative process is a deeply personal one that should involve the artist from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My real fear is not that computers will replace art, but rather that the perceived value of creative work might diminish, considering the production cost of AI-generated visuals is extremely low. Unfortunately, we cannot control the spread and use of new technologies. What we can do is focus our creative efforts on what makes us better than computers. I wouldn’t worry too much about the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;2175&quot; height=&quot;2175&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Myriamwares_sample-5_2025.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1183011&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 2175px) 100vw, 2175px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image courtesy of Myriam Wares&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is part of series of &lt;/em&gt;Nautilus&lt;em&gt; interviews with artists, you can read the rest &lt;a aria-label=&quot;here (opens in a new tab)&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot; href=&quot;https://nautil.us/art-science/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Award-winning illustrator Deena So’Oteh is a master of shadow and light. Her work, which has appeared in the pages of &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt;, often features luminous figures emerging from a foreboding darkness. In many ways, she says, the struggle between the two mirrors her own artistic journey. So’Oteh recently sat down to answer our questions about her journey to art, how she resolves creative blocks, and what scientists can learn from artists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you decide pursuing art was the path you wanted to take?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;My story might not be the typical one—I wasn’t the kid who always drew to escape into an imaginary world. In a way, the decision to pursue art was made for me, and once it was, there wasn’t much room for imagining other paths. My mom recognized an artistic inclination in me from an early age, so she made it a priority to nurture it. For much of my life, I assumed I would become a fine artist without ever questioning it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My conscious decision to pursue art as a career came much later, and it was a more practical, grounded choice. My family immigrated to the United States when I was 12, and things took a rough turn. My parents went through a difficult divorce, and my father took away all our legal documents. By 18, instead of attending Parsons on a full scholarship, I found myself waitressing for the next eight years, thinking my only career path might be as a professional waitress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my legal status finally changed, I chose to pursue what I knew best—art—but not fine art as I had originally imagined. After eight years of uncertainty as an undocumented immigrant, I was seeking stability while doing something I loved. Illustration felt like a more practical use of my skills and a reliable way to make a living (little did I know!). I went on to earn a BFA in Illustration, but it wasn’t until my time at the School of Visual Arts for my master’s program that I realized my seemingly pragmatic decision was actually driven by something deeper and more intuitive. Illustration turned out to be the perfect fit for me. It combined everything I loved—reading, storytelling, learning, problem-solving, and creating—and opened doors to growth I hadn’t expected. It felt like I was finally on the path that was truly mine, and in a way, one that would make my mom even more proud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;1429&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/processed_2023-05-04DeenaSoOtehDoctorspostRoeDupdate272dpi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1171316&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;The New Yorker: Doctors post-Roe. &lt;em&gt;Image courtesy of Deena So’Oteh. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you walk us through your creative process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless I have an immediate response to a brief or a tight deadline, my process usually begins with a walk or another unrelated activity. From what I’ve learned from countless interviews with neuroscientists (which I often listen to while working), most of our neurons are wired for movement and I’ve found that moving around helps me process and rethink the material, giving me a fresh perspective—and it clears my head, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I have the luxury of time (which, given the rise of AI, is becoming more rare), I let a day pass before revisiting the brief in the evening, highlighting words or phrases that spark visual ideas. To avoid distractions, I usually start sketching early—sometimes as early as 4 or 5 a.m. That quiet time, before the world wakes up, is when I feel most creative and free from the distractions of the day. I believe there’s a specific time that works best for each part of the creative process, and once you recognize it, the results can be much more productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tend to think in color right away because it helps set the tone for the piece. I also make my sketches as large as the final artwork, as I’ve found that the serendipity of the sketch process often leads to discoveries I might want to keep in the final piece. Once the concept is approved, I give myself space to experiment with different brushes, textures, and techniques. This element of play and discovery is key to my creative process, as it keeps things exciting and fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you work through a creative block?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I hit a creative block, I often switch to another project that’s at a different stage or one where I feel a sense of ease. This helps relieve the pressure and creates the space I need to process the material. I believe creative blocks stem from not being in the right mental space, so my first priority is to reset. Sometimes, it’s personal life creeping in, and I have to acknowledge it and use it to fuel the creative process. Other times, it’s the stress of not knowing a topic well enough or worrying about how my work will be received. In those moments, I try to let go of my ego and imagined judgments, allowing the ideas to flow without the fear of failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;1538&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/2024-11-10DeenaSoOtehWIREDSurvailanceupdateb72dpi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1171318&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 1538px) 100vw, 1538px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;WIRED: The WIRED Guide to Protecting Yourself From Government Surveillance. &lt;em&gt;Image courtesy of Deena So’Oteh. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of your work features bright lights and dark shadows.

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artist Marshall Arisman always said, “Draw what you know.” It took me a while to understand what that meant for me personally, but over time it became clear: I know the internal struggle between light and dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been through some very dark periods in my life, and without my deep belief that there’s beauty beyond the struggles, my path might have been very different—and likely much shorter. Light and dark, in that sense, aren’t just visual contrasts; they represent the forces that shape our emotional and psychological journeys. They are always present, and we’re constantly trying to balance them within ourselves and in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, it’s not that I’m particularly drawn to the aesthetic of light and shadow—rather, it’s more about the need to express what’s happening internally. This is how I process and understand my experiences. It’s a way to navigate and make sense of the complexities of life, using visual elements to reflect those ongoing, internal dialogues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You created the art for the cover story of &lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt; Issue 48, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://nautil.us/what-plants-are-saying-about-us-264593/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;What Plants Are Saying About Us&lt;/a&gt;,” about the possibility of plant cognition. What about that story captured your imagination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m totally fascinated by the natural world, cognition, and neuroscience. If I weren’t an artist, I think I’d be a scientist. I’ve always felt plants have a kind of intelligence, just not the kind we recognize. You can see it in how they adapt and respond, even if you keep their environment constant. This project was a chance to express that love for plants visually—a rare opportunity for me with this subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;2389&quot; height=&quot;2560&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/48-DeenaSoOteh-1-scaled.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1171319&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 2389px) 100vw, 2389px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;Nautilus: Issue 48 cover. &lt;em&gt;By Deena So’Oteh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything you think scientists can learn from artists—or vice versa?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe, in essence, we are the same. Scientists are artists, and artists are scientists. Both fields require creative thinking to discover or perceive something new, as well as a deep understanding of materials and techniques. Whether it’s experimenting with new ideas or refining existing ones, both require a willingness to explore until that “Aha!” moment occurs. The divide between the two fields is much smaller than we often imagine. Sharing our approaches to thinking, analyzing, and processing information would benefit both scientists and artists, fostering greater collaboration and innovation across disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You recently illustrated your first children’s book, &lt;em&gt;Narwhal, Unicorn of the Arctic&lt;/em&gt;. Did you approach that differently than your other illustration work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With nonfiction, research is the first step in the creative process. I had to fully immerse myself in the world of narwhals before mapping out the book’s flow and beginning the sketches. It required a unique focus—honoring the natural world while making it accessible and engaging for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a book also demands a different kind of stamina. I’m more of a sprinter by nature, and a book project is a marathon. That was a big learning curve for me. In editorial work, things move quickly; you’re a coiled spring, committing immediately to a composition, color palette, approach. A book, however, allows more time for experimentation, but also invites more self-doubt. There’s also the weight of knowing the book will live on someone’s shelf for years, adding both pressure and meaning to the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;1972&quot; height=&quot;1200&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/deena-so-oteh-nautilus-interview-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1171320&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 1972px) 100vw, 1972px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;Narwhal: Unicorn of the Arctic, Penguin Random House 2024; The Guardian Weekly: The golden/nightmare AI future. &lt;em&gt;Images courtesy of Deena So’Oteh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You created the cover art for an issue of &lt;em&gt;The Guardian Weekly&lt;/em&gt; about the AI debate. What are your thoughts on the use of AI to create art?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI is a complex and loaded topic, especially in the creative field. While some argue that AI is “just a tool,” it erases the years of personal effort, trial and error, and soul-searching that go into art. It risks devaluing the creative process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve adapted to tools like Photoshop, but AI feels different. It suggests that the years spent developing a unique artistic voice and honing one’s craft are no longer valuable, since anyone can now input a prompt and generate a similar result. While some argue that prompting AI itself is a form of art, I’d rather invest my time in learning to ask myself the right questions to create better and live a happier life than spend time teaching a machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the images AI generates shape our collective perceptions and influence how the next generation views art. Personally, I’d much prefer AI take over my laundry and house chores than solve my creative challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you see any role for AI in your work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not within my artistic practice. If anything, AI makes me want to step away from digital work entirely and lean back into traditional methods, where the authenticity feels more tangible. Some people use AI as a reference and then recreate the image by hand, but for me, the whole point is in the process itself—the thinking, experimenting, and reflecting that goes into each piece. My work is craft, and it brings meaning to my life, defining my purpose and even my happiness. I want to apply it with respect and care, not rush or automate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Art, for me, is a kind of therapy. It’s a way to learn about myself, and that’s something I’m not interested in handing over to AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interview by Jake Currie. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He felt certain that somewhere among the shrubs of his home village in Mexico or in the surrounding jungle grew the wild &lt;em&gt;ch’oj&lt;/em&gt;. He needed the plant to extract indigo, a dye he could experiment with to unlock the recipe of “Mayan blue”—a pigment no longer available in the markets of the Yucatan peninsula, and a favorite color of the Mayan gods.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“There are five cardinal points in the Mayan cosmogony,” says May Ku, who is a ceramics artist and identifies as Mayan. In addition to north, south, east, and west, there is the cardinal point that stands for the center of the Earth. “Its color is a mixture of blue and green,” May Ku says. “It holds the world together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A native of Dzán, a tiny village nestled in Yucatan, May Ku splits his time between home and Cobá, a renowned hub of classical Mayan culture, where a collection of pyramids—estimated to be some 1,100 to 1,500 years old—attracts tourists and scholars in search of the past. At Cobá, May Ku is the director of the local cultural center and a public school teacher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The secret was in the local clay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I started making faces of Mayan people who are currently living, who are in Mayan communities,” says May Ku. Practicing the&lt;a href=&quot;https://arth.sas.upenn.edu/content/mexican-costumbrismo-race-society-and-identity-nineteenth-century-art#:~:text=In%20contrast%20to%20the%20neoclassical,food%2C%20dwellings%2C%20and%20occupations.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt; &lt;em&gt;costumbrismo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; syle of art that focuses on the everyday, May Ku wanted to use the same colors as his ancestors. White and red were available from the local stores, but he coveted blue, in that sacred hue that “purifies, and heals,” he says. A millennium ago, it was used by Mayans to decorate objects as well as to cover the skin of people and animals during rituals. But all the blues that May Ku could purchase were synthetic. “I didn’t like it,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After years of scouring for clues far and near—the internet and his local environment—May Ku found a single &lt;em&gt;ch’oj &lt;/em&gt;plant (&lt;em&gt;Indigofera suffruticosa&lt;/em&gt;) in the backyard of the very cultural center where he worked. He confirmed with a botanist friend that this was the plant he was looking for. Deciding between cutting the plant down to experiment immediately and setting up a small grove, May Ku settled for the patient option. It took him a few months to collect the seeds, plant them, and nurture them before attempting to extract the indigo dye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Friends in Cobá lent me a piece of land” May Ku says, “and we took care of [of the seedlings] with a group of families. I told them that you have to put a lot of water on it, you have to water it, it has to be in the sun.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then he harvested leaves and soaked them in water for a full day; the leaves began to ferment. He shook this broth to aerate it, and the dye precipitated. If you were to soak clothes in the fermented water, they would first bleach and then begin to turn it blue, he explains. “This practice was used by the ancient Mayans,” May Ku says, “to paint their clothes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/tX1AMcFJ-Kazamia_BREAKER.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1169719&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A SACRED HUE: &lt;/strong&gt;Mayan blue was used in ancient societies to decorate objects and color images, and to purify the skin of people and animals in rituals. It was considered the color of the gods. Luis May Ku now uses it to decorate ceramic sculptures crafted in a traditional style, like the one shown here. &lt;em&gt;Photo courtesy of Luis May&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But “Mayan blue is not just the plant,” May Ku says. The indigo dye is soluble and washes away quickly. To produce Mayan blue, it has to be heated together with special clay. “It is a local soil that combines with the plant, the molecular elements of the two tie up.”&lt;/p&gt;

Studies had determined that ink extracted from variants of &lt;em&gt;Indigofera suffruticosa &lt;/em&gt;was likely mixed with either sepiolite or palygorskite clays in various combinations to produce a range of blue pigments used by Mayans, Aztecs, and other Mesoamerican tribes. Today it survives as color on parchment and sculptures from that period, having withstood the wear of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have attempted to reconstruct the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gary-Feinman/publication/230760693_The_first_direct_evidence_for_the_production_of_Maya_Blue_Rediscovery_of_a_technology/links/0fcfd503ffcc1c5bfe000000/The-first-direct-evidence-for-the-production-of-Maya-Blue-Rediscovery-of-a-technology.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt; traditional Mayan process of preparing the pigment&lt;/a&gt; because it is so durable, resistant to age, acid, weathering, biodegradation and even modern chemical solvents. The description of this process is absent from surviving pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican codices. These are records containing images and text, dating to 1250-1521 that are considered the scholarly legacy of Indigenous history, religion, and astronomy of the region before colonial contact. But the chemical composition is meticulously documented through&lt;a href=&quot;https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jrs.1751&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt; spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt; and other techniques, using synthetic variants of Mayan blue and&lt;a href=&quot;https://heritagesciencejournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40494-019-0345-z&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt; original scripts&lt;/a&gt; for using to color images, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://heritagesciencejournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40494-019-0345-z/figures/6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;mythical creatures, human-like figures, flowing water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May Ku set up a makeshift lab to try to recreate the pigment at home. He fermented the &lt;em&gt;ch’oj&lt;/em&gt; and combined the ink with clay by experimenting in various ceramics techniques. The day he first saw a pigment that resembled Mayan blue, he says he was “ecstatic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mayan blue is born from a combination of trial and error,” says May Ku, and “I was able to arrive at this method … the closest to the pre-Hispanic way of how to do it.” Two separate laboratories, in Italy and in Mexico, confirmed that the chemical composition of the pigment he produced is analogous to the variety used by his Mayan ancestors, a millennium ago, says May Ku.&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks to May Ku’s efforts, after a thousand-year hiatus, a trade in Mayan blue has resumed in Yucatan. The land had kept the tradition all along. &lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13765&quot; style=&quot;width: 14px;&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lead photo courtesy of Luis May&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://nautil.us/reviving-mayan-blue-1169711/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nautil.us/reviving-mayan-blue-1169711/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2024 11:28:26 GMT</pubDate><author>Elena Kazamia</author></item><item><title>That Healing Sound</title><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/OnTslp5U-Berger_HERO.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;s a music lover my entire life, who could have been doing productive things to be a good citizen rather than playing albums and going to concerts, I can safely say I have never been inclined to think of music as having any practical value.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;But reading the new book by Daniel Levitin, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324036180&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;I Heard There Was a Secret Chord: Music as Medicine&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; made me think otherwise. Levitin, a neuroscientist who first got the public thinking about the biological machinery behind music in his 2006 book, &lt;em&gt;This Is Your Brain on Music&lt;/em&gt;, puts the spotlight on burgeoning methods of music therapy restoring pleasure to so many people who have lost it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, over video, I told Levitin at his home in Hollywood that his book opened my eyes to the seemingly magical effects of music therapy. That led us into an engaging conversation on the secret chords that music strikes in our brains and bodies. Levitin began writing the book around the time he got some news from friend Bobby McFerrin, the many-splendored vocalist best known for his a cappella hit, “Don’t Worry, Be Happy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Z5Pt2axa-Berger_BREAKER.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1165016&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE NEUROSCIENTIST’S SONG:&lt;/strong&gt; Daniel Levitin, professor emeritus at McGill University, is a musician himself: “Songwriting has also helped me to better understand my emotions about the loss of those close to me, and the breakup of relationships.” &lt;em&gt;Photo courtesy of Daniel Levitin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You write that Bobby McFerrin “changed forever the way you think about music and medicine.” How so?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin with, I consider Bobby to be among a small number of people who are oracles. They’re human 2.0 Whatever force he’s in touch with, he just seems more evolved than the rest of us. That’s not to sound mystical or anything, but when Bobby says or does something, I pay close attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day Bobby was feeling fatigued before a show in Vermont. He didn’t feel like he had the flu. He didn’t know what it was. But he was going to cancel the show. And then, because he’s Bobby and thinks more about other people than he does himself, he started imagining all these people who bought tickets. They’d probably been planning for this evening for some time. Some of them had to hire babysitters. And he didn’t want to upset that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was like the angel and devil on each shoulder telling him, “Stay in the hotel room, you’re sick.” “No, do the show.” Anyway, he went and did it, and once he started singing, everything changed. He no longer felt fatigued, he no longer felt unfocused, and he went through the whole show. Shortly after that, he was diagnosed with &lt;a href=&quot;https://nautil.us/the-bittersweet-science-462168/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did his decision to perform tell you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew from my own work in the laboratory that dopamine does different things in different parts of the brain, but one thing it does is signal pleasure. It’s also part of the motivation network. It motivates you to do things that are pleasurable or healthful, and it helps you to coordinate movement when you’re in the throes of Parkinson’s and can’t otherwise control your movements. In Bobby’s case, it kicked his motor system into doing the amazing thing he does, and the ultimate pleasure he derives from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about a few other afflictions. How does listening to music relieve depression?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “how” is a difficult question. We know it does. But we’re still trying to sort out the distinct mechanisms behind it. The social part, though, is a big factor. Usually, when you’re depressed, you don’t feel like being with other people. Something has happened in your life that has caused you to feel cut off from others. There’s an organic component of depression and there’s genetic predispositions toward it, but there’s usually some sort of environmental trigger that leaves you feeling misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you listen to happy music, that’s just another bunch of people who misunderstand how you feel. You’ve got no use for them. But, put on the right sad music, and you feel understood and validated. Your emotions are validated. It’s not somebody coming in and saying, “Hey, get up off the couch, straighten up and fly right. You have a lot to live for.” That’s not somebody who gets you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is music curing that gash on your elbow? Not directly, but it’s enabling your body to cure it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when you hear a musician or band that’s feeling what you’re feeling, you find that uplifting and validating, and you realize, “This person’s been through what I’ve been through and they came out the other side, and they turned it into a beautiful work of art.” On the chemical side, when you’re feeling in tune with the music, the hormone prolactin is released. It’s released in lactate when mothers are nursing their infants, in both the mother and the infant. It soothes and tranquilizes us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about anxiety?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a little bit different. Anxiety typically means your heart’s racing too fast. You’re worried you might have a feeling of impending doom. We’ve found populations of neurons fire in synchrony with the music, and with certain kinds of music, subject to individual taste, that can reliably lower your respiration rate and reduce cortisol levels, which are the real chemical that’s causing that anxious fight-or-flight reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a deeper note, how can listening to music help people with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nautil.us/what-alzheimers-feels-like-from-the-inside-235713/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, what we see in Alzheimer’s cases, where people have profound memory loss, is they don’t recognize where they are or how they got there. They may not recognize their loved ones. They may not even recognize themselves in the mirror. And when that happens, they do one of two things. They either fold in on themselves because the external world makes no sense, or they become violent because the external world makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latter case, they end up getting medicated, which is no good for anybody. A principle of mammalian memory is &lt;a href=&quot;https://nautil.us/your-memories-are-like-paintings-774424/?_sp=7fcb0a98-bcaa-4fd2-8f66-6a709be04a78.1732904983625&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;our earliest memories&lt;/a&gt; are the most well-preserved. If you play music for somebody with advanced memory loss, it allows them to connect with music from their youth, a part of themselves they had lost. They feel themselves again. They may still not know where they are, but at least they’re in touch with some part of themselves, and that can dramatically relieve anxiety, and in many cases, of those who reached a kind of catatonic state, it can pull them out of it for days at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have to love music for it to work in healing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, you don’t have to love it, but you have to like it. In music therapy, people often say the music piped into public places is not what they want to hear. Your doctor can’t say, “Take two Adeles and call me in the morning.” It can’t work that way. You have to like the music. You have to choose it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about the default mode network in the brain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a network of regions in the brain we describe as the daydreaming mode. If you’re a carpenter and you’re hammering, you’re really paying attention. That’s the central executive mode. Its opposite is this daydreaming mode. It’s when you’re driving on the freeway, and you miss your exit because you know your brain was somewhere else. And it’s a mode of the brain that helps you to solve problems. Often, when you can’t solve a problem by thinking about it, you put it away. That’s the part of the brain that’s working on it. It’s related to the subconscious, although not identical, and it appears to be a healing mode because it restores a kind of homeostasis to the brain and to glucose metabolism. The brain runs on glucose, like a Tesla runs on electricity, or a Buick runs on gas. Glucose is the fuel of the brain, and it gets depleted after thinking too long or too hard, and that default mode allows it to replenish.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And does music give us entry into the default mode network?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s right. Though probably not James Brown or electronic dance music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the significance of the default mode in music and healing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, here we’ve got to do some hand-waving. During sleep, for example, there’s a lot of cellular housekeeping going on, getting rid of dead cells, purifying the bloodstream, organizing the thoughts of the day and consolidating them into memories. And that’s also what happens in a waking state during the daydreaming mode. There’s something healing and restorative about it. We’re not exactly sure how. But music can take us there.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listening to or playing music allows patients to feel better. Music takes their minds off their mental or physical pains. But can music actually cure them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would say it can, in the same sense penicillin can. Penicillin doesn’t cure the disease. Penicillin kills the bacteria that was causing the disease. Surgery doesn’t cure cancer. It gets rid of the cancer. Music boosts the immune system, in particular immunoglobulin IgA, a substance that travels to the site of mucosal infections by reducing cortisol. When you’re stressed, cortisol shuts down the immune system, because cortisol usually spikes in response to an explicit proximal threat, like a lion running toward you. Over thousands of years of evolution, the cortisol system figured out that if you’re going to have to fight a lion, you’ve got to preserve all your resources to fight or to flee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your doctor can’t say, “Take two Adeles and call me in the morning.” It can’t work that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what does preserving your resources mean at a physiological and metabolic level? It means shutting down your digestive system. That can wait till later. Shutting down your libido, because you don’t have time for that now. Shutting down your immune system. That’s why people with chronic stress have compromised immune systems. And if you can reduce psychological and physical stress, you’re enabling your body’s immune system to do what it’s meant to do. Music can promote IgA levels. They can promote cytokine production, the production of natural killer cells, T cells, plus, they can increase serotonin, which boosts your mood, which in turn, can create this cascade of neurochemical activity. So, is it curing that gash on your elbow? Not directly, but it’s enabling your body to cure it.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You tell the stories in &lt;em&gt;I Heard There Was a Secret Chord&lt;/em&gt; of Joni Mitchell, who suffered a brain aneurysm, damaging a large portion of her brain’s right hemisphere; jazz pianist Keith Jarrett, who suffered two strokes leaving the left side of his body partly paralyzed; and jazz guitarist &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nautil.us/brain-damage-saved-his-music-235221/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pat Martino&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, who had a large tumor surgically removed from his brain. In each case, these great musicians were aided in their convalescence by listening to music, often their own, and in Jarrett’s case, playing the piano with his one functional hand. Although recovery from brain trauma is not an exact science, you write, music was a catalyst in their recoveries. Which makes sense because music was literally their lives. It’s so incredible they found it inside them again. But what’s an example of remarkable recovery in people who are not musicians?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, the plural of anecdote is not data, but I think of soldiers in music therapy classes that focus on songwriting. The soldiers suffer severe cases of post-traumatic stress disorder not amenable to talk therapy or drug therapy. They take all the pain and trauma and horrific visual and sensory imagery and put it out there in the world in a song; it’s no longer inside them. One of the ways talk therapy works is it allows you to not keep the trauma locked inside yourself. You’re presenting it to someone who ideally is a sympathetic, empathetic individual—the therapist—and getting it outside of you helps to make it objective, less fearful to you. Putting it in a song seems to be an even more powerful way to get the monster outside of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music can be more engaging than talk therapy—psychologically, emotionally, spiritually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a personal experience of music as medicine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, I’m thinking of my father, who I saw yesterday. He’s 92 and has short-term memory loss. He just got out of the hospital after a week with coronavirus, severe oxygen depletion, and fluid in the lungs. At home, he looked utterly transformed from the man he was in the hospital. He was listening to music from his teenage years. He was listening to Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby and Ethel Merman and Benny Goodman. I got to his house at 4 o’clock and he’d been listening for four hours straight and was just so happy. He has a blood pulse oximeter on him all the time. And when he listens to music, he breathes more deeply. The music is making him do it automatically because it’s physiologically stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about medicine for you yourself?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I can’t focus, I put music on. Sometimes I meditate to it. Sometimes I just put it on and close my eyes for 10 minutes. And when I’m feeling blue, or don’t know how I’m feeling, I can usually find the thing that helps me go, “Yeah, that’s how I feel.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you could only play one album to lift your spirits, what would it be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s an impossible question. Today it would be Alex de Grassi’s &lt;em&gt;Slow Circle&lt;/em&gt;. Or it could be Bill Evans’ &lt;em&gt;Sunday at the Village Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;. It might be Steely Dan’s &lt;em&gt;Countdown to Ecstasy&lt;/em&gt;, something I can listen to all the way through over and over again and never get tired of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My takeaway from reading &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Heard There Was a Secret Chord&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is that music has a holistic effect on our brains and bodies. And the secret of the physiological changes induced by music, which we’ve been talking about, is pleasure. Think that’s fair?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that’s exactly right. But pleasure is not one thing. Neurobiology shows pleasure is a cascade of physiological responses that absolutely help in recovery. If we were to create a taxonomy of pleasure, there would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://nautil.us/composing-your-thoughts-234367/?_sp=7fcb0a98-bcaa-4fd2-8f66-6a709be04a78.1732904895173&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;anticipatory pleasure&lt;/a&gt;, which is, “I see that cupcake and I suddenly feel good because I know I’m going to eat it.” Which is different than taking the first bite, the pleasure of consumption. Well, music is anticipation and consumption pleasure inextricably bound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultimately, what’s special about music therapy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music is special because it’s engaging. For some people, it’s more engaging than talk therapy—psychologically, emotionally, spiritually. It’s something that you can control the dose of. You can always turn it off or turn it louder or softer. And you can always choose the type of music you want to hear. &lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13765&quot; style=&quot;width: 14px;&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lead image: CURAphotography / Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://nautil.us/that-healing-sound-1165015/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nautil.us/that-healing-sound-1165015/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2024 13:31:15 GMT</pubDate><author>Kevin Berger</author></item><item><title>Color Makes the Universe</title><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/XjFwiQlB-Lambert_HERO.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; few years back, artist and self-described explorer Tyler Thrasher became obsessed with a photograph of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Naturewasmetal/comments/ox12hm/opalized_crab_claw_if_a_cavity_has_formed_because/?rdt=61055&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;opalized crab claw&lt;/a&gt; on a leather couch.

    &lt;p&gt;Thrasher began speaking with people who mine for opals and people who study photonics and learned that opals could be made synthetically—but also that those recipes are closely held secrets. So he decided to design his own. Along the way, he explored the science of everything from poisons to optical illusions to impossible colors. His new book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/727433/the-universe-in-100-colors-by-tyler-thrasher-and-terry-mudge/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Universe in 100 Colors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, co-authored with his friend and designer Terry Mudge, is a vibrant exploration of what he’s learned about color and color perception. We recently spoke about his new book, his love of color, and the power of amateur science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;542&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Lambert_BREAKER-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1160842&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REGAL:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;This is the underside of a murex sea snail.&amp;nbsp; Tens of thousands of snails were once used to produce just a couple grams of raw Tyrian purple dye, sufficient to color a single trim for a garment.

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dedicated about two years of my life to learning how to grow opals and studying opal science, photonics, light-interactive materials. And, when I grew my first opal, it was this little clear, whitish blob, and I shined a light on it, and it just lit up with all these brilliant greens and blues and flashes of orange. And I freaked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was, in my book, the coolest thing I had ever made, hands down. And I took it, put it under the microscope, put the camera up to it, got to look at it up close. And I was like, “I think I’ve literally made a whole separate universe of color.” There were all these dazzling colors and flashes of light. Every time I rotated the light, the colors changed. I thought to myself, I’ve learned so much about color and light play from studying opals, I could probably write a book on it. That’s when I went to my coauthor, Terry Mudge. I was like, “Hey man, you have all these weird materials in your science shop. What if I photograph some of your weird objects and we write a whole science book about color?” And he was like, “Yeah, let’s do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;542&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/wJGFEjKB-Lambert_BREAKER.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1160831&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COPPER FLOWER:&lt;/strong&gt; Chalcanthite is an electric blue sulfate mineral that forms in dry arid caves and copper mines.

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a definitive answer. Pinks and purples don’t really have a wavelength on the visible light spectrum. They’re sort of in between red and violet, so I’ve come to have a fun appreciation for them. Probably one of my favorite colors in the purple realm is Tyrian purple. It was a color that was reserved for Roman emperors, for royalty, and that’s because it took around 10,000 predatory sea snails to create about 1 gram of this pigment. So a lot of snails were killed to produce just a tiny amount. It was thought that fabric dyed in Tyrian purple fetched its weight in silver. But nowadays there is a lab, and scientists found a way to trick bacteria into producing the molecule that’s responsible for the color Tyrian purple. So instead of killing sea snails, they centrifuge the bacteria down into these colorful pellets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are colors for? Why do they exist in the first place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we see color, what we’re looking at are the distinct wavelengths of visible light. We have visible light that is on the electromagnetic spectrum. Visible light is this tiny little sliver that humans experience. With visible light, we have all the wavelengths that make colors from violet to everything in between to red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When something has color, there are different sources. Certain particles are energized. For example, maybe electrons are elevated to a higher energy state. When the particles drop, that energy release is perceived as light in color. Some materials absorb different wavelengths and reflect others. If something has a blue and green iridescence, that surface is absorbing every wavelength except blues and greens. That’s bouncing back to the viewer. We perceive those wavelengths as certain colors but that information still exists, whether or not we can see it.&lt;/p&gt;

In parts of Europe, people also once used it to poison scavenging animals, stuffing meat or reindeer carcasses with crushed lichen and powdered glass. The lichen’s bright yellow-green color comes not from chlorophyll but from a poisonous acid. &lt;em&gt;Photo by Tyler Thrasher.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can we learn about color from other creatures?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite facts in the book is that bees see visible light, but they also see UV at the same time. If you ever get the chance, you should shine a UV light on certain flowers, like dandelions or gentiana [known for their trumpet-shaped flowers that are often shaded an intense blue]. Bees can see all these patterns on the flowers under UV light and they act like landing strips. When you look at a whole garden under UV light, you can see these flowers that have rings or stripes that almost lure the bee in and help guide them to the pollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite images in the book is blacklight, a type of ultraviolet light. How do you pick an interesting blacklight image? I didn’t want to just do a picture of a blacklight flipped on. So we used a flower that was UV reactive to showcase it.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have any colors of the past been lost?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some colors are lost to history, like Mayan blue. It was used ritualistically. We first got glimpses of Mayan blue when we would go diving in cenotes. The bottoms of these wells were burial grounds. We would find skulls and remains that had this molecule on them, this blue. We’d find it on the walls and on altars. For the longest time we couldn’t figure out this blue. How was it made? Then a Mexican artist, who was an amateur scientist—I don’t think he had a degree to explore this—he just did it on his own, recreated Mayan blue for the culture. Recreated Mayan blue! He brought back a color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;542&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Lambert_BREAKER-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1160829&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIRROR, MIRROR: &lt;/strong&gt;This is a picture of two mirrors facing each other.

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I call myself a citizen scientist because I don’t have a degree. But I don’t think that that should kick me out of the practice of science and exploration. I am engaged with my society, community, and have a scientific view of the world. I make observations and communicate to my peers. It is the same work as science except I’m not putting it in a journal necessarily. I am sharing what I find to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any amateur astrophotographer is a citizen scientist. The gardener trying to get back to planting natives, to help with soil erosion and native pollinators. Those people are citizen scientists because they’re contributing to something that will have some effect. We don’t know the effect yet, but they’re keen to learn what those results are in the hope that it benefits humanity. That’s citizen science: science that’s available to the public. &lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13765&quot; style=&quot;width: 14px;&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lead image: Polygon Studios Mx / Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is part of series of &lt;/em&gt;Nautilus&lt;em&gt; interviews with artists, you can read the rest &lt;a aria-label=&quot;here (opens in a new tab)&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot; href=&quot;https://nautil.us/art-science/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science and superstition have had a complicated relationship throughout history, and artist and author Ellen Weinstein is interested in both. Her book, &lt;em&gt;Recipes for Good Luck&lt;/em&gt;, documents and illustrates the rituals and superstitions of noteworthy figures, from poets to NASA engineers. More recently she illustrated “&lt;a href=&quot;https://nautil.us/your-memories-are-like-paintings-774424/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Your Memories Are Like Paintings&lt;/a&gt;,” the cover story of &lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt; Issue 58, about how our brains alter our memories of the past. Weinstein, a self-described superstitious woman herself, recently sat down to answer our questions about her creative process, her own rituals, and what science and art have in common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What drew you to the arts in the first place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a kid, I would draw and write stories for hours. Growing up in New York City, I saw beautifully illustrated posters on the streets and in the subways and realized that was what I wanted to do: create art that was seen in public. I applied to and attended the High School of Art and Design and started on this path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you know when a project is finished?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deadlines certainly help; I need a container of time for a project. It helps to step away and return with a fresh eye, to find that sweet spot between unfinished and overworked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;2560&quot; height=&quot;1706&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Ellen-Weinstein-interview-nautilus-2-scaled.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1132032&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;Five Stories, Holiday House Books 2024. &lt;em&gt;Image courtesy of Ellen Weinstein.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In addition to illustrating other people’s books, you also write and illustrate your own. How does your process change when you’re not just interpreting someone else’s text, but writing and illustrating your own?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a book is a way to follow my curiosity and see where it goes. I sought known figures’ superstitions, rituals, and practices in &lt;em&gt;Recipes for Good Luck&lt;/em&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;Five Stories&lt;/em&gt;, a later book, I ask what it was like for my grandmother, as a child, to leave everything behind and start a new life in a strange place. I research and investigate a subject and write a rough draft of the manuscript. Then I go back and forth with sketching and revising the manuscript and research to shape the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve illustrated books for children and books for adults. Do you approach projects for kids versus projects for adults any differently?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether illustrating and writing for kids or adults, I want to work with respect for my audience and leave narrative space for them to see themselves in the story and have their interpretations. I enjoy the structure of telling a story from beginning to end in a picture book, and the ability to create a narrative through a series of short essays and illustrations.&lt;/p&gt;

Were there any that particularly spoke to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have superstitions and rituals, but one of the examples from the book that especially resonated with me was that Theodore Seuss Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, kept a collection of 300 hats. When faced with writer’s block, he would choose a hat to wear until he felt inspired. I have rituals for projects to “stay in character” while working on the project. For &lt;em&gt;Five Stories&lt;/em&gt;, I created a music playlist for each of the years in the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You created the art for our most recent cover story, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://nautil.us/your-memories-are-like-paintings-774424/&quot;&gt;Your Memories Are Like Paintings&lt;/a&gt;,” about how our brains reinterpret the past.

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subject of memories and how we interpret the past immediately resonated with me. What we edit out of our memories, what we remember, and how those memories of a specific time or incident will differ from others. My sister and I have different recollections of our childhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;2389&quot; height=&quot;2560&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Ellen-Weinstein-interview-nautilus-1-scaled.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1132018&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 2389px) 100vw, 2389px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;Nautilus: Issue 58 cover. &lt;em&gt;By Ellen Weinstein&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re a third-generation New Yorker with deep roots in your community, and your book, &lt;em&gt;Five Stories&lt;/em&gt;, explores the history of your neighborhood. During that process, did you discover any of your memories had changed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My research combines historical documents (census reports, archival photographs, newspapers, and books) with lived experiences through oral histories and interviews to get a fuller picture of people’s everyday lives. I searched for a photograph of a store I remember from childhood, and was relieved to find I didn’t make it up. A common refrain I hear when interviewing neighbors and friends is “Back in the day.” I think we all have different ideas of what that means.&lt;/p&gt;

What is it about science that inspires you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science was a favorite subject of mine in school and has remained one as an adult. Art and science raise questions, and I enjoy the inquiry and pursuit of an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything you think scientists can learn from artists—or vice versa?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think art and science involve failure as part of the process. They both also require dogged persistence to keep going and experimentation. Perhaps in both, we are hoping for a “breakthrough” in solving a problem, but that result can come from a long, slow series of cracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have any upcoming projects you’re excited about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do, but I am too superstitious to share them with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interview by Jake Currie. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

From the ultrafast zeptosecond to the billions of years that the universe has been in existence, we can easily measure time’s passage. Yet some scientists question whether it is even fundamentally real.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While the concept of time can feel impossible to capture, that hasn’t stopped artist Lia Halloran from trying. Many of her projects tackle how scale and time shift our perception of reality. In her 2022 piece &lt;em&gt;Double Horizon&lt;/em&gt;, a 3-channel video installation piece, she projected divergent but closely related images of Los Angeles from a series of repeated flights she made over the city as she learned to fly. In her 2008 &lt;a href=&quot;https://liahalloran.com/dark-skate-los-angeles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dark Skate&lt;/em&gt;, she skateboarded at night through different venues in Los Angeles, using light to draw an ephemeral line through a series of photographs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fall, Halloran has two new exhibits that are part of an expansive art event taking place across Southern California and organized by the Getty, called PST ART: Art &amp;amp; Science Collide.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;One of those exhibits is a series of oil paintings called &lt;em&gt;Night Watch&lt;/em&gt;, which attempts to examine how machines and tools might symbolize the natural passage of time. Another is &lt;em&gt;You, Me, and Infinity&lt;/em&gt;, a single work that combines painting and cyanotype—a print made by exposing a UV-sensitive chemical-coated paper to sunlight—to visualize eight layers of scale, from her own growing children to gravitational waves to vacuum fluctuations at the moment of the Big Bang.&amp;nbsp; I spoke with Halloran about using time as a tool to make art and what inspires her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;516&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Neith_BREAKER-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1116955&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIMEKEEPER:&lt;/strong&gt; Lia Halloran in her studio in Los Angeles. &lt;em&gt;Photo by Adam Ottke.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In your new collection of paintings called&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Night Watch&lt;/em&gt;, what are you trying to say about time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been toying with the notion of calling them “time landscapes.” In many of the pieces, you’ll see something is changing, which means it’s going from one state to the other, whether that’s expanding, contracting, moving. In one, you can see something that references some kind of horizon. It’s not a solid depiction of a mountain or ice, but it absolutely could be. The pieces underneath the horizon are a reference to a crystalline form that’s growing because I was thinking “What’s another earth-bound way that we can reference these long expanses of time?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another set basically represents the seasons. There are four of them that rotate through our year. I’m fascinated by how our body itself understands time on larger scales. I really want to invite the viewer to a sense of awe and let them take it from there in a different direction. Even the title itself evokes the viewer’s participation. It’s not about what’s out there, it’s about your observation and perception of what’s out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where did the ideas for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Night Watch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; come from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had been thinking a lot about the way that technology mediates our understanding of things. I took my students on a field trip to Mount Wilson Observatory, which is something that I do often. I teach a course called “The Intersection of Art and Science” at Chapman University, and it’s part of the course. There’s something so magical about being on these telescopes. It feels like a loving act of trying to reach out to something. I write notes to myself about my own work, and I was thinking of [telescopes] as machines of longing. Even our understanding of these senses of time or measurement are really mediated through technology. It was actually through that thinking of how technology mediates the embodiment of our experience that I came to make this series. The first pieces that I made were based on star trails from this night at Mount Wilson Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Neith_BREAKER-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1116965&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIVISION, 2023&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Night Watch&lt;/em&gt; series by Lia Halloran, oil on canvas, 36 x 24 inches. &lt;em&gt;Photo by Adam Ottke.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other project commissioned for PST ART, &lt;em&gt;You, Me, and Infinity&lt;/em&gt;, is a large-scale piece that melds cyanotype and paint, building on your past work in cyanotypes and exploring different concepts of scale. What role does time play in this medium?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyanotypes not only just use astronomy to make them—we’re using the power of the sun instead of the power of a dark room—but it is based on where the Earth is in relation to the sun in the season. So, there is an element of time, but it’s not as simple as you probably think. I can only make them between June and late September because the angle of the sun changes so drastically in the sky. Starting in the fall, it starts to angle down, and therefore the exposure times of the cyanotypes start changing so drastically that it becomes nearly impossible to get the right print with the right exposure time.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I wanted to do something that anchored these levels of scale to something that was very personal. And so I enlisted my two young children, who are 3 and 6. And in the actual piece, they just literally lay down on the negative. We’re so fascinated with the changing scale of our bodies in childhood. It’s just inherent to what childhood is, right? Even my wife and I, every week, are like, “Is he getting bigger?” So the piece itself draws from different archival or historic moments in science, but it also has very personal gestures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of telescopes as machines of longing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do you find inspiration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am just very fascinated and curious about the natural world. But I also want to be careful not to put science on a pedestal and challenge the nature of discovery and even our own personal narratives and experiences in that lineage.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s this 1977 film that was influential for me called &lt;em&gt;The Powers of 10&lt;/em&gt; by Charles and Ray Eames. It starts with this man who’s asleep on a picnic blanket. It goes out into the universe, and then it goes down into the small scale of his cells. The reason I loved it so much was because it anchored the body. I think that’s why we’re passionate about things, why we’re curious about things, because science, as an embodied experience, is an amazing invitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As an associate professor and chair of the art department at Chapman University, what role do you think art can play in science outreach and education?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we exist in our society, we’re all consumers of interdisciplinary culture. We are watching the election, but we’re also fascinated with the discovery of gravitational waves, or what Beyoncé’s next album is. Those things are simultaneously exciting, why can’t they exist in one space? As a teacher, the first class I developed was called “The Intersection of Art and Science” and was a partnership with the Jet Propulsion Lab. My students would visit, and they made work about current NASA missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love the conversations about what art and science have to do with one another. Most everyone is like, “everything.” There are so many overlaps. But if there’s one thing that both artists and scientists are all thinking about, it’s the nature of scale. The scale of time, the scale of distance, the scale of size, the scale of measurement. I had a microbiology student who was doing surgeries on the reproductive organs of fruit flies, using these crazy microscopes, doing testicular surgery. How can human fingers even do that?&lt;/p&gt;

How did that affect your artistic process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were looking to make a book that didn’t exist before that would sort of transport the viewer. It was very, very iterative. And that’s because Kip would come draw on top of my paintings. It was like the paintings drove the words, in poetry and prose, just as much as the prose drove the paintings. The book is really a representation of a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those paintings are singularly very different than anything in my studio practice, because I knew that [the book] was for a wide audience. Kip wrote in poetic prose, so I wanted the paintings to have that elegance to them that you could tell they’re painted so simply, but somehow you look at it and it could not be any other way.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes me a very, very long time to think of a project. But I made this series 12 years ago that was also looking at this notion of time. I was thinking about the classification of the natural world in two forms, one the personal and one the scientific. And what better form to lean on than the periodic table of elements? And so I made this piece, which was complete in and of itself, but I really thought of as a draft. It’s a combination of the elements merged with people who were in my life. I photographed friends, ex-girlfriends, like an intimate catalog of my world. I always felt there was more there, so the next thing I want to do draws from the discoveries in Los Angeles that relate to the periodic table. That would involve tapping into some of the fantastic institutions, the Getty Research Center, The Huntington, the collection at Mount Wilson. There’s such an incredible wealth to mine from that I’m interested in doing an expansive research-focused project. &lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13765&quot; style=&quot;width: 14px;&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lia Halloran’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.luisdejesus.com/exhibitions/lia-halloran5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is on display at Luis de Jesus Los Angeles from November 9 through December 21. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://liahalloran.com/you-me-and-infinity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;You, Me, and Infinity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; can be viewed in Caltech’s Dabney Lounge through December 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lead image: &lt;/em&gt;Cycle&lt;em&gt;, 2023, by Lia Halloran.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is part of series of &lt;/em&gt;Nautilus&lt;em&gt; interviews with artists, you can read the rest &lt;a aria-label=&quot;here (opens in a new tab)&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot; href=&quot;https://nautil.us/art-science/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artist Tim O’Brien has been a cultural force. Not only did he illustrate the covers for the popular &lt;em&gt;Hunger Games&lt;/em&gt; novels, he also created the iconic series of &lt;em&gt;Time Magazine&lt;/em&gt; covers depicting the scandals swirling around Donald Trump’s presidency. If you haven’t seen O’Brien’s art there, you’ve probably seen it in the pages of &lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt;—most recently in our Reality Issue. He recently sat down to answer our questions about his creative process, the inspiration he draws from science, and what’s wrong with using AI to create art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you decide pursuing art was the path you wanted to take?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was able to draw accurately as a child; all my life I could do this thing that not everyone could do. It seemed inevitable that I would eventually lean into this skill and learn in college how I might make a living as an illustrator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You work in oil paints on a lot of projects with a quick turnaround time. Can you walk us through your process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A job starts with a piece of paper and a pencil. I do rough sketches that sometimes only I can tell what they mean. When one seems right, I then take that sketch and develop it into a sketch I can share with an art director. This sketch is always done digitally, drawing directly on my Cintiq screen in photoshop. This digital beginning allows for multiple iterations, edits, color explorations, and finally, a solid image to take to final. Upon approval, I then work in oil on panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil paint is a wet medium but it is flexible and forgiving. When the painting is finished I photograph it wet, and send that file to clients. This all sounds like it takes a long time, but it’s a quick process, something I’ve been doing for many years now.&lt;/p&gt;

Everyone understands what is real, and taking things that people commonly understand and subverting it or changing it slightly can be a fun trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You also created two realistic depictions of the famous rabbit/duck optical illusion for the &lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt; story “&lt;a href=&quot;https://nautil.us/how-your-brain-decides-without-you-235149/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;How Your Brain Decides Without You&lt;/a&gt;.” How did you approach such a visually ambiguous subject?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was a collaboration with then art director Len Small who suggested I try the old visual pun of the rabbit/duck. I knew of it so I just tried to do it realistically. The second option, of the reflection, was one that I thought of as an alternate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/4639_33b879e7ab79f56af1e88359f9314a10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;Nautilus: How Your Brain Decides Without You. &lt;em&gt;By Tim O’Brien&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything in science that inspires you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a person who watches those I love deal with ailments all the time, any medical breakthrough—be it a vaccine that saves millions of lives or a new approach to stopping a tumor from growing—is the kind of science I hope and pray for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You created the series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/5928282/donald-trump-time-covers/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time Magazine&lt;/em&gt; covers&lt;/a&gt; of Donald Trump behind the Resolute desk as a storm gathers and eventually floods the Oval Office. It’s the first time I remember seeing a series of &lt;em&gt;Time Magazine&lt;/em&gt; covers with a narrative arc to them. How did that idea come about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The creative director, D.W. Pine asked me to come up with the first image of Trump in a storm. I chose the desk, the pose, and the neutral face as the direction I hoped to go in. In subsequent versions, I pitched those as possible covers as the Trump administration was constantly in the middle of a crisis. The metaphor of the rising water was a perfect fit for the continual storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/4638_f08b7ac8aa30a2a9ab34394e200e1a71.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;Nautilus: How Your Brain Decides Without You. &lt;em&gt;By Tim O’Brien&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rise of generative AI services like Midjourney is causing some controversy in the art world. What are your thoughts on the use of AI to create art?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am against it on moral and legal grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generative AI output can only exist with the works of human artists. It has been trained mainly on stealing images and no human is compensated for that training. The power of copyright affords artists and authors the right to own their works for a limited time, to encourage the very creation of said work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am also against it as a tool that an artist uses. I am only interested in the work of human artists and for creativity and individuality to flourish, humans need to use their brains to solve their own visual problems and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As an artist who’s illustrated the covers of several novels, do you judge books by their covers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have created hundreds of book covers in my career, including all of the &lt;em&gt;Hunger Games&lt;/em&gt; book covers. I’ve done wonderful covers on great books and mediocre books. All publishers hope that the cover sells the book, so yes, we do hope that great covers mean great books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has creating cover art changed the way you look at book covers at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love looking at book covers and can walk through a bookstore for hours. So many amazing images and ideas to see and they’re all like little one-frame movies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A new exhibition highlighting this driving force of nature, as seen through arresting photographs and other artworks, premiered at Art Basel Paris this month and is now on display at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris and online. The show, &lt;em&gt;Resilience: Artistic Solutions for Human, Ocean, and Biodiversity Challenges&lt;/em&gt;, was born out of a partnership with UNESCO, &lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt;, Dona Bertarelli Philanthropy, and Discover Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show invites viewers to contemplate resilience manifested broadly, in the natural world and in the human one, as a blend of quiet persistence and defiance in the midst of catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/fwhybhAT-Steele_BREAKER.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1005486&quot; style=&quot;width:675px;height:auto&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Serenity by Dhir Jakharia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

In one work, we witness a polar bear stepping across the gap between two glaciers in Svalbard, Norway. In another, a thriving tropical coral reef grows right up to the roots of a mangrove forest in Indonesia. Still another pictures an elephant strolling through a misty Kenyan morning near the foot of Mt. Kilimanjaro, the whole scene awash in golden light.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;583&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/0pmgPtI3-breaker.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1009159&quot; style=&quot;width:675px;height:auto&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ms. Nabila Rahmania; Indonesia, Credit: @mattporteous&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companion piece is &lt;a href=&quot;https://nautil.us/tsunami-sea-change-for-resilience/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tsunami: Sea Change for Resilience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a series of photographs and monumental paintings that consider the plight of those who have suffered through and survived tsunamis. These towering walls of water, capable of wiping entire communities off the map, leave in their wake a seemingly insurmountable devastation. Yet, the indefatigable human spirit always finds a way to rebuild. Homes are reconstructed, families reconnected, and societies re-knit themselves with remarkable grit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as we face an era of unprecedented environmental loss, these collective works serve as a potent reminder that nature is not only fragile but also profoundly tenacious, that the will to survive endures. &lt;/p&gt;

It looked as if tiny elm trees, surrounded by shrubs and hedges, had been skillfully drawn inside the egg-shaped cup. “What really amazed me was, you look at it and you see a trunk is growing down from the bottom, and there’s branches, and they are pretty well resolved, and there’s kind of this little fuzz, where the leaves would be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/pBgCUT2b-Kazamia_BREAKER.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-940606&quot; style=&quot;width:675px;height:auto&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by Robert Hamers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamers had set out to grow “a very large” crystal of lithium cobalt dioxide, the material used in the batteries powering mobile phones, laptops, video cameras, and other gadgets. He planned to use it to develop a fingerprint of the chemical in nature, through a technique known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780323461405000042&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt;. Once developed, the fingerprint could be used to scan landfill sites and other environments for the leaked chemical from discarded batteries, tracing the chemical to its end of life, Hamers says.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a long lead up time to cracking open the sealed crucible. First, a few bits of lithium cobalt oxide were speckled inside, an ink-black powder to the naked eye. These small crystals are the seed from which the larger crystal can grow, building on the lattice structure that grows in the presence of lithium salts. Extremely high temperatures are required—reaching beyond 1,292 degrees Fahrenheit—which the crucible can withstand inside a special furnace. Then the cooling begins: Larger crystals only form if the cooling period is extremely slow—in this case the scientists gave it two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the experiment failed: The crystals that grew inside the crucible weren’t big enough for the tests Hamers wanted to do. But his enchanting photo of the result &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.wisc.edu/2024-winners-cool-science-image-contest/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;won one of the awards&lt;/a&gt; of the university’s annual Cool Science Image Contest.

    &lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, I’ve been trying to write novels that resituate human beings inside the interconnected webs of a living planet. After exploring dense forest networks in&lt;a href=&quot;https://nautil.us/the-woman-redeemed-by-trees-237040/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Overstory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and confronting mass extinction and ecoanxiety in&lt;a href=&quot;https://nautil.us/what-is-life-238301/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bewilderment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I realized that I needed to turn my attention to the immense wellspring of all life on Earth: the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most people, I knew from way back in grade school that the oceans cover more than 70 percent of the planet’s surface. And I had a good sense of their depth—a little more than 12,000 feet. What I didn’t appreciate until I started writing &lt;em&gt;Playground&lt;/em&gt; was just how much livable space that represented, compared to terrestrial habitats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On land, multicellular life stays pretty close to the surface. But every depth of the ocean is inhabited, in numbers that we are just beginning to appreciate. There are dragon fish, carnivorous sponges, zombie worms, and countless other kinds of exotic organisms—most of them still undiscovered—living throughout the Mariana Trench, the deepest trench in the world. (The wildest of these deep-sea creatures might be the various species of barreleye fish, with their telescoping eyes, bioluminescent organs, and large transparent heads.) Even at the very bottom, in the Challenger Deep, nearly 7 miles below the surface where it was long thought nothing could live, shrimp and sea cucumbers abound.&lt;/p&gt;

His 2018 novel, &lt;em&gt;The Overstory&lt;/em&gt;, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, explored dense forest networks. His new novel, &lt;em&gt;Playground&lt;/em&gt;, dives into the ecology of the oceans. &lt;em&gt;Photo by Kevin Berger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing the inhabitable terrain of the ocean to that of the land yields a startling statistic: The ocean represents something very close to 99 percent of the biosphere. Spread out as far as we might, we humans still can’t occupy more than 1 or 2 percent of the livable space on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As large as the volume of inhabitable water is, a global system of currents slowly and perpetually mixes it. Thermohaline circulation, sometimes called the global ocean conveyor belt, moves an immense amount of water—more than a dozen times the flow of all the world’s rivers combined—at the speed of a few centimeters per second on a path that traverses all the latitudes and threads through all the globe’s oceans. Any given quantity of water is estimated to take somewhere between 1,000 and 1,500 years to make the entire circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest synchronous movement of biomass on the planet happens every night, as countless tons of zooplankton rise from the deep up to the surface and sink down again every morning. Fish, crustaceans, and mollusks follow them in what is called the diel vertical migration, covering distances over half a mile in each direction. Until I wrote this book, I thought of the great living journeys as moving mostly north to south, when in reality it’s up and down.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; I Fell in Love with Manta Rays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are more kinds of fish than all the mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians put together. Three fifths of every creature with a backbone is a fish. Their ability to sense the world exceeds our own in many ways. Most bony fish are tetrachromats; they see in four different color channels, perceiving color much more vividly than most of us. Many can see light in the near ultraviolet spectrum, which we cannot. In some ways, their hearing surpasses ours, and they have more ways of making sounds than any other group of vertebrates. Fish can be trained to distinguish between different kinds of musical styles. And that’s not to mention their extraordinary powers of chemical and electroreception. Their taste and smell can surpass our own by as many as four magnitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It stunned me to read about their powers of cognition. Swimming over a tidal pool at high tide, a goby can memorize the entire layout of the terrain after only one exposure. So can a frillfin, calculating precisely where the pools will be at low tide. Archerfish can learn a skill by watching others at a distance, an ability known as perspective-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;What impressed me the most about the oceans while I researched this book was how little we know about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While writing &lt;em&gt;Playground, &lt;/em&gt;I fell in love with manta rays&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; whose cognitive abilities went way beyond what I ever imagined. They have the largest brain of any fish, one of the two or three largest relative to their body size. They are exceptionally playful and curious, and they practice coordinated social behavior. Manta rays in at least three different aquariums around the world have learned how to swim onto stretchers for transport. Mantas even display contingency checking and other signs of self-awareness in front of a mirror, passing the so-called mirror self-recognition test. While the full significance of such tests are controversial, it’s worth pointing out that many kinds of primates and very smart mammals including dogs cannot pass them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Almost All of the Ocean Is Unexplored&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What impressed me the most about the oceans while I researched this book was how little we know about them. According to NOAA, we have explored only 5 percent of the oceans and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nautil.us/why-is-it-so-difficult-to-map-the-ocean-436109/?_sp=7fcb0a98-bcaa-4fd2-8f66-6a709be04a78.1727121159263&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;mapped&lt;/a&gt; only about one quarter of the seafloor in high resolution. Scientists estimate that roughly 1 million species live in the oceans (excluding microorganisms, which would push the total far higher). Of that number, two thirds or more &lt;a href=&quot;https://nautil.us/the-oceans-are-teeming-with-unknown-species-238480/?_sp=7fcb0a98-bcaa-4fd2-8f66-6a709be04a78.1727121281333&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;remain to be discovered&lt;/a&gt; or described. (I’ve seen estimates up to 90 percent.) Almost 2,000 new species are being identified every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for well-known sea creatures, our sense of aquatic populations are often crude at best. There may be more fish living in the twilight zone between about 650 and 3,300 feet than in all the rest of the ocean combined. Three times as many kinds of life live on or near the ocean bottom as live in the upper ocean, and the great majority of those species have not yet been identified. The biological processes at these depths play a central role in the sequestration of the globe’s carbon and the regulation of Earth’s atmosphere, but we have very little knowledge of the specifics of those processes.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our greatest and most catastrophic ignorance is how little we know about our own impact on a place we once thought we could never much alter. Some scientists talk about “dark plastic,” estimating that 99 percent of the plastic we have put into the ocean can’t subsequently be located or traced. Just half a dozen years ago, researchers discovered whole new ecosystems based on floating plastic debris, replete with coastal creatures floating in the middle of the ocean. And even as we are finally beginning to model the incredibly complex ocean engine that regulates the climate of the planet, we are tipping the world’s currents in directions that we can’t yet predict with necessary precision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our knowledge about the ocean is expanding rapidly, but so is our impact upon it. Maybe the biggest revelation I had while writing &lt;em&gt;Playground&lt;/em&gt; was a bit of wisdom that Polynesians have known for a very long time. In her essential book, &lt;em&gt;How the Ocean Works&lt;/em&gt;, Helen Czerski quotes the Hawaiian phrase, &lt;em&gt;He moku he wa’a, he wa’a he moku&lt;/em&gt;. “A canoe is an island, and an island is a canoe.” This unknown water planet is an island in the emptiness of incalculable space. It’s also our canoe. &lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13765&quot; style=&quot;width: 14px;&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lead image: JENG BO YUAN / Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://nautil.us/our-magnificent-ocean-889177/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://nautil.us/our-magnificent-ocean-889177/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2024 14:57:38 GMT</pubDate><author>Richard Powers</author></item><item><title>When Einstein and Kafka Met</title><description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/SBFAkONC-Krimstein_HERO.png&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;   &lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image aligncenter size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;1334&quot; height=&quot;1611&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/QxS4uzbL-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-873573&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 1334px) 100vw, 1334px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;* Berta Fanta, 1865–1918.

Now based in New York, Buzelli’s illustrations have appeared in &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, if you’re a regular &lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt; reader, you’ll recognize Buzelli’s surreal style from a number of our covers. We recently caught up with him to ask about his career path, why he prefers working with physical media, and his thoughts on AI and art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you decide pursuing art was the path you wanted to take?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well I’m not sure if or when I officially decided but it felt like it was the only path for me. I started oil painting as a kid in my grandfather’s television repair shop. So I guess the choices were to become a television repairman (now extinct) or an artist. Luckily I had a few people nudge me in the right direction along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By working in oil paints instead of digitally, you stand apart from a lot of other illustrators. Why do you prefer oils?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m much quicker and more proficient at painting with oils than pushing pixels around. And I have the added bonus of a physical painting at the end of each illustration project which sometimes gets sold at a gallery or directly to a collector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you know when a project is finished?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could probably work and overwork a painting to death but luckily most illustration projects have short deadlines. I can usually tell when a piece is finished if the concept is clear and I’m satisfied with the execution. Or I ask my wife!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;2308&quot; height=&quot;2560&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/56-ChrisBuzelli-copy-scaled.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-868336&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 2308px) 100vw, 2308px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;Nautilus: The Force was With Them. &lt;em&gt;By Chris Buzelli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You created the illustration for Walter Murch’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://nautil.us/the-force-was-with-them-663645/&quot;&gt;cover story&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt; Issue 56 about bursts of creativity and innovation throughout history, particularly in film. As a creative person yourself, what about that story captured your imagination?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s rare that a story truly sparks my interests, but fortunately this one did. I loved how the author paralleled great achievements of history and achievements of film. The part about how we are “simply being carried like foam on the waves of history … agents of the great unraveling of time and space” really struck a chord with me and was the main driving force for the cover illustration.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rise of generative AI services is causing some controversy in the art world. What are your thoughts on the use of AI to create art?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who knows? When I first started out as an illustrator, many professors and professional illustrators said it was the “end of illustration” mostly because print was transitioning to web, cheap stock art had begun, and illustration budgets were stagnant. These factors forced me to slightly adjust and change and maybe progress in many ways to survive in the industry. I think the same is happening with AI and art now. It will definitely have a great effect on the industry but I don’t think it will be the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;900&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/326308905_478506497603615_2177192623575339147_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-861829&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;United States Postal Service: Puppy Love. &lt;em&gt;Image courtesy of Chris Buzelli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States Postal Service selected you to design two forever stamps, what was the process like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process included many months of back and forth with the USPS design team on the conceptual direction for the Forever Love stamps. Then once we decided on the Puppy Love and Kitty Love stamp, it was a few more months of final sketches, color options, and then the final paintings. I still get blown away when I see my stamps at my local post office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve done several memorable covers for &lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt;.

The medical discharge report read in part, “You experienced an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest … fortunately you were able to be revived.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the conciseness and lack of drama in this description, something the late poet and painter Fawzi Karim once addressed in relation to reality in art and the pursuit of it:&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;padd-h-lg&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a consequence of being here, I have become very close to the idea of the simple sentence, one in which there is no exaggerated feeling or idea or belief. It is better to leave things just as they are. Once you add these other things you misjudge, you become unjust.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was my daughter who found me collapsed in our kitchen. I don’t remember the legion of emergency personnel who came into our house attempting to revive me, the activity, the noise, the medical detritus left behind, the neighbors no doubt gathered outside awaiting a glimpse of the person who inevitably would be brought out on a stretcher, necks craning in a search for answers as happens in a neighborhood when something out of the ordinary breaks the silence. I don’t remember anything of the next five or so days, or anything in the 24 hours prior to the event. The entire experience is difficult to piece together. What is primarily left for me is the face of my daughter recounting the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point in the days after admittance, I self-extubated in the I.C.U. After regaining consciousness, I was in a state of bewilderment, pain, and confinement. I had breathing difficulties due to blood in the lungs, perhaps a laryngeal injury caused by my inexpert and violent removal of the breathing tube. It wasn’t entirely clear to me what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Someone asked what I was “after” in my work; what did I hope to achieve?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I slowly retrained my senses to the realities around me, moving through the weeks that followed with at once lucidity and a structural sense of disconnectedness, both states co-existing in an effort to return to a meaningful normalcy. The most terrifying part of the ordeal was not, in fact, landing on that line between life and death, but simply the lack of agency and day-to-day clarity during that emergent period upon stepping back from it; restriction, confusion, and misapplication of power reigning overall. These things still haunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On reflection, I have discovered that my attitudes toward work, toward composing and the internal momentums therein, remain similar to how I felt about these things before the cardiac arrest. This is a bit surprising, in that there is some expectation one should, perhaps, approach things differently after what are at least outwardly transformative and demarcating experiences. While it is unclear to me whether I have moved forward as an artist, I have in the past year, however, found myself in new territories of deliberateness—concurrent, energized states of cognizance and intuitiveness, composure and presentiment—and a yielding, perhaps (perhaps not), of new ways of hearing, of seeing. I feel, imagine, a renewed sense of resoluteness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;88&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/YxvZLOjW-section-breaker.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-787506&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;padd-h-lg&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The truth about the world … is that … had you not seen it all from birth and thereby bled it of its strangeness it would appear to you for what it is, a hat trick in a medicine show, a fevered dream, a trance bepopulate with chimeras having neither analogue nor precedent, an itinerant carnival, a migratory tentshow whose ultimate destination after many a pitch in many a mudded field is unspeakable and calamitous beyond reckoning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;—Cormac McCarthy,&lt;em&gt; Blood Meridian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone recently asked what I was “after” in my work; what did I hope to achieve? It seems a simple enough question. But beyond what has for much of my life felt a desperate urgency to write music, the excitement in attempting to capture a moment, a situation, a state of mind, a state of being, &lt;em&gt;aliveness&lt;/em&gt;, trying to reach for a succinct answer to this question in conversation is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answers I generally arrive at feel like weak attempts at characterizing something for which the work itself holds the answers. I do know that in the work to which I respond of other artists there is always an omnipresent exigency, even in the stillest, most delicate moments; palpability, something convincingly messaged through the art directly, even if it is difficult to capture in discussion; and above all, fearlessness, a clear willingness to proceed no matter the destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the death of a dear friend, I characterized the period thereafter as akin to being caught in an undertow. Even when regaining a sense of control, a distance and reemergence from the currents, I would inevitably and predominantly be pulled back to places of grief and disquiet. The relentlessness of return seems at times a kind of constitutional inability to fully come to terms. Perhaps this is more common than many wish to believe, a permanent, indestructible irresolution. Looking back upon my own work, a confrontation with irresolution seems to comprise in large part the engine which propels me to wrestle with these things, in this case through the prism of music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Hersch_BREAKER.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-787533&quot; style=&quot;width:676px;height:auto&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEEP BREATH:&lt;/strong&gt; Michael Hersch and vocalist Ah Young Hong discuss the score of Hersch’s &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;breath upwards&lt;/em&gt;, a vocal work, based on texts by Dante and Ezra Pound, in rehearsal for a 2016 recording. &lt;em&gt;Photo by Mike Maguire. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There also is a recurring engagement with varying forms of violence in my work, violences at the core, or at least at the origin points of the musical exploration. At times, the violence is within (illness), at times without (violence inflicted by one person or groups of people against another or others).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world of illness has shaped and informed my monodrama &lt;em&gt;On the Threshold of Winter&lt;/em&gt;, and the elegy, &lt;em&gt;I hope we get a chance to visit soon&lt;/em&gt;, these works engaging with loss to cancer, and to a lesser extent my own direct experiences with the disease. Examples of violences from without include my two recent operas: &lt;em&gt;Poppaea&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Medea&lt;/em&gt;, and a work for unaccompanied violin, &lt;em&gt;the weather and landscape are on our side&lt;/em&gt;, a cycle loosely structured on some of the last correspondence of writer and artist Bruno Schulz, who was shot on the street by a Nazi officer in 1942.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are certainly many instances where disquiet—that structural irresolution and a confrontation with these states that I am attempting to give shape to—presents as more environmental or atmospheric, a musical argument which is divorced from any explicit narrative or event. In struggling to quantify my most recent opera, &lt;em&gt;and we, each&lt;/em&gt;, I have written that the work is above all an exploration of the treacherous territories of relationships—between individuals, within societies and, ultimately, the collapse of both. The opera is based upon texts by poet Shane McCrae. From the last scene, McCrae writes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;padd-h-lg&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;… The couple stretched and broke …&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;… world in world … chaos flung on bones …&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;… where I meet you, we are here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked questions of motivation, and when considering the broad topic of reality, I am reminded of painter Francis Bacon’s “brutality of fact.” Bacon, responding to the notion that many perceive his work as horrific, said, “I’ve always hoped to put over things as directly and rawly as I possibly can, and perhaps if a thing comes across directly, they feel that that is horrific.”&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also think of something my friend, sculptor Christopher Cairns, has repeated over the years. He likes to quote painter Eugène Delacroix, who reportedly said he “liked the look of fresh blood.” Cairns feels Delacroix must have meant he was attempting to “get at reality,” that he was struggling to “get at something real” in his art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, Cormac McCarthy in &lt;em&gt;Blood Meridian:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;padd-h-lg&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;They found the lost scouts hanging head downward from the limbs of a fireblacked paloverde tree. They were skewered through the cords of their heels with sharpened shuttles of green wood and they hung gray and naked above the dead ashes of the coals where they’d been roasted until their heads had charred and the brains bubbled in the skulls … Their tongues were drawn out and held with sharpened sticks thrust through them and they had been docked of their ears and their torsos were sliced open with flints until the entrails hung down on their chests. Some of the men pushed forward with their knives and cut the bodies down and they left them there in the ashes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critic Caryn James, reflecting on McCarthy’s broader motivations, writes that “McCarthy has asked us to witness evil not in order to understand it but to affirm its inexplicable reality.”&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reality need not be the nightmarish, grim, complex worlds explored by McCarthy, though it commonly is. In my experience, the nature and work of an individual is frequently shaped more by the tragedies that befall them than by anything else, and the beautiful, the just moments in and of one’s life are often, if not inevitably, contoured by those darknesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;88&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/YxvZLOjW-section-breaker.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-787506&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was barely a year old when my 23-year-old aunt was killed in an accident. In later years, I would wonder how this event shaped my mother and her subsequent choices, the loss of her sister reminding her of reality in the starkest of terms at a relatively young age, the tangible knowledge that catastrophe is likely taking shape just over the horizon, just out of sight, but remaining diffused enough to silence or mask, only for a time, the threat. She suffered from bouts of intrusive anxiety that would constrain her life in various ways, but she always impressively overcame the obstacles that afflicted her, or for the most part seemed to.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, not long after the loss of her sister, her father died, a second trauma for her and for the family; catastrophe’s form having gathered and deployed once again. During his illness, my parents decided to send me to live with him during the period he underwent treatments. The seemingly relentless doctor and hospital visits unnerved me, but I wasn’t frightened for his imminent absence. This possibility didn’t occur to me. He exuded strength and permanence. I never sensed he was dying, though he did soon after. When I went through my own cancer treatments almost 30 years later, I tried to summon his courage, or what seemed a courageousness reflected through the eyes of a 7-year-old boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last visit I had with my dear friend, mentioned earlier, brought again into question my grasp of the realities around me, though without the excuse of childhood misapprehensions. Looking back now, I realize she was of course very near death. This was reflected in all aspects of her presence: her voice, her appearance, her almost fantastical and fanatical sense of optimism. But she was so persuasive in her optimism that she convinced me she would go on, she would continue to survive as she had done again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Hersch_BREAKER-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-787537&quot; style=&quot;width:675px;height:auto&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHROUD OF LEAVES:&lt;/strong&gt; A manuscript page from Michael Hersch’s work, &lt;em&gt;sew me into a shroud of leaves&lt;/em&gt;. The work comprises 153 movements and lasts some 10 hours of performance. The work is a catalog of Hersch’s shifting perspectives and experiences over the 15 years it took him to complete it.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a time our treatments overlapped. We went through a period when our varying cancer treatments were occurring simultaneously (though different cancers in different parts of the country). While I was mainly left with physical disfigurement, pain, anger, and speculation, these all-too-common things paled in the face of her death and the remaining questions thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She died in 2009, age 45. There has remained for me since her death a certain emotional defacement resulting from the miscalculation of not recognizing how near death she was at that time, the regret of not seeing what was right there in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The irresolution I often feel and recognize in the art to which I respond is, perhaps, as an acute grief which can take on the quality of amber-like immutability, a state never truly able to be moderated, only (often feebly) covered over. The attempt, though, to transform, to scrutinize, to break through, in my case to endeavor through music, is often terribly exciting. This I believe, even if eventually doomed, is the major propellant for my work. From the beginning, I have attempted to shape musical drama without obfuscation, without missing or passing by those things I wish to explore, though often difficult. I also recognize that some of the most beautiful art finds its beauty in the veneer, the facade, the mask, the shell. I, however, have generally been drawn to what is behind the bandages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;88&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/YxvZLOjW-section-breaker.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-787506&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost 25 years ago, I attended an exhibition in Rome of &lt;a href=&quot;https://buffaloakg.org/artworks/p199963921-14-images-locked-ward&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Michael Mazur&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;em&gt;The Inferno of Dante&lt;/em&gt;, a series of 41 etchings with accompanying texts of Dante in a translation by Robert Pinsky. It was a deeply moving experience. Mazur and I spoke, and soon after I performed a number of my works for him at the piano. A few years later, when my first recording of solo and chamber music was released, Mazur wrote a program note for it. Although I feel now very far from those works, as one does when time wrenches us forward and we find ourselves at a distance, Mazur’s words linger and remain present for me:&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;padd-h-lg&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is … the overwhelming sense of “sadness,” which is better than “doom.” In fact, the abyss in its finality is easy to portray: a rich black says it all. Dante is often thought to have made his poem [&lt;/em&gt;Inferno&lt;em&gt;] about doom and punishment for sin. He looked into the abyss but primarily found sadness there. Sadness is a much more complicated and, therefore, interesting human condition. It is harder to portray visually.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would make the case that this is similar in music. Mazur continued:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;padd-h-lg&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;These compositions are filled sometimes with frightening sounds. They are unrelenting, nearly without hope … But no artwork can be without hope since it is in the very nature of creative work to be optimistic, if only in as much as we continue to work through everything but our own death.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately a decade after our initial meeting, I intersected with Mazur’s artwork musically for the first time, resulting in a piece which is one of the only works I’ve written where both of the earlier noted elements of internal and external violences overtly collide. The piece is a string quartet titled &lt;em&gt;Images from a Closed Ward&lt;/em&gt;, a 13-movement cycle completed the year after Mazur’s death in 2009. The origin point for the quartet was Mazur’s “Locked Ward” series of images, a collection which struck me as a kind of real-world embodiment of much of what I had seen years before in his &lt;em&gt;Inferno&lt;/em&gt; imagery.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The artwork confronts the horrors of mental health treatment as Mazur witnessed it during the 1960s. In an interview with Cherie Doyle Riesenberg in 1988, Mazur relayed an anecdote regarding an early confrontation with a reality that fundamentally changed his approach to making art. He was 19 and was singing popular songs with a group of friends for women in a secured unit of a veteran’s hospital. In the midst of the performance, one of the soloists was violently attacked on the stage. Mazur noted, “I never forgot that. It was the first meeting with reality, with the darkest kind of reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her book, &lt;em&gt;Robert Lowell: Setting the River on Fire&lt;/em&gt;, psychologist Kay Redfield Jamison references art and truth in her writings on the 20th-century poet, though I think her utilizations of these terms are interchangeable with the term “reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;padd-h-lg&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;To create … art requires toughness, eyes that do not avert their gaze … that [do] not back away from the great, hard subjects: love, betrayal, suffering, madness, war, death. Truth is not always an uplifting thing; human nature is flawed … It is not for the faint of heart. Art is the “ruthless cutting edge that records and celebrates and prophesies on the stone tablets of time,” wrote the Scottish poet George Mackay Brown. Lowell, who spent time with Brown on his late-life trip to Orkney to trace the ancestral roots of his poetry and his own madness, put it plainly. “We must all live by taking a few uncontrolled screams—in our stride.”&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps somewhere in those screams is the something “real” that Cairns and Delacroix are talking about. Each of these artists, Lowell and McCarthy included, attempt to engage with and make sense of the world around them, the world as they see it with no attempt to anesthetize or becloud it. The work these artists create, that I am attracted to, does not shy away from, nor attempt to escape this world, as difficult and as ferocious as it can be. There seems little interest in constructing opacity.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I respond to in artists is fearlessness, a clear willingness to proceed no matter the destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, that notion of disquiet, the human difficulties often traversed in their work, are not devoid of those things one might characterize as beautiful; fully, absolutely, beautiful. Responding to negative reactions to his often-graphic work, painter Hyman Bloom stated his hope was to somehow bring a clear unity to the “harrowing and the beautiful.”&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karim’s approach to his work, his appeal to “the simple sentence,” of “no exaggerated feeling or idea or belief,” that it “is better to leave things just as they are,” is something I obsess over. In my own conversations with Karim, the idea of simplicity has nothing to do with an absence of complexity; it is about fidelity to one’s ideas, specifically what the artwork at hand requires, unto itself. This ultimately becomes something which relies on an instinct: an intuitive signal that the “reality” of the piece has been identified and engaged with. It is a search for a dignity in the essence of the piece. This dignity doesn’t refer to the overlooking of fear, of humiliation, degradation, the profane; things from which we might instinctively recoil. It is simply that whatever is being said is expressed with an ultimate clarity, a precision, the realities surrounding us in direct confrontation with the senses and imagination. It is a journey, above all, to simply get to the heart of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;88&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/YxvZLOjW-section-breaker.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-787506&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

Sebald&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;88&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/YxvZLOjW-section-breaker.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-787506&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, I completed &lt;em&gt;sew me into a shroud of leaves&lt;/em&gt;, a cycle of three works comprising 153 movements and lasting some 10 hours of performance time. While my work has changed since then, with a shift primarily to works for the theater and the voice, the cycle is in certain respects a catalog of my priorities, observations, shifting perspectives, above all, experiences, across a finite span of time, namely the 15 years it took me to complete the trilogy, which I began in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poetical fragments and textual connections from three different poets are interleaved throughout each of the cycle’s sections. Here I am not attempting to render these particular texts into music. Rather, I feel the texts share some expressive sensibility with the music, which is why they came to mind in the first place. They are more companions than anything else. The first part of the cycle intersects with the poetry of Christopher Middleton (the second with W.G. Sebald, the third with Marius Kociejowski). Oftentimes, there is a shocking juxtaposition of everyday circumstance and violence in Middleton’s work in particular. In his “Gentle Reader,” Middleton writes:&lt;/p&gt;

And then, later in the poem, in an abrupt shift, there are the images and sounds we turn away from. Middleton wants us to see these, too, and to hear”&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;padd-h-lg&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;… the shouts of thugs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clubbing to death with crowbars people&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rather shocked to find that this was happening&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A few doors only from home, for no good reason …&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last movement of Part I is paired with the only complete poem of this first part of the cycle, Middleton’s “Something Vesperal.”&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Interestingly, this example turns away from much of the confrontational darknesses explored by many of the artists I have referenced, including Middleton himself. This text communicates his characteristically elusive beauty:&lt;/p&gt;

Whether acutely present, looming nearby, or quietly stalking the distance, these places are with us as well, allowing us to feel at the outer limits of that which our capacities provide, to attempt to make sense of this world and the realities therein.&amp;nbsp; &lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13765&quot; style=&quot;width: 14px;&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lead image: Mike Maguire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Enamored, she plucked it, and carried it the whole several-hours-long hike home. Ever since that moment, mushrooms have been an object of Lalonde’s fascination and a staple of the imaginative world that informs her art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;1537&quot; height=&quot;2049&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/IMG_1204.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-738195&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 1537px) 100vw, 1537px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lalonde’s work, which includes jewelry, accessories, and apparel, is informed by her own interpretation of a “daydream utopia.” Her brand, &lt;a href=&quot;https://beepybella.world/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; aria-label=&quot;Beepy Bella (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;&gt;Beepy Bella&lt;/a&gt;, is known for weaving a love of science and the natural world with a sense of ethereal playfulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Lalonde teamed up with &lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt; and mushroom expert Bat Vardeh to bring mushrooms into the spotlight. A day spent hunting for fungi in the Angeles Forest in southern California inspired Lalonde to create the Mushroom Punk Ring, and &lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt; has created an informal foraging field guide to accompany it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;2049&quot; height=&quot;1537&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/IMG_1110.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-738198&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 2049px) 100vw, 2049px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On their day out together, Lalonde and Vardeh (along with Lalonde’s assistant Oliva Kormushoff and writer L.D.

&lt;div style=&quot;height:20px&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;wp-block-spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vardeh is the founder and president of Woman Forage SoCal, a group dedicated to creating a space for women-identifying individuals to engage with the world of fungi. Focusing on mushroom education and foraging expeditions, Women Forage SoCal is the only women’s group dedicated to such an endeavor. In fact, Vardeh started the collective for the very reason that there was not a mushroom group dedicated to female-identifying persons. Vardeh sought to create an accessible space where women could become as involved in the mushroom world as they wanted. She emphasizes that the collective is for both the hardcore mushroom enthusiast as well as those with a burgeoning or casual interest. The group is “open to every woman,” says Vardeh, “you can be anyone with any kind of relationship to nature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;2049&quot; height=&quot;1536&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/IMG_0974.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-738200&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 2049px) 100vw, 2049px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On their day of mushroom hunting, Vardeh first taught the group how to identify where fungi might be found, a skill Vardeh refers to as “mushroom vision.” Then the foursome climbed a mountain to an oak grove at the top, reading the landscape and learning about different fungi, plants, and animals along the way. Once they arrived at the oak grove, they continued to put their newfound knowledge to work, collecting and identifying mushrooms, and marveling at the symbiotic relationships between seemingly disparate aspects of nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After their day out, Vardeh and Lalonde spoke fondly of the time they spent together. Though they come from different fields and have different approaches to mushrooms as a whole, both women felt a real connection with each other that day, and with nature, with each connection informing the other. “Mushrooms unite people,” Vardeh reflected, “and there is a unitive power in being out in nature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;2049&quot; height=&quot;1536&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/IMG_1016.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-738203&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 2049px) 100vw, 2049px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ring Lalonde designed is her unique take on a mushroom species. Keeping in the tradition of her other work, this ring is a “souvenir” from her own fantasy world, informed by nature but fused with a sense of whimsy and play. Made by hand, the borosilicate glass ring is a hybrid of the imaginary and the real. The purple stem and yellow cap look almost like candy, an effect that plays on both the edible nature of many mushrooms, as well as a larger theme of synthetic tension that runs throughout the Beepy Bella catalog. Lalonde creates “childlike objects with sophisticated materials,” the combination of which sets up a relationship between curiosity and constraint. Sitting atop the mushroom ring’s cap is one of Lalonde’s signature emissaries, a ladybug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;1500&quot; height=&quot;1500&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/img_t_-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-738207&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This limited run of the &lt;em&gt;Nautilus&lt;/em&gt; x Beepy Bella Mushroom Punk Ring and foraging field guide bring together grounded science with a sense of creative wonder, reflecting a unique perspective on the natural world and its place in our lives and imaginations.
