&lt;p&gt;Tesla has faced&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/tesla-protests-surrey-1.7485259&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/tesla-protests-surrey-1.7485259&quot;&gt;numerous protests in Canada&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;recently due to owner Elon Musk&#39;s proximity to U.S. President Donald Trump, at a time when Trump has imposed&amp;nbsp;25 per cent tariffs on Canadian imports and publicly made threats of annexation towards the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car manufacturer has seen protests at its dealerships, and its products&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/tesla-products-bc-hydro-rebates-tariffs-1.7482501&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/tesla-products-bc-hydro-rebates-tariffs-1.7482501&quot;&gt;have been excluded&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;from B.C.&#39;s electric vehicle rebate programs amid the trade war with the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest development comes with the annual Vancouver International Auto Show deciding&amp;nbsp;to exclude Tesla after the&amp;nbsp;carmaker was given multiple opportunities to withdraw voluntarily, according to a statement from the show&#39;s executive director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The Vancouver Auto Show&#39;s primary concern is the safety of attendees, exhibitors, and staff,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; executive director Eric Nicholl said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;This decision will ensure all attendees can be solely focused on enjoying the many positive elements of the event.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a news conference, Nicholl said that Tesla was given the opportunity to voluntarily withdraw over the last week, and the carmaker was informed of the removal at 1 p.m. PT on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholl said, in response to a question from CBC News, that the concerns prompting the removal were &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;all-inclusive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; of the prospect of protests and vandalism against Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;[In] light of the recent escalating events throughout North America, as we&#39;re getting closer, we&#39;re seeing a spike,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; the expo director said, referring to protests over the last six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Making the decision at this point in time ensures that the safety of our guests and attendees is paramount.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WATCH | B.C. removes Tesla products from rebate programs:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesla products now excluded from B.C. Hydro rebates in response to U.S. tariffs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a response to U.S. tariffs, B.C. is targeting one of the president&#39;s closest allies. Starting Thursday, B.C. Hydro is removing Tesla products from its electric vehicle charger rebate program. CBC&#39;s Yvette Brend is on this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auto show is held every year at the Vancouver Convention Centre, and its website says it attracts over 100,000 attendees. It is operated by the New Car Dealers Association of B.C. It begins on Wednesday and will end on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement in February, the auto show said that it had record-setting attendance last year and had solidified itself as&amp;nbsp;Western Canada&#39;s best-attended consumer show and one of North America&#39;s premiere automotive exhibition events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Given U.S.-Canada relations, have you sold or tried to sell your Tesla? We want to hear from you. Send an email to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;mailto:ask@cbc.ca&quot; href=&quot;mailto:ask@cbc.ca&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ask@cbc.ca&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicholl said that political rumblings had no bearing on the decision to remove Tesla, which he said was disappointing for the expo, as it wanted to showcase the greatest breadth of automobiles available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It was a hard decision to land at,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:1--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicholl said&amp;nbsp;consumer auto shows are important to every car manufacturer, and no other participants have&amp;nbsp;been removed in the three years he&#39;s been running the show.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Hydro rebates in response to U.S. tariffs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tesla CEO close to Trump&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musk, Tesla&#39;s CEO, is a close confidant of Trump in his role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, which has implemented sweeping cuts to that&amp;nbsp;country&#39;s civil service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The billionaire&amp;nbsp;is a self-described &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;free speech absolutist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; who has faced criticism from hate-speech watchdogs for allowing extremist, dangerous and antisemitic comments to flourish on X, the social media platform that he owns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Tindall, a University of B.C. sociology professor, said that to the extent that Trump was a threat to Canada in people&#39;s eyes, Musk was part of the threat too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the billionaire CEO and his company have&amp;nbsp;become a popular target for protesters — the inverse of an earlier positive&amp;nbsp;perception of Musk as a man who was advancing clean energy and electric cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Tesla&#39;s kind of the low-hanging fruit, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he told CBC News. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It&#39;s kind of the low-hanging fruit in a mass protest that is going to ramp up against ... this whole administration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--body:attachment:2--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vancouver International Auto Show removes Tesla as exhibitor amid safety concerns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vancouver International Auto Show has removed Tesla from its event this week. As Meera Bains reports, the show’s executive director says the electric carmaker was asked to withdraw because the expo&#39;s &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;primary concern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; was for the safety of workers, exhibitors and those attending the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel&#39;s renewed ground operations come a day after more than&amp;nbsp;400 Palestinians&amp;nbsp;were killed in airstrikes in one of the deadliest episodes since the beginning of the conflict, shattering a ceasefire that has mostly held since January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israeli military said its operations have extended its control over the Netzarim Corridor, which bisects&amp;nbsp;Gaza, and were a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;focused&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; manoeuvre aimed at creating a partial buffer zone between the north and the south of the enclave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamas called the ground move a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;new and dangerous violation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; to the ceasefire deal, in a statement Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move comes as the United Nations said a foreign staffer was killed and five other workers were wounded in an Israeli airstrike Wednesday on the site of a UN&amp;nbsp;headquarters in central&amp;nbsp;Gaza&amp;nbsp;City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jorge Moreira da Silva, Executive Director of the UN&amp;nbsp;office for Project Services, said: &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Israel knew that this was a UN&amp;nbsp;premises, that people were living, staying and working there, it is a compound. It is a very well-known place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An explosive device was dropped or fired on the premises, he told a news conference in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;This was not an accident,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;What&#39;s happening in&amp;nbsp;Gaza&amp;nbsp;is unconscionable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Raed Hussein, director of emergency and ambulance services at Al-Aqsa Hospital in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah, called for protection of international organizations including the UN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;[The Israeli army] bombed a residential area. The [victims] are foreigners who entered the Gaza Strip,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Hussein told CBC News freelance videographer Mohamed El Saife&amp;nbsp;on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Israeli military denied it had struck the UN compound in Deir el-Balah. It said it had hit a Hamas site in northern Gaza where it had detected preparations for firing into Israeli territory but provided no evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel warned the onslaught was &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;just the beginning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Residents forced to evacuate homes in north, south&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the Israeli army dropped leaflets in the northern and southern&amp;nbsp;Gaza&amp;nbsp;Strip, ordering residents to evacuate their homes, warning they were in &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;dangerous combat zones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defence Minister Israel Katz issued a video statement warning&amp;nbsp;Gaza&amp;nbsp;residents that evacuation from combat zones would begin shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said airstrikes were &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;only the first step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; and if the hostages were not released, &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Israel will act with force you have not yet seen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israeli military attacks in Gaza will intensify, Netanyahu says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warning: This video contains graphic images | Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel’s military campaign will continue in Gaza with increasing intensity. The first wave of bombardments from Israel since the collapse of the ceasefire killed at least 400 people and displaced thousands from their homes, Gaza health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#39;s decision to resume bombardments has triggered protests in Israel as 59 hostages are still being held in Gaza, with 24 of them believed to be still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A coalition of hostage families and protesters against Netanyahu&#39;s moves against the judiciary and other parts of the security establishment has regrouped and accuses the prime minister of using the war for political ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu said on Tuesday that he had ordered strikes because Hamas had rejected proposals to secure an extension of the ceasefire until April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:1--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamas, which still holds 59 of about 250 hostages Israel says the group seized in its Oct.7, 2023, cross-border attack, accused Israel of jeopardizing efforts by mediators to negotiate a permanent deal to end the fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamas spokesperson Abdel-Latif Al-Qanoua told Reuters the closure of the Salahuddin Road was a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;total coup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; against the ceasefire agreement and a tightening of the blockade on&amp;nbsp;Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He renewed his group&#39;s interest in concluding the three-phased ceasefire agreement and would welcome any proposal &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;as long as it is based on launching negotiation on the second phase and a complete end to the war in&amp;nbsp;Gaza.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arab plan in jeopardy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arab nations&amp;nbsp;drew up a plan&amp;nbsp;for peace and reconstruction in&amp;nbsp;Gaza&amp;nbsp;after a proposal from U.S. President Donald Trump to resettle Palestinians and turn it into the &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Riviera&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the Middle East triggered outrage in the region. However, the plan has not gained traction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel and Western powers do not want the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas to play any role in the enclave when the war is over. Israel has vowed to crush Hamas, but the Palestinian militant group remains the dominant force in&amp;nbsp;Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest violence, local health workers said an Israeli airstrike killed four people and wounded 10 others in a house in the northern&amp;nbsp;Gaza&amp;nbsp;Strip town of Beit Hanoun, where the army renewed evacuation orders to residents earlier on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Beit Lahiya, a new Israeli airstrike killed 14 people at a mourning tent, medics said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--body:attachment:2--&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 400 people killed in overnight Israeli airstrikes, Palestinian officials say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli airstrikes pounded Gaza overnight, killing more than 400 people, Palestinian health authorities say, threatening the complete collapse of the two-month ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli naval vessels also attacked several boats, which Israel said intended to carry out &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;terrorist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; acts by Hamas and Islamic Jihad militant groups. Palestinians said an Israeli drone fired at several fishing boats onshore of&amp;nbsp;Gaza&amp;nbsp;City, setting several of them ablaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamas officials said they remained keen on concluding the three-phase ceasefire deal as signed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel and Hamas accuse each other of breaching the truce, which had offered a respite for&amp;nbsp;Gaza&#39;s 2.3 million residents after&amp;nbsp;17 months of war, which has reduced the enclave to rubble and displaced the majority of its population&amp;nbsp;multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, shattering Israel&#39;s reputation as invincible in a hostile region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subsequent Israeli campaign in&amp;nbsp;Gaza&amp;nbsp;has killed more than 49,000 people, say Palestinian health authorities, and caused a humanitarian crisis with shortages of food, fuel and water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spokesperson Charlotte MacLeod&amp;nbsp;told CBC News in an email that&amp;nbsp;Canada had &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;repeatedly called for clemency for these individuals at the senior-most levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said Canada &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;remains steadfast in its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all cases, everywhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacLeod said the federal department is continuing to provide consular assistance to the families of those who were executed, but would not provide the identities of the victims, or how many of them there were.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#39;s embassy in Ottawa defended the executions on Wednesday, telling CBC News in an email that &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;whoever violates the law of China must be held accountable in accordance with the law.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The embassy would not provide the names of the executed Canadians or the specific crimes they were alleged to have committed, beyond that they were&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;drug related.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also declined to say how many Canadians were killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;China always imposes severe penalties on drug-related crimes and maintains a &#39;zero-tolerance&#39; attitude toward&amp;nbsp;the drug problem,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; the embassy said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The facts of the crimes committed by the Canadian nationals involved in the cases are clear, and the evidence is solid and sufficient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The embassy said the cases were handled &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;in strict accordance with the law&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; and that the rights and interests of the Canadians were &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;fully guaranteed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#39;A clear, disturbing development&#39;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vina Nadjibulla, the vice-president of research and strategy at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, said the executions are&amp;nbsp;a &quot;deeply troubling development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The execution of foreigners is extremely rare even in the Chinese criminal justice system which has a 99 per cent conviction rate and carries out more executions than any other country in the world,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadjibulla said the last time China executed a foreign citizen was more than 10 years ago, and this decision by China, despite Canada&#39;s efforts to secure clemency through diplomatic means, suggests the two countries are still very far apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;For those people who were hoping that in the current climate China may wish to strengthen relations with Canada, may wish to deepen partnerships, this shows that that is really not the case,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;This is a clear, disturbing development in the bilateral relationship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Canada-China relations remain sour&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The embassy pushed back against Global Affairs Canada&#39;s condemnation of the executions and said Canada should accept the decisions made by China&#39;s judicial system if it wants to improve ties between the two countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We urge the Canadian side to respect the rule of law and China&#39;s judicial sovereignty, stop making irresponsible remarks, work in the same direction with China and jointly promote the improvement and development of China-Canada relations with concrete actions,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; the embassy said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relations between Canada and China have been strained since the December 2018 detention of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor by Beijing, on vague national security allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their arrests were widely seen as retaliation for the Vancouver arrest of Huawei&#39;s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, just days before,&amp;nbsp;at the behest of the U.S. to face fraud charges related to American sanctions against Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;|&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What could Canada have done better to help Michael Kovrig?:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;What could Canada have done better to help Michael Kovrig? | Canada Tonight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Kovrig, one of the &#39;Two Michaels&#39; held by China for more than 1,000 days, says Ottawa &#39;was not prepared’ for his detention. Margaret McCuaig-Johnston, a board member of the China Strategic Risks Institute, explains to Canada Tonight what the government could’ve done better. Guy Saint-Jacques, the former Canadian ambassador to China, also describes the conditions of Chinese detention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although all three were released in 2021, the two countries have continued to butt heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, China is expected to institute 100 per cent tariffs on Canadian canola, along with 25 per cent tariffs on other goods like seafood and pork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese tariffs come in response to Canada&#39;s 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles and a 25-per-cent levy on Chinese aluminum and steel products imposed on Oct. 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move was meant to keep cheap electric cars from China at bay to grow and protect Canada&#39;s nascent EV sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg was sentenced in November&amp;nbsp;2018 to a 15-year prison term in China over allegations of drug smuggling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2019, Canada reached out to China&#39;s ambassador to Canada to ask for clemency for&amp;nbsp;Schellenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But early that year, about a month after Meng&amp;nbsp;was detained, Schellenberg was retried and sentenced to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Canada continues to advocate for clemency for Robert Schellenberg and provides him and his family consular assistance,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; MacLeod said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krishan Jogia turned to an immigration consultancy before landing in Toronto in 2023, only to&amp;nbsp;realize later — after spending thousands of dollars — that he had been dealing with a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;ghost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; consultancy apparently operating illegally in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jogia, a dual Canadian-Australian citizen, sought the services of Canada Global Migration Consultants (GMC) for a Canadian visitor visa for his wife, Luana Cabral de Carvalho. They eventually&amp;nbsp;received it, but things didn&#39;t go as smoothly when they tried again for her spousal visa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/newsinteractives/features/the-cost-of-the-canadian-dream&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/newsinteractives/features/the-cost-of-the-canadian-dream&quot;&gt;Welcome to CanadaIs it worth immigrating to Canada? These newcomers say it comes at a cost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/immigration-consultants-lawyers-potential-risks-1.7423712&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/immigration-consultants-lawyers-potential-risks-1.7423712&quot;&gt;In DepthRegulator taking too long to rule on &#39;bad actor&#39; immigration consultants, critics say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Canada GMC visually, like if you&#39;ve seen their YouTube, Instagram and website, comes off as very polished,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Jogia said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;When you call them, you get a proper help desk with hold music and everything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in early 2024, Jogia said, their consultant&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;just disappeared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; For months, he said, the consultancy kept ignoring them and shuffled them around to different colleagues. The two were able to get hold of that consultant, who is a registered immigration consultant,&amp;nbsp;directly.&amp;nbsp;He&amp;nbsp;told them, in an email seen by CBC News, that they left Canada GMC due to &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;their unethical work practices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We started really aggressively trying to pursue a refund, and that&#39;s when they just stopped replying and just ignored us,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Jogia&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#39;s name does not appear on the list of immigration consultancies&amp;nbsp;permitted to operate in Canada, contrary to the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the body that regulates the profession,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants (CICC),&amp;nbsp;said immigration consultants&amp;nbsp;must only provide services&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;under a business name that is registered with the college and appears on the public register.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Jogia said, the couple paid roughly $12,000 to Canada GMC and consulted a lawyer to take action against the company, which &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;ignored the demand letter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The couple filed a complaint with the CICC about their experience with Canada GMC. Even approaching the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre and Better Business Bureau hasn&#39;t remedied anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I mean, it&#39;s disappointing. It doesn&#39;t even sum it up right. It&#39;s surprising how unregulated the industry is and just the lack of desire to do anything about it,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Jogia said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why newcomers may use&amp;nbsp;consultants over lawyers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say newcomers prefer consultants to lawyers for their immigration paperwork and applications because they&#39;re more affordable. But there are calls for more scrutiny and enforcement by&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;CICC&amp;nbsp;to penalize those operating without a licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlicensed individuals acting as licensed consultants are known as ghost consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new survey commissioned by CBC News has found more newcomers are choosing immigration consultants over lawyers, but they have concerns about oversight of both professions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/newsinteractives/features/immigration-survey&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/newsinteractives/features/immigration-survey&quot;&gt;Welcome to CanadaNewcomers feel Canada accepts &#39;too many immigrants&#39; without proper planning, CBC survey finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/investigates/jeanett-moskito-link4staff-berderald-consulting-investigation-1.7416570&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/investigates/jeanett-moskito-link4staff-berderald-consulting-investigation-1.7416570&quot;&gt;CBC InvestigatesThis recruiter has allegedly scammed &#39;hundreds&#39; of Filipino migrant workers. Some are now homeless&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey, conducted by market research firm Pollara in November 2024, asked 1,507 people who arrived in Canada in the past 10 years about their immigration experiences and found 33 per cent of those surveyed used consultants, while 16 per cent used lawyers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, 89 per cent also said Canada needs to do a better job with regulating consultants and lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A national survey of that size would normally have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Canada GMC and who owns it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its website, Canada GMC advertises having a team of Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultants (RCIC), but neither the&amp;nbsp;company nor most of the staff the couple&amp;nbsp;interacted with can be found&amp;nbsp;on the public register of those certified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seemingly multinational entity is owned by a company in Israel called Media Bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canada GMC website is owned and operated by a private company, WorldMigration Unipessoal LDA, which is based in Portugal and runs similar businesses for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.ukgvs.com/about-us/&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ukgvs.com/about-us/&quot;&gt;U.K&lt;/a&gt;. and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.icaustralia.com/about-us/&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icaustralia.com/about-us/&quot;&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Canada, the consultancy lists a downtown Ottawa address on its website. CBC reached out to the building operator, who confirmed no consultancy of that name ever ran its businesses there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York state resident Lorre Denise Schneer said&amp;nbsp;she too&amp;nbsp;fell prey to Canada GMC.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schneer and her family were trying to immigrate to Canada as permanent residents. As a new mother, she paid Canada GMC $5,260 US&amp;nbsp;to handle her application, only to realize one wasn&#39;t submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/investigates/alleged-payroll-cycling-turtle-jacks-oakville-1.7367359&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/investigates/alleged-payroll-cycling-turtle-jacks-oakville-1.7367359&quot;&gt;CBC InvestigatesThis foreign worker says he paid his own wages for a cook position that didn&#39;t exist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/investigates/cbc-ijf-lmia-ads-investigation-1.7350596&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/investigates/cbc-ijf-lmia-ads-investigation-1.7350596&quot;&gt;CBC InvestigatesOnline ads illegally sell jobs to temporary foreign workers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Jogia, Schneer and her family have tried all avenues to remedy the situation but to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I was so excited about Canada … but knowing that a country is allowing a business like this to operate and there&#39;s no ramifications for it, that gives me such a bad taste because this should never be allowed to happen, because even the smartest of individuals can fall prey to something like this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s far from the only operation of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Social media drive&amp;nbsp;&#39;misinformation:&#39; licensed consultant&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the border city of Windsor, Ont., experts say ghost consultants are a rising problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H&amp;amp;S operates in an unmarked industrial building in a trucking parking lot by Sandwich Street, walking distance from the Gordie Howe International Bridge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;At H&amp;amp;S Immigration, we&#39;re not just your typical immigration consultants —&amp;nbsp;we&#39;re your partners in realizing your dreams,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; reads their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;As a result of our unwavering commitment and high approval rates, we&#39;ve proudly risen to become one of the leading immigration consultancies in North India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling itself a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;trusted partner,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;the consultancy, which has been around for eight years, has two overseas branches in Punjab, India,&amp;nbsp;a top country of origin for newcomers to Canada. But, like Canada GMC, it is not licensed and did not respond to multiple CBC requests.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:1--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hussein Zarif, executive director at Canada By Choice, an immigration consultancy, said the presence of unlicensed consultants is &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;very unfortunate but not surprising.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zarif said a majority of Canada By Choice&#39;s clients have been approached by fraudulent consultants promising them pathways to a permanent future in Canada, resulting in many &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;coming with tears&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; after being defrauded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The people that are affected are the most vulnerable people. It is a rising problem,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It hurts us licensed immigration consultants too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/lmia-points-removed-1.7415467&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/lmia-points-removed-1.7415467&quot;&gt;Federal government to remove incentive for foreign workers to reduce fraud in immigration system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/centre-for-newcomers-immigrants-hostility-1.7424453&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/centre-for-newcomers-immigrants-hostility-1.7424453&quot;&gt;Welcome to CanadaImmigrants facing more hostility, says Calgary&#39;s Centre for Newcomers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, it&#39;s recent newcomers who aren&#39;t aware of the legal systems&amp;nbsp;and who fall prey to fraudulent consultants, Zarif said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From illegally selling job offers to helping bypass immigration requirements, these &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;warning signs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; should alert newcomers of ghost consultants who often don&#39;t even submit applications, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Education is a huge part of the solution of educating immigrants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is more profound online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media like Instagram and YouTube are filled with pages and channels offering immigration advice&amp;nbsp;— many call&amp;nbsp;themselves educational consultants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zarif said many clients walk in with false information they learned&amp;nbsp;from social media consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;All that misinformation at the end of the day is going to lead people in desperate situations to take desperate actions rather than coming to a professional.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;College reviewing reports of fake consultants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becoming a Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultant involves completing an entry-to-practice exam and successful completion of a graduate diploma program through Queen&#39;s University in Kingston, Ont., or the University of Montreal. The schools say interest in these programs is growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CICC, there are 11,999 licensees in Canada, with 5,586 of them based in Ontario and&amp;nbsp;the majority in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulatory college said it has received 682 reports of unauthorized practitioners (UAP) since its inception in 2021. Of those, 289 remain open and are being reviewed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Additionally, we have taken down more than 5,000 UAP social media pages and websites in the last year,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; the college said, noting it cannot hold them accountable for their actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lack of immigration lawyers adds to the problem&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her more than three decades of experience of working with newcomers, Shelley Gilbert, executive director of Legal Assistance of Windsor, has seen the threat of ghost consultants first hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with recent immigration changes and the path to remain in Canada on a permanent basis becoming more difficult, Gilbert said there are &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;more and more people desperate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;That gave an opportunity for unscrupulous people to take advantage of all of that desperation that we&#39;re seeing here now. The numbers [of such consultants] have likely gone up because they prey on that,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As recent newcomers find different avenues to remain, the bad actors, Gilbert said, continue to exploit applicants by offering pathways that don&#39;t exist. She said part of her organization&#39;s job is to provide accurate information and education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;One of the difficulties that we have in Windsor and Essex County is a lack of immigration lawyers,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she said, paving the way for consultants to bridge&amp;nbsp;that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/international-students-worry-about-windsor-essex-s-highest-jobless-rate-1.7423499&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/international-students-worry-about-windsor-essex-s-highest-jobless-rate-1.7423499&quot;&gt;These international students are trying to find jobs. But a tight job market leaves them with few options&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/international-students-college-university-fields-study-data-1.7195530&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/international-students-college-university-fields-study-data-1.7195530&quot;&gt;CBC InvestigatesCanada&#39;s foreign student push &#39;mismatched&#39; job market, data shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilbert advises asking for references and getting second opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It&#39;s hard to do because very often, exploitive consultants will also make people feel bad for asking questions, for questioning their authority. That should also be a red flag for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Legal recourse also limited: immigration lawyer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Koltun, an immigration lawyer in Ontario&#39;s Niagara Region, is calling for changes to the Immigration Refugee Protection Act to protect people who fall victim to scams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Court has determined that if you use a representative in your immigration claims, you are responsible for their actions, including any misrepresentation, Koltun said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In effect, then, if you want to try to hold a scam consultant legally accountable, you&#39;re effectively revealing you&#39;ve committed misrepresentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;That would then likely lead to your deportation from Canada,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;So, there&#39;s that big fear. That means if you take action against someone who has really scammed you, it will lead to your removal from Canada, which is the opposite of what you want.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that general fear of deportation, Koltun said, fraudulent consultants threaten reporting such clients to authorities if they want to pursue any legal action against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are going to be &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;collateral consequences of trying to seek justice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the uncertainty about the availability and age of the various fleets of aircraft is expected to grow in light of the Liberal government&#39;s pledge to look at alternatives to the F-35 fighters and the possibility that the number of U.S.-made warplanes on order could be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document, dated Feb. 18, 2025, tracks the availability of military equipment and personnel. It projects that 60 per cent of the air force inventory is &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;unserviceable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; and likely not fit for deployment should NATO call upon this country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of reducing the number of U.S.-built F-35s — as much as it may feel good politically and play well among an angry public — comes at an extremely vulnerable time for Canada&#39;s air force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of its combat capability is made up of aging CF-18 fighter jets, which governments of both political stripes have hesitated in replacing — mostly for political reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former Conservative government&#39;s plan to buy F-35s ran into a storm of political, public and watchdog criticism — so much so that the current Liberal government rode to power in an election a decade ago on a promise not to buy the Lockheed Martin-manufactured jet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An open competition and eight years later, the Liberals reversed themselves and ordered 88 fighters to replace the current CF-18s, some of which are closing in on 45 years of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter President Donald Trump&#39;s annexation threats and the bruising trade war which he initiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The F-35 has long been a political football in Canada, and seems destined to be one again as Prime Minister Mark Carney is expected to call a federal election and seek a mandate from a public that&#39;s growing increasingly alarmed about the country&#39;s state of defence preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The defence minister raised the issue with me,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Carney said recently in explaining his decision to order a review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue, says Carney, is whether the F-35 is the right warplane for Canada in this geopolitical climate when allies are questioning the reliability of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/cf-18-hornets-1.1003648&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/cf-18-hornets-1.1003648&quot;&gt;In DepthA history of Canada&#39;s CF-18 Hornets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We had a discussion about Canada&#39;s options and the fact is that under the [F-35] contract, as you may know, there are — after a certain number of purchases — we have options on subsequent aircraft,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; the prime minister said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada has already paid for its first tranche of 16 F-35s, to be delivered in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It planned to buy 88 in total from Lockheed Martin for $19 billion, but that could change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Defence Minister Bill Blair floated the idea that the air force could have two types of fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The Prime Minister has asked me to go and examine those things and have discussions with other sources, particularly where there may be opportunities to assemble those fighter jets in Canada,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Blair told host David Cochrane on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://gem.cbc.ca/power-politics&quot; href=&quot;https://gem.cbc.ca/power-politics&quot;&gt;CBC&#39;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://gem.cbc.ca/power-politics&quot; href=&quot;https://gem.cbc.ca/power-politics&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power &amp;amp; Politics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/f35-blair-trump-1.7484477&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/f35-blair-trump-1.7484477&quot;&gt;Canada reconsidering F-35 purchase amid tensions with Washington, says minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/f35-pbo-74-billion-1.7016178&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/f35-pbo-74-billion-1.7016178&quot;&gt;F-35 fighter jets to cost Canada nearly $74 billion: PBO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an obvious reference to the company that placed second in Canada&#39;s fighter jet competition — Saab, the Swedish defence giant. It offered its Gripen-E fighter jet and proposed assembling it in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, however, many obstacles to the Liberal government&#39;s proposal, starting with the age of the CF-18s. While their lifespan and electronics have been extended on a couple of occasions, the warplanes will become more unserviceable by 2032.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I understand why this discussion regarding the F-35 is underway and what I would say is this is the wrong weapon system to reconsider,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said retired general Tom Lawson, the country&#39;s former top military commander and a former consultant for Lockheed Martin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;There&#39;s a very real scenario where everything gets delayed to the point where there are no fighters flying in Canada for a period of time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawson also said operating two types of fighters is something the air force doesn&#39;t want to do because of the enormous cost of setting up two training and supply systems, as well as building separate hangars and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New concerns over buying American&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan Grazier, a senior fellow and program director at the Washington-based Stimson Center, said Canada has reasons to reconsider the F-35 beyond the current trade war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I certainly do understand the Canadian people&#39;s reluctance to fully participate in this program,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;There are some valid concerns about the F-35 program,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Grazier, who pointed to the ability of the U.S. to potentially influence the supply chain and software updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he believes Lockheed Martin has too much hold over proprietary information related to the aircraft to the detriment of not only allies, but the U.S. military as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I think all the partner countries for the F-35 program are taking a bit of a risk by participating in the program, just with the way that the program is structured and the way that it&#39;s supported specifically,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Grazier said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But former F-35 test pilot and retired lieutenant-colonel Billie Flynn says the same could be said about all U.S. military software and weapons supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Remember that every missile that we own and fire on the CF-18s and all our frigates, all our offensive weapons are American and necessarily the United States government has control over what&#39;s loaded into the latest version,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Flynn said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;In that sense, we&#39;re always at the mercy or vulnerable to what the United States government would do. We don&#39;t have war stocks to sustain a fight, and they would just shut the tap off against them or against anybody else. There is nothing unique about the vulnerability of the F-35.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to an order-in-council dated March 12, two days before Trudeau resigned, banks won&#39;t be allowed to charge more than $10 if someone doesn&#39;t have enough money in their personal accounts to cover a cheque or a pre-authorized debit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most banks charge non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees of $45 to $48 per transaction if an account holder does not have&amp;nbsp;overdraft protection, which typically comes with its own monthly fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks will also be prohibited from charging NSF fees more than once within a period of two business days and in cases where the overdraft is less than $10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid bank account holders accidentally incurring an NSF charge, banks will also have to send an alert giving account holders at least three-hours&#39; notice that a&amp;nbsp;payment exceeds their bank balance. If the account holder deposits money&amp;nbsp;to cover the payment within that period, banks cannot&amp;nbsp;charge the fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new regulations will apply to personal and joint accounts but not to corporate or business accounts. They will go into effect on March 12, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government predicts the measure will reduce NSF fees charged by Canadian banks by $4.1 billion over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finance Department spokesperson Marie-France Faucher said the order comes at the end of a process that began with a news release in 2023 as well as announcements in the 2024 budget and the government&#39;s 2024 fall economic statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;This work included extensive consultations with consumer groups and banks to ensure that the regulations provided sufficient protection for consumers while being technically feasible to implement,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Faucher wrote in an emailed response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Banking Association, which defended NSF fees to the government, says its members will comply with the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Now that the NSF fee regulations have been finalized by the Department of Finance, banks&#39; efforts will be focused on making the requisite system and process changes to comply,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Maggie Cheung, media relations manager for the association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheung said charging fees for payments that exceed bank balances helps Canada&#39;s banking system and there are ways to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;NSF&amp;nbsp;fees encourage responsible banking behaviour and help maintain the integrity of the payment system,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she wrote in an emailed response. &quot;To avoid these fees, customers can regularly monitor their account balances, set up balance alerts and consider overdraft protection services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alejandra Ruiz Vargas, president of ACORN Canada, which has argued that NSF fees disproportionately hit low-income Canadians, was thrilled the government had finally acted on its promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We&#39;re over the moon,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;This is something that we have been working for so long and so hard. Finally, the government has heeded our concerns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vargas said even if someone is only $5 short&amp;nbsp;to pay a bill or cover a cheque, they can get hit with a fee as high as $48 — money that they could have used for groceries or medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It is a window of hope for people,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she said of the change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vargas said ACORN would have liked the government to&amp;nbsp;ban NSF fees, and have the change take effect faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in a 24-page regulatory impact assessment sent to ACORN, the Finance Department says it chose a $10 cap for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/banks-upselling-go-public-1.4023575&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/banks-upselling-go-public-1.4023575&quot;&gt;GO PUBLIC&#39;We are all doing it&#39;: Employees at Canada&#39;s 5 big banks speak out about pressure to dupe customers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;A cap of $10 was chosen to balance the need to protect consumers from high fees with the need to maintain the integrity of the payments system by incentivizing consumers to honour their payments,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; the department wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finance Department estimates Canadian banks charged fees on 15.8 million NSF transactions in 2023, hitting an estimated 34 per cent of Canadians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assessment says NSF fees&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;represent a source of financial hardship for consumers. These fees disproportionately harm low-income Canadians and contribute to cycles of debt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said those fees can quickly pile up &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;as a result of multiple declined payments,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; and that the new regulations &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;will likely disproportionately benefit women, lone parent families, recent immigrants and Indigenous Peoples.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some banks offer a grace period, flexibility or overdraft protection for an account holder to cover the payment, not all customers are granted overdraft protection, the assessment points out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finance Department says the new regulations will apply to 79 financial institutions across Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the new regulations are to be published in the Canada Gazette on March 26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, Tim Hortons rightfully earned its place as a Canadian icon, starting with one coffee shop in Ontario and eventually building an empire that made Timbits and double doubles part of the national lexicon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after the company was bought by U.S. burger chain Wendy&#39;s, and later&amp;nbsp;became part of a holding company backed by a Brazilian investment firm, did it forfeit its claim to Canadian identity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic has been hotly debated online — and likely in coffee shops across the nation — in the wake of the patriotic fervour whipped up by tariff and annexation threats from U.S. President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent social media post from the company declares it to be &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;proudly Canadian,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; but many of the 2,500 comments below dispute the statement, insisting it is not Canadian, but rather American or Brazilian. Posts about the topic in &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Buy Canadian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; groups on social media sites have devolved into the same debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does the truth lie? What makes a company Canadian? Is it the&amp;nbsp;ownership? The supply chain? The franchise locations? The employees? The headquarters? Or is it something more intangible — a reflection of our values, history or traditions?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Origin and ownership&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, let&#39;s look at the hard facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Hortons was founded in 1964 by longtime Toronto Maple Leafs player Tim Horton, and was later taken over by Nova Scotia-born Ron Joyce after Horton&#39;s death in 1974.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1995, the business was bought by American burger chain Wendy&#39;s, but the two companies went their separate ways in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Tim Hortons became part of Restaurant Brands International. This is where the idea of Tim&#39;s being Brazilian comes from. Restaurant Brands International&#39;s largest shareholder was&amp;nbsp;the Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, at the time of the takeover, 3G held 47 per cent&amp;nbsp;of the voting power in Restaurant Brands International, but that has slowly decreased over time&amp;nbsp;to 26&amp;nbsp;per cent&amp;nbsp;as of Dec. 31, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 6,043 Tim Hortons stores worldwide, 64 per cent are located in Canada. More than 100,000 people are employed in the Canadian stores, which are owned by 1,500 franchisees. An additional 400 people work for the corporate office, which is headquartered in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Restaurant Brands International trade&amp;nbsp;on the Toronto Stock Exchange as well as the New York Stock Exchange, and the company is&amp;nbsp;regulated under the Canada Business Corporations Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of its supply chain, Tim Hortons roasts the majority of the coffee for its restaurants and blends the beans for its take-home coffee at two roasting facilities&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;its flagship roastery in Ancaster, Ont., and another in Rochester, N.Y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company owns five&amp;nbsp;distribution centres in Canada and uses third-party partners for four others in the country, and operates a&amp;nbsp;manufacturing plant&amp;nbsp;in Oakville, Ont., which produces fondants, icings and fills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muenkel says someone deciding&amp;nbsp;whether a company is Canadian might&amp;nbsp;consider where its sales come from, where it produces its goods,&amp;nbsp;where it employs people and, to an extent, who owns it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in his view, is Tim Hortons&amp;nbsp;Canadian? He hesitates, reluctant. Then:&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;As an economist, I would say yes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#39;Canadian in spirit&#39;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Douglas Hunter is the author of a book about Tim Hortons called&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Double Double: How Tim Hortons Became a Canadian Way of Life, One Cup at a Time&lt;/em&gt;. He&#39;s also written a book about Tim Horton, the man who started it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunter says in the company&#39;s earlier days, its sheer ubiquity was what made it popular with Canadians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;You want a coffee … you just point your car down one of the major roads and you&#39;re going to hit a Tim&#39;s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there just wasn&#39;t much competition at that time. Hunter says for people who wanted to run any kind of restaurant franchise, coffee and baked goods were way down the desirability list — below burgers, ice cream and pancakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It was the only show in town.… Ron Joyce with Horton figured out they had a&amp;nbsp;very strong niche that nobody&amp;nbsp;else was in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restaurants also became a gathering point in communities. If you needed to meet a stranger or sign divorce papers, a coffee shop was the place to do it, Hunter says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the company&#39;s multinational status today, Hunter says the fact that franchises are run by&amp;nbsp;local people who know their customers and the market &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;better than bean counters in&amp;nbsp;head office&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; sways his opinion in favour of Tim Hortons&#39;s identity as Canadian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I think it&#39;s Canadian in spirit,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he says. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Somebody in Sao Paulo is not sitting at a computer desk deciding, you know, how many crullers we&#39;re going to order.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#39;A place of community&#39;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person who is, in fact, deciding how many crullers to order — at least in the case of her own Tim Hortons franchises — is Tanya Doucette and her staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doucette lives in Sylvan Lake, Alta., and owns eight Tim Hortons locations in central Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says she hears the debates about whether Tim Hortons is Canadian, and she understands why Canadians want clarity during this moment of change and upheaval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in her mind, there&#39;s no question:&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Tim Hortons is Canadian.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:1--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the questions of stockholders and supply chains, Doucette says it&#39;s the role that Tim Hortons plays in the lives of ordinary people that earns its status as Canadian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She thinks back to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, when customers weren&#39;t allowed inside restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Our guests would bring lawn chairs and they would sit, even though it was winter … and even though Alberta can remain quite cold until well into May, our guests were gathering outside. They were keeping the spacing that was required, but they gathered outside because they needed that place to come together. And this is a&amp;nbsp;place of community for them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restaurant is so integral to some daily customers&#39; lives that they inform staff if they&#39;re going on holiday&amp;nbsp;and tell them not to worry if they&#39;re not around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doucette says when communities are celebrating something or dealing with tragedy, &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;we&#39;re one of the first calls — can you bring coffee? Can you provide Timbits or hot chocolate?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It&#39;s bonspiels, it&#39;s middle school orientations, it&#39;s read-a-thons, it&#39;s all the little ways that we try to support our communities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oliveira, the Tim Hortons communications director, said the company is deeply embedded in Canadian communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Hortons charitable programs raised $44.1 million in 2024 to support local causes through campaigns such as Smile Cookie, Camp Day, Orange Sprinkle doughnuts and Special Olympics doughnuts. It also runs seven camps for youth from low-income homes, and supports programs such as Timbits soccer and hockey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We don&#39;t just serve Canadians — we give back in a big way,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; says Oliveira.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s part of the reason why the chef and owner of Raven Rising-Global Indigenous Chocolates has decided to close her business&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;the other reasons including&amp;nbsp;the recent&amp;nbsp;Canada Post strike that delayed shipments, the threat of tariffs from the United States and a staffing shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Last year, chocolate pricing rose, for us, 90 per cent over the course of the year,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Maki said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The last 45 per cent of that was right before our busiest time. Forty-five per cent is no small feat for a small business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maki, who ran her business&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;White Bear First Nation, about 215 kilometres southeast of Regina, said&amp;nbsp;before deciding to close, she&amp;nbsp;considered&amp;nbsp;making her products smaller to reduce the rising costs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;If I lower a chocolate bar by 10 grams in order to help me have some sort of profit margin, then that&#39;s what I have to do,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Pricing will only bear what the consumer is willing to pay for your product.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because people don&#39;t consider chocolate a necessity, Maki&amp;nbsp;says, the rising prices cost her customers, including corporate clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price hike is due to a shortage of cocoa from farms in major cocoa-producing countries in West Africa. A series of climate disasters, including floods and drought,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/chocolate-prices-rising-drought-sugar-1.7155045&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/chocolate-prices-rising-drought-sugar-1.7155045&quot;&gt;have ruined crops in recent years.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to United Kingdom charity Christian Aid, cocoa prices have risen&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://mediacentre.christianaid.org.uk/cocoa-crisis-climate-change-threat-to-chocolate-laid-bare-in-new-report-ahead-of-valentines-day/&quot; href=&quot;https://mediacentre.christianaid.org.uk/cocoa-crisis-climate-change-threat-to-chocolate-laid-bare-in-new-report-ahead-of-valentines-day/&quot;&gt;400 per cent in recent years&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graham Gordon, Christian Aid&#39;s head of global advocacy and policy, says the disasters can be attributed to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;They&#39;re more extreme and they&#39;re more frequent due to climate change, even though you can&#39;t attribute, necessarily, a single event due to climate change,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Gordon said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;But these have been tracked over the last 10 or 20 years and you can see the increase in intensity and frequency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Better sustainability practices needed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophia Carodenuto, an associate professor of geography at the University of Victoria, says this year&#39;s cocoa harvest is expected to be somewhat back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she said most cocoa farms are small-scale operations and most profits from chocolates&amp;nbsp;don&#39;t usually&amp;nbsp;reach farmers themselves, preventing them from having the resources to adapt&amp;nbsp;to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh fudge! Chocolate prices on the rise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;One expert says the cost of the sweet treat has been soaring over the last year for large producers and it&#39;s expected to keep climbing in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;They are not able to invest in their farms to regenerate their [cocoa] trees, have more productive trees that are planted, or fight the disease and viruses that are affecting the tree,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Carodenuto said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says cocoa farming itself contributes to climate change through&amp;nbsp;deforestation&amp;nbsp;— which can&amp;nbsp;change&amp;nbsp;rainfall patterns&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;degrading soil through the&amp;nbsp;use of pesticides and fertilizers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We&#39;re seeing that the land is really unable to continue to produce at the rate that we&#39;ve seen in the past,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carodenuto&amp;nbsp;and some of her students recently took a trip to Belize, another cocoa-producing country, to see the effects of recent&amp;nbsp;wildfires. They noticed how crops protected by the shade of trees were spared from the flames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We&#39;re hoping that through awareness raising and planting&amp;nbsp;more[non-cocoa]&amp;nbsp;trees on farms,&amp;nbsp;that can lead to a more sustainable approach to [cocoa] production,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sask.&amp;nbsp;climate affects chocolate production&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faye Moffatt has also seen similar cocoa&amp;nbsp;price increases at her shop,&amp;nbsp;River Layne&amp;nbsp;Chocolate Couture,&amp;nbsp;in Saskatoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/chocolate-shop-art-1.7479637&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/chocolate-shop-art-1.7479637&quot;&gt;Saskatoon BitesThis former financial analyst quit number crunching for full-time chocolate artistry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;In 2023, it was about $3,300&amp;nbsp;a tonne and now it&#39;s up to about $10,000&amp;nbsp;to $12,000&amp;nbsp;a tonne,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Moffatt said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moffatt says&amp;nbsp;Saskatchewan poses its own climate challenges for her work. Increasingly hot summer days can cause her chocolate confections to melt, especially when they are being shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/saskatoon-pharmacist-makes-luxury-chocolate-bars-1.7390626&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/saskatoon-pharmacist-makes-luxury-chocolate-bars-1.7390626&quot;&gt;This Saskatoon pharmacist makes $100 luxury chocolate bars in her garage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;On weeks where it&#39;s in the highs 20s or 30s C&amp;nbsp;we tend to not ship our chocolate, unless our client really wants it&amp;nbsp;and we&#39;ll put ice packs in,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Moffatt said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;But there are definitely times where we just have to slow our shipping.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Moffatt and Maki&amp;nbsp;say&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;hot&amp;nbsp;temperatures are&amp;nbsp;extending further&amp;nbsp;into spring and fall, meaning ice packs and air conditioning have to be used more frequently, driving up costs further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moffatt&amp;nbsp;says even though cocoa can&#39;t be produced in Canada, she&#39;s trying to buy equipment and other items for her shop locally&amp;nbsp;to support the Canadian economy, while&amp;nbsp;hopefully saving some money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maki says she is working on diversifying her business to offer more than just&amp;nbsp;chocolate, and is in the process of figuring out a launch date.&lt;/p&gt;

But what&#39;s even more depressing is what might appear in next year&#39;s edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or rather, what might not appear in the&amp;nbsp;2026 volume: an old democracy, by some measures the world&#39;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/stories/2019/08/countries-are-the-worlds-oldest-democracies/&quot; href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/stories/2019/08/countries-are-the-worlds-oldest-democracies/&quot;&gt;oldest&lt;/a&gt;;&amp;nbsp;a superpower that long&amp;nbsp;circled the globe professing to spread freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;If it continues like this, the United States will not score as a democracy when we release [next year&#39;s] data,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Staffan Lindberg, head of the Varieties of Democracy&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.v-dem.net/&quot; href=&quot;https://www.v-dem.net/&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt;, run out of Sweden&#39;s University of Gothenburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;If it continues like this, democracy [there] will not last another six months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His project includes 31 million data points for 202 counties, compiled by 4,200 scholars and other contributors, measuring 600 different attributes of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindberg&amp;nbsp;happens to be in the U.S. this week presenting this year&#39;s report — which only includes data through the end of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some grim milestones were breached this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of autocracies (91) has just surpassed democracies (88) on this list for the first time in two decades, and nearly three-quarters of humans now live in an autocracy —&amp;nbsp;where one person has unconstrained&amp;nbsp;power —&amp;nbsp;the highest rate in five decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest report finds Canada and the U.S. in the &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Electoral Democracy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; tier, the second-highest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report adds an important caveat: this year&#39;s version only includes details through&amp;nbsp;2024, meaning it does not cover&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-courts-guardrails-analysis-1.7457725&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-courts-guardrails-analysis-1.7457725&quot;&gt;the start of&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Donald Trump&#39;s latest presidential term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few days alone, Trump has smashed past several new milestones.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s just called his predecessor&#39;s pardons&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-claims-biden-pardons-void-alleging-were-signed-via-autopen&quot; href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-claims-biden-pardons-void-alleging-were-signed-via-autopen&quot;&gt;void and vacated&lt;/a&gt;.

And, most importantly, when that deportation plan wound up in court, he may have — although it&#39;s still in dispute —&amp;nbsp;defied a court order, cracking the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-courts-guardrails-analysis-1.7457725&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-courts-guardrails-analysis-1.7457725&quot;&gt;ultimate constitutional safeguard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not just the scope of what Trump&#39;s done that has Lindberg&amp;nbsp;envisioning the once-unthinkable: removing the U.S. from the democratic list and shifting it to the second-lowest tier among&amp;nbsp;five, to a so-called electoral autocracy.&amp;nbsp;It&#39;s also the speed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Like Erdoğan,&amp;nbsp;Orbán, Modi&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;only faster&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lindberg said Trump is doing many of the same things as Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey, Viktor Orbán in Hungary&amp;nbsp;and Narendra Modi in India — only faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It&#39;s the pace,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Lindberg&amp;nbsp;said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;He&#39;s trying to do in a few months what it took them eight to 10 years to achieve.… It&#39;s very dire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could happen&amp;nbsp;next? Watch the courts, he says. Their actions, and Trump&#39;s response, are fundamental. In the&amp;nbsp;countries that halted an authoritarian slide, he said, courts played a key role, citing Poland, Brazil, North Macedonia and Zambia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, a number of Americans might find his assessment controversial — offensive, even. But some of his U.S. peers readily concur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pardoned Jan. 6 rioters released from prison&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than 24 hours after being pardoned by U.S. President Donald Trump, some of the convicted Jan. 6 rioters were released from prison. On his first day in office, Trump pardoned roughly 1,600 offenders and commuted the sentences of more than a dozen people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;This is what electoral autocracy looks like,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Michael Miller, a professor at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., who specializes in democratic erosion and runs a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/05/23/a-new-expert-survey-finds-warning-signs-for-the-state-of-american-democracy/&quot; href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/05/23/a-new-expert-survey-finds-warning-signs-for-the-state-of-american-democracy/&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://mediarelations.gwu.edu/american-democracy-really-risk-new-gw-project-quantifies-threats-system&quot; href=&quot;https://mediarelations.gwu.edu/american-democracy-really-risk-new-gw-project-quantifies-threats-system&quot;&gt;experts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Electoral autocracy, or a weak democracy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That remains true even if Trump won an election, fair and square. Miller said most autocracies indeed have multi-party elections — approximately three-quarters of them, unlike the remainder in the most stifling category, the closed autocracy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is an &#39;electoral autocracy&#39;?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an electoral autocracy, you can vote, you can protest, you can criticize the government — but at a price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That price, Miller&amp;nbsp;said, is the fear of retaliation: losing your job, public funding&amp;nbsp;or a contract. Over time, fear takes hold, and people — including&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-applauds-jeff-bezos-changes-washington-post-rare-media-praise&quot; href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-applauds-jeff-bezos-changes-washington-post-rare-media-praise&quot;&gt;powerful media owners&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;— start to self-censor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller sees an almost perfect replica here of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/hungarys-orban-vows-fast-crackdown-media-ngos-over-foreign-funding-2025-03-15/&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/hungarys-orban-vows-fast-crackdown-media-ngos-over-foreign-funding-2025-03-15/&quot;&gt;moves&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/hungarys-orban-vows-fast-crackdown-media-ngos-over-foreign-funding-2025-03-15/&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/hungarys-orban-vows-fast-crackdown-media-ngos-over-foreign-funding-2025-03-15/&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;modern&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://rsf.org/en/t%C3%BCrkiye-ten-years-state-hostility-towards-press-under-president-erdogan&quot; href=&quot;https://rsf.org/en/t%C3%BCrkiye-ten-years-state-hostility-towards-press-under-president-erdogan&quot;&gt;strongmen&lt;/a&gt;, like Erdoğan and Orbán: &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The exact playbook,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he, too, sees the judiciary as key. Judges will keep rejecting unconstitutional acts, as they&#39;ve been doing since the first days of Trump&#39;s presidency, starting with his attempt to rewrite&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-birthright-citizenship-1.7438981&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-birthright-citizenship-1.7438981&quot;&gt;citizenship eligibility&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s safe to expect Trump to complain, and perhaps be tempted to ignore a court order, but what matters, according to Miller, is whether he pulls back.&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Then maybe you come back from the brink,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;Miller&amp;nbsp;said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why so many eyes were glued to the case of alleged Venezuelan gang members this past weekend as a critical test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump had made unprecedented use of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/invocation-of-the-alien-enemies-act-regarding-the-invasion-of-the-united-states-by-tren-de-aragua/&quot; href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/invocation-of-the-alien-enemies-act-regarding-the-invasion-of-the-united-states-by-tren-de-aragua/&quot;&gt;Alien Enemies Act of 1798&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;outside wartime: he&#39;d labelled the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang a terrorist group, making suspected members eligible for immediate deportation, without standard legal proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatives insist some deportees were&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/relatives-missing-venezuelan-migrants-desperate-answers-after-us-deportations-el-2025-03-17/&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/relatives-missing-venezuelan-migrants-desperate-answers-after-us-deportations-el-2025-03-17/&quot;&gt;falsely accused&lt;/a&gt;, while the White House insists it acted on solid information,&amp;nbsp;and used the centuries-old law for&amp;nbsp;137 deportations last weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why one court case drew so much attention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://wtop.com/social-media/2025/03/a-timeline-of-the-legal-wrangling-and-deportation-flights-after-trump-invoked-the-alien-enemies-act/&quot; href=&quot;https://wtop.com/social-media/2025/03/a-timeline-of-the-legal-wrangling-and-deportation-flights-after-trump-invoked-the-alien-enemies-act/&quot;&gt;course of one chaotic Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, the constitutional showdown unfolded in a Washington court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the American Civil Liberties Union&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-and-democracy-forward-sue-trump-administration-over-expected-invocation-of-alien-enemies-act&quot; href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-and-democracy-forward-sue-trump-administration-over-expected-invocation-of-alien-enemies-act&quot;&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on behalf of five plaintiffs. A judge issued a written order not to deport them, and the Trump administration agreed. But hours later, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act, and deported the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an urgent hearing, the judge ordered those deportation flights paused; but the Trump administration said it was too late — two flights were already mid-air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, Trump&#39;s border czar Tom Homan&amp;nbsp;later brushed off the courts in a TV interview. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We&#39;re not stopping. I don&#39;t care what the judges think. I don&#39;t care what the left thinks. We&#39;re coming,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Homan told Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president himself has called for the judge&#39;s impeachment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This drew a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-federal-judges-impeachment-29da1153a9f82106748098a6606fec39&quot; href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-federal-judges-impeachment-29da1153a9f82106748098a6606fec39&quot;&gt;rebuke&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Tuesday from the chief justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, who in a rare public statement called this&amp;nbsp;an improper use of impeachment, a violation of two centuries&#39; understanding that judicial disagreements should be handled through&amp;nbsp;appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH | Trump clashes with courts over Alien Enemies Act:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:1--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump starts clash with courts by using Alien Enemies Act&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House is defending U.S. President Donald Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to speed up the deportation of migrants with alleged ties to gangs, even after a judge requested two planes with more than 261 deportees return to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal lawyers have also resisted the judge&#39;s request for information in court. But the administration&amp;nbsp;line is: this wasn&#39;t outright defiance; it was just too late to turn the planes around, as they&#39;d already left U.S. airspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Echoing that official line, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday:&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We are complying with the judge&#39;s orders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This starts a high-stakes standoff that can&#39;t last forever. Trump may find new ways to sidestep court orders, but sooner or later, there will be a direct clash with a judge, Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;They&#39;re saying, &#39;We&#39;re obeying the court order&#39; — wink, wink,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Miller said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I don&#39;t think they&#39;re ever going to come out and say, &#39;We&#39;re ignoring a court order.&#39;… [But] at some point it becomes unsustainable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s just one of the guardrails Trump tested in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also took the unprecedented step of challenging a predecessor&#39;s pardons: Trump said that because Joe Biden used a mechanical signature for his recent pardons, members of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-fauci-milley-pardons-january-6-3cba287f89051513fb48d7ae700ae747&quot; href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-fauci-milley-pardons-january-6-3cba287f89051513fb48d7ae700ae747&quot;&gt;congressional Jan. 6 committee&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that probed Trump&amp;nbsp;could still be prosecuted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he&amp;nbsp;escalated pressure on universities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump has now&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.ed.gov/media/document/dear-colleague-letter-sffa-v-harvard-109506.pdf&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ed.gov/media/document/dear-colleague-letter-sffa-v-harvard-109506.pdf&quot;&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;federal funding for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/office-civil-rights-initiates-title-vi-investigations-institutions-of-higher-education-0&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/office-civil-rights-initiates-title-vi-investigations-institutions-of-higher-education-0&quot;&gt;more than 50&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;universities over the suspected use of racial diversity programs in admissions criteria.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His administration has also&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2025/03/14/trump-administration-issues-list-of-demands-columbia-must-meet-to-maintain-federal-funding/&quot; href=&quot;https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2025/03/14/trump-administration-issues-list-of-demands-columbia-must-meet-to-maintain-federal-funding/&quot;&gt;made&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;nearly a dozen demands of Columbia University, which has already&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/doj-hhs-ed-and-gsa-announce-initial-cancelation-of-grants-and-contracts-columbia-university-worth-400-million&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/doj-hhs-ed-and-gsa-announce-initial-cancelation-of-grants-and-contracts-columbia-university-worth-400-million&quot;&gt;lost&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;$400 million in federal funding as punishment for unrest related to Gaza protests.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demands include putting Columbia&#39;s department of Middle East, South Asian&amp;nbsp;and African studies&amp;nbsp;under academic receivership; Columbia is also being encouraged to enforce a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definition-antisemitism&quot; href=&quot;https://holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definition-antisemitism&quot;&gt;definition&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of antisemitism that includes disparaging Israel as a racist project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there was a remarkable speech to the Justice Department, where Trump appeared to be publicly lobbying the legal apparatus to prosecute certain adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the epicentre of U.S. law enforcement, with a crowd cheering him on, Trump referred to certain political adversaries as &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;scum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He demanded accountability for people who investigated him, and referred four times to CNN and MSNBC as &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;illegal,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; accusing them of corrupt behaviour that must stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It was an absolutely extraordinary speech;&amp;nbsp;one of the most extraordinary ever by a sitting president,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equally stunning, in Miller&#39;s view: the minimal media reaction afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He cited this as an example of Trump&#39;s behaviour being normalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s become a cliché, Miller said, but just try, as a thought experiment, to imagine another U.S. president giving that speech. Imagine, say, Joe Biden saying those things; then imagine the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It would&#39;ve been one of the biggest stories in the last 100 years,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;But it&#39;s Trump.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Auto Workers, or UAW,&amp;nbsp;representing&amp;nbsp;thousands of American auto workers, has thrown itself behind U.S. President Donald Trump&#39;s tariffs against Canada and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We are glad to see an American president take aggressive action on ending the free trade disaster that has dropped like a bomb on the working class,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; the union said recently.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a sharply different position than the union&#39;s Canadian counterpart, which has denounced the tariffs and called the UAW&#39;s stance &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;naive,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; given the impact experts say tariffs will have on the auto industry and U.S. autoworkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;To think that Canada could just suffer and eat up these kinds of tariffs and it not to have an impact is completely naive in my opinion,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;Unifor National President Lana Payne said last Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:1--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labour and automotive experts say tariffs are very unlikely to bring legions of manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., citing the potentially devastating damage to the North American auto sector&#39;s deeply integrated supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, experts say the UAW&#39;s position is emblematic of decades of job losses,&amp;nbsp;shifting politics and new leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;U.S. auto workers have not had a great three decades,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;said Wayne Lewchuk, professor emeritus in the School of Labour Studies and Department of Economics at McMaster University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;They&#39;ve lost a lot of jobs, they have lost a lot of salary, they&#39;ve lost a lot of benefits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The split is also remarkable when you consider that the two unions used to be one. It wasn&#39;t until the 1980s that Canadian autoworkers broke off from the UAW to form their own union: the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW), which eventually became Unifor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-retaliatory-tariffs-1.7481258&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-retaliatory-tariffs-1.7481258&quot;&gt;Canada hits U.S. with tariffs on $29.8B worth of goods after Trump slaps levy on metals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/auto-sector-union-leaders-emergency-meeting-tariffs-1.7476498&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/auto-sector-union-leaders-emergency-meeting-tariffs-1.7476498&quot;&gt;Workers will fight if American car producers move to take Canadian jobs, union vows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It&#39;s a very, very serious breach of international solidarity because it&#39;s an acceptance, almost, of some of the ideological B.S. that&#39;s coming from Trump,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Herman Rosenfeld, a&amp;nbsp;retired CAW staffer who worked in the union&#39;s education department for 15 years.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payne said there have been discussions at the staff level between unions about the UAW&#39;s&amp;nbsp;stance on tariffs, and that the Canadian side is &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;not shy about making [its] position known.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of Unifor&#39;s leaders, who met recently&amp;nbsp;in London, Ont.,&amp;nbsp;to discuss the ongoing tariff threat, have also &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;expressed their anger with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; the UAW&#39;s position, Payne said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UAW did not respond to repeated interview requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&#39;s not the first time tensions have bubbled up between the unions, the experts said. In fact, past tensions are the reason why the unions splintered in the first place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A shared history&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early days, autoworkers in Canada and the U.S. were both represented by the UAW, which formed during the 1930s amid a broader push to unionize industrial workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UAW&#39;s Canadian regional office, as it was called, grew out of Windsor, Ont., still known as Canada&#39;s automotive capital.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;From the beginning, the UAW was an international union, but there were always tensions, and the tensions had to do with, &#39;This is a different country&#39;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Rosenfeld, who now writes about labour issues and politics from a socialist perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, the Canadian side of the union had a more militant reputation, which some&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://reuther.wayne.edu/files/LR000372.pdf&quot; href=&quot;https://reuther.wayne.edu/files/LR000372.pdf&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;attributes in part to the lack of collective bargaining rights in Canada until the mid-1940s.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Residents in Windsor, Ont., are bracing for possible tariffs. Just across the border, Americans are, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While U.S. President Donald Trump this week paused a host of tariffs on Canadian goods and auto for 30 days, the episode had had residents in Windsor bracing for the possible impact on a border city economy that depends on automotive and manufacturing jobs. The CBC&#39;s Jacob Barker went to Sterling Heights, Mich., where Ford and Stellantis, two major employers in Windsor, also have plants, to hear what residents there are thinking this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/205/301/ic/cdc/cau/essayframe13.html&quot; href=&quot;https://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/205/301/ic/cdc/cau/essayframe13.html&quot;&gt;differences&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;arose over the years, but the unions also fed off of each others&#39; victories, securing additional rights and benefits for their memberships.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensions swelled in the 1980s amid a growing debate over strategy, when&amp;nbsp;the American leadership of the union shifted toward a less aggressive position&amp;nbsp;while the Canadian side wanted&amp;nbsp;to maintain firm pressure on the auto companies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenfeld called this the start of the era of &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;concession bargaining,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; when the American wing of the union, seeing competition from the Japanese auto industry, accepted concessions for promises of job security.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It was seen as a fundamental change, and here in Canada, we rejected that,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/uaw-charges-corruption-jones-1.5488042&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/uaw-charges-corruption-jones-1.5488042&quot;&gt;&#39;Simple greed&#39;: Ex-UAW leader Jones charged with corruption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was ultimately this difference in opinion that drove the creation of the Canadian Auto Workers by the mid-1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North American Free Trade Agreement of the early 1990s provided fresh opportunities for tension between the two unions, Rosenfeld and Lewchuk said, by forcing workers in the U.S., Canada and now Mexico&amp;nbsp;to compete against each other for work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawn to its cheaper labour, automotive manufacturers shifted some production south to Mexico, leading to job losses in the heavily unionized Rust Belt, while advancements in automation and robotics replaced people&amp;nbsp;on assembly lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UAW&amp;nbsp;membership now sits at just under 400,000, a sharp decline from its peak of 1.5 million in the &#39;70s.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Big changes at the UAW&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, several UAW union leaders were&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-edmi/pr/united-states-reaches-settlement-united-auto-workers-union-reform-union-and-end&quot; href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-edmi/pr/united-states-reaches-settlement-united-auto-workers-union-reform-union-and-end&quot;&gt;convicted in corruption cases&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that included bribes from auto union executives and embezzlement of union funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in the fallout of that scandal that the union changed its rules to give the rank and file more say in who becomes president. Each member now gets a vote, instead of a smaller group of officials electing the leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was the election of Shawn Fain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under his leadership, the UAW launched a historic simultaneous strike against the Big Three automakers in 2023, securing new contracts with sizable pay increases for members.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fain also wielded significant power during the 2024 presidential race, ultimately throwing the union&#39;s support behind Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Harris lost, particularly in traditionally Democratic strongholds like Michigan, where thousands of autoworkers live.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;America&#39;s shifting politics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As job losses continued to mount after the 2008 financial crisis, blue collar workers who were historically reliable Democratic voters started to shift to the right – a shift that resulted in the partial collapse of the &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Blue Wall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; during Trump&#39;s first presidential win in 2016, and again last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His campaign promises to bring manufacturing jobs back to the American midwest have resonated with autoworkers in swing states like&amp;nbsp;Michigan, which remains the country&#39;s automotive capital.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;A lot of workers were sick and tired, and they were looking for some kind of alternative, even if it&#39;s a terrible right wing alternative,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Rosenfeld.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/gm-uaw-strike-ends-tentative-agreement-1.7012399&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/gm-uaw-strike-ends-tentative-agreement-1.7012399&quot;&gt;General Motors reaches deal with UAW, ending weeks-long strike&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-ontario-tariff-meeting-washington-1.7483312&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-ontario-tariff-meeting-washington-1.7483312&quot;&gt;Ford, feds say they had &#39;productive&#39; meeting with top Trump trade official in Washington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I&#39;m just assuming that the leader of the UAW is cognizant of a lot of his members&#39; perspectives on this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Peter Frise, an automotive industry expert at the University of Windsor, said it&#39;s unclear exactly why the UAW has come out in favour of tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It&#39;s a little puzzling to see the UAW aligning itself with far-right Republican policy and sort of throwing their union brethren under the bus,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Frise said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;But I guess you have to look at it from several different ways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fair trade, not free trade: Unifor&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewchuk, the McMaster professor, says the UAW&#39;s position to support Trump&#39;s tariffs should be seen less as anti-Canada, and more &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;as a way of breaking the free trade paradigm,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;which &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;has not served workers anywhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UAW in its March 4&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://uaw-newsroom.prgloo.com/press-release/uaw-statement-on-new-tariff-action&quot; href=&quot;https://uaw-newsroom.prgloo.com/press-release/uaw-statement-on-new-tariff-action&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;said the manufacturers should bear the brunt of tariffs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The working class suffered all the pain of NAFTA, and we won&#39;t suffer all the pain of undoing NAFTA,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; their statement reads.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frise, whose background is in engineering, argues that free trade has been good for the continent, saying the agreements of the past few decades &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;have been absolutely incredible at bringing stability, prosperity and good things to the North American marketplace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;There&#39;s no question about it ... there have been problems and some people have gotten hurt,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;But in the main, for the large swath of North American industry and North American workers, free trade has been exactly the right thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frise and other industry experts have repeatedly noted that trying to disentangle&amp;nbsp;the deeply interconnected supply chains would imperil both economies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It would take years to do that, many years and cost countless hundreds of billions of dollars,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Frise said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frise also said the manufacturers don&#39;t have the profit margins to absorb&amp;nbsp;tariffs at 25 per cent or more – especially since parts can cross the border several times before the car is finally assembled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a certain point –&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/auto-manufacturers-in-southwestern-ontario-warn-of-catastrophic-impacts-from-trump-tariffs-1.7448510&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/auto-manufacturers-in-southwestern-ontario-warn-of-catastrophic-impacts-from-trump-tariffs-1.7448510&quot;&gt;some say it could be a matter of days&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;– that cost becomes too much for the companies, especially smaller parts suppliers, leading to plant closures and job losses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unifor&amp;nbsp;says it&amp;nbsp;would like to see issues hammered out during the mandated renegotiations of the USMCA – NAFTA&#39;s successor that was signed during Trump&#39;s first term – next year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payne, the union&#39;s president, said she would like to focus on &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;fair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; trade rather than free trade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;If that is your lens, then you will get a trade agreement that lifts the living standards of workers,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I agree with the UAW, that is not what we got out of many of these trade agreements. But the reality is, that trade will still happen. So how do we make sure that that works for working people?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewchuk and Rosenfeld expressed support for &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;managed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; trade agreements, such as the original Auto Pact between Canada and the U.S. in the 1960s.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-trade-tariffs-timeline-1.7481280&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-trade-tariffs-timeline-1.7481280&quot;&gt;Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs. Here&#39;s a timeline of how we got here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenfeld says he would also like to see Canada move away from its closely intertwined economic relationship with the U.S. where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewchuk said &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;the real problem in the United States, to be frank, is the increasing inequality of distribution of what&#39;s produced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The rich have made out like bandits in the United States, and they&#39;ve left everyone else behind,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said. &quot;I&#39;m not seeing Trump reversing that trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a reason for optimism, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We&#39;re at a moment where things are coming unraveled, and that&#39;s the moment when you can make progress,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2019, foreign workers have been coming to Sioux Lookout through the federal Rural Northern Immigration Pilot Program (RNIP). It connected skilled workers to employers in small rural communities in need of labour while offering a pathway to permanent residency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But RNIP ended in August, leaving many workers and employers&amp;nbsp;uncertain about what comes next because the program replacing it doesn&#39;t include Sioux Lookout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palak Gulati is a customer service supervisor at grocery store Fresh Market, where she&#39;s been working on an open visa.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gulati chose Sioux Lookout, 350 kilometres from Thunder Bay, after studying in Toronto with the intention of continuing on to the RNIP program and eventually applying for permanent residency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gulati never imagined she&#39;d end up in a place like Sioux Lookout. But now, she doesn&#39;t want to leave.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I was never a girl who wanted to stay in a small town,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;she said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I always wanted to be in Toronto or Calgary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; But the small remote community is &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;peaceful&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; and has allowed her to tap into a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;quieter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; side of herself, she said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After RNIP ended in August, she stayed in Sioux Lookout. She liked the town and her job, and there was an expectation Sioux Lookout would be included in the&amp;nbsp;new program set to replace RNIP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Sioux&amp;nbsp;Lookout isn&#39;t in new federal program&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rural Community Immigration Pilot (RCIP) was billed as an extension of the RNIP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to RNIP, RCIP was designed to bring foreign workers to parts of the country that were less populated and in need of skilled workers. But the boundaries of the new program changed, which is why Sioux Lookout was left out in the cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked why Sioux Lookout was not included in the RCIP, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) said in a statement that all communities had the opportunity to apply to be part of RICP and to reach out to &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;contact Thunder Bay for more information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RCIP is administered by community-based economic development organizations, through funding and oversight from IRCC. Only organizations with a successful track record in implementing multi-year projects qualify. Sioux Lookout does not have an organization that is eligible to administer RCIP on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresh Air10:22Sioux Lookout Cut from Immigration Program, Leaving Workers and Businesses in LimboHost Ismaila Alfa explores the impact of recent federal immigration changes on Sioux Lookout, a vital hub for Northern Ontario. The town has relied on a program that brought skilled foreign workers to fill crucial jobs, but with its removal from the program, businesses and workers now face an uncertain future. CBC’s Shyloe Fagan reports from the community’s only grocery store to hear firsthand how the cuts are affecting daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thunder Bay&#39;s Community Economic Development Commission (CEDC) had been administering RNIP in Sioux Lookout along with nearly the entire Rainy River District, Dryden and&amp;nbsp;Thunder Bay District. But when RCIP came up, Thunder Bay decided that was too large a catchment area to include in its responsibility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thunder Bay&#39;s CEDC must ensure employers hiring foreign workers through RCIP meet the requirements and standards of the program.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Taylor, CEO of Thunder Bay&#39;s CEDC, said it &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;is very challenging for us in Thunder Bay to validate an employer in a community like Sioux Look because they don&#39;t have ties to the businesses or community, and if they make mistakes, it could put the program at risk for their own service delivery area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means after&amp;nbsp;Gulati&#39;s visa expires, for instance, she would have to go to one of the communities&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2025/01/canada-launches-rural-and-francophone-community-immigration-pilots.html&quot; href=&quot;https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2025/01/canada-launches-rural-and-francophone-community-immigration-pilots.html&quot;&gt;included in RCIP&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to pursue permanent residency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At her workplace, Fresh Market, the only independent grocery store in Sioux Lookout, immigration has been an essential part of how it has grown its business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Store owner Todd Nadon said foreign workers make up nearly half of his over 200-person staff. They&#39;ve helped him take business from a place where they were struggling to keep the shelves full to where they are today, with in-house butchers, bakers and pastry chefs, Nadon said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aimad Elhani is another of the foreign workers&amp;nbsp;who&#39;ve helped Nadon grow his business while creating a life for himself in Sioux Lookout. Elhani started as a baker after spending 10 years as a pastry chef in Dubai.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elhani credits his knowledge of French breads and finding efficiencies for his ability to advance in his work at Fresh Market. Now, he&#39;s the bakery manager. He&#39;s also married with two young daughters, and they recently moved into a bigger house in Sioux Lookout.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elhani also was able to become a permanent resident, but has friends who will be affected by the immigration changes. They are frustrated Sioux Lookout was not included in RCIP and are considering moving to Thunder Bay, he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadon said the&amp;nbsp;reduction in immigration to Canada could put some of his store&#39;s services at risk. In addition to serving the town of Sioux Lookout, Fresh Market works with 28 fly-in First Nations, shipping food north, a task that would be harder to do with fewer staff.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#39;I don&#39;t know what to do&#39;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadon added that getting staff to the community is difficult.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Sioux Lookout can be a bit of a shock,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remoteness and isolation can lead to loneliness, a challenge when it comes to recruiting workers. Another concern is housing. But to address these barriers, Fresh Market provides new staff with apartments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The housing is offered to workers from both Canada and abroad at a reduced rate, to help give them&amp;nbsp;settle in Sioux Lookout and keep them invested in the community, Nadon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satveer Kaur Sandhu, a customer service supervisor at Fresh Market who came to Sioux Lookout through RNIP,&amp;nbsp;is another worker who&#39;s concerned she may have to move and about the prospects of&amp;nbsp;permanent residency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandhu said the changes in immigration programs have&amp;nbsp;left her shaken and unsure about her future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I don&#39;t know what to do,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Sandhu said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wants people to understand how the changes are &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;affecting people at ground level&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; both mentally and physically.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadon said the hardest part is losing people who have helped contribute to making his business&amp;nbsp;great.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Efforts to reduce barriers for&amp;nbsp;foreign workers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other government options available to foreign workers who want to come to Sioux Lookout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the federal Express Entry program is competitive and ranks applicants based on their age, education and language proficiency. The Ontario Immigrate Nominee Program (OINP) nominates workers for permanent residency who have skills the province&#39;s economy needs, but limited spots are available.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The municipality of Sioux Lookout is collaborating with regional partners to advocate for more OINP slots and reduce barriers in bringing foreign workers to the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carney announced Canada will be working alongside Australia to build an early warning radar system along the Canada-U.S. border into the Arctic. Canada is investing more than $6 billion into the project, money that was already outlined in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/operations/allies-partners/norad/facesheet-funding-norad-modernization.html&quot; href=&quot;https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/operations/allies-partners/norad/facesheet-funding-norad-modernization.html&quot;&gt;the modernization plan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) announced in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is set to speak further about the announcement at 1:30 ET in Iqaluit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The radar system&#39;s long-range surveillance and threat-tracking capabilities will detect and deter threats across the North,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; reads a press release from Carney&#39;s office. Australia, it said, is a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;long-standing defence partner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; and will help make sure the system is developed and deployed quickly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government says it&#39;s also investing $420 million in new money to protect Canada&#39;s sovereignty of land, water and sea. The money will allow the Canadian Armed Forces to have a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;greater, sustained&amp;nbsp;and year-round&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; presence in the Arctic, and will expand its training and deployment in the North, the release said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carney also announced new&amp;nbsp;infrastructure investments worth $253 million&amp;nbsp;in the North: $94 million to upgrade power plants in Cambridge Bay, Gjoa Haven, Igloolik and Iqaluit; $74 million for affordable housing;&amp;nbsp;$66 million to build and repair homes;&amp;nbsp;and $20 million to Nunavut Nukkiksautiit Corporation for the first phase of its hydroelectricity facility outside of Iqaluit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When entering the store, shoppers are greeted by warning signs&amp;nbsp;that neither the store&#39;s elevators nor escalator work, and they must use the fire exit stairs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees aimlessly patrol&amp;nbsp;fragrance and cosmetic booths with no customers in sight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hudson&#39;s Bay was, for decades, a major shopping destination, offering multiple floors of fashion, accessories, furniture and appliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, it&#39;s likely to meet the same fate as other big&amp;nbsp;department stores in Canada like Eaton&#39;s and Sears, which have already closed their doors due to slow sales and mountains of debt.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hudson&#39;s Bay is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/hudsons-bay-court-1.7485365&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/hudsons-bay-court-1.7485365&quot;&gt;still holding out hope&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;it will secure enough financing to stay afloat and restructure. But a more likely scenario is that the deeply indebted retailer&amp;nbsp;will soon shut down, and start liquidation sales as early as this week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smaller versions of the department store model are still thriving, such as discount chain Walmart and Canadian fashion retailer, Simons. But the iconic department store with window displays&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;several floors of varied merchandise&amp;nbsp;is coming to a close in Canada.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some experts say the reason, at its core, is simple: These retail giants&amp;nbsp;got stuck in tradition and didn&#39;t change with the times.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;They were trying to work with an outdated model,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said retail strategist David Ian Gray.&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It just, over time, became archaic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sentiment is echoed by shoppers who feel bad for the Bay —&amp;nbsp;and don&#39;t shop there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It&#39;s kind of sad that they&#39;re going out of business,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said David Genio outside the Bay in downtown Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the next breath, he added:&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Their stuff is a little outdated I find and catered towards older people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the Bay in downtown Toronto, Cathy McCabe-Lokos&amp;nbsp;agrees that the chain&#39;s demise is sad. But she also admits that the location &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;has been empty, kind of desolate for years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The encroaching specialty&amp;nbsp;shop&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toronto&#39;s Eaton Centre shopping mall&amp;nbsp;is a microcosm for the demise of the traditional department store.&amp;nbsp; It opened 1977 with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaton%27s&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaton%27s&quot;&gt;Eaton&#39;s&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as its anchor —&amp;nbsp;one of Canada&#39;s largest&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_store&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_store&quot;&gt;department store&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;chains at the time. However, Eaton&#39;s declared bankruptcy&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/eaton-s-closing-doors-for-last-time-1.175747&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/eaton-s-closing-doors-for-last-time-1.175747&quot;&gt;in 1999&lt;/a&gt;, after more than 100 years in business.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Department store giant Sears took over the space until 2017, when it met a similar fate and shut down. U.S.-based Nordstrom then took over until 2023, when it&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-nordstrom-jobs-employees-shocked-1.6767952&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-nordstrom-jobs-employees-shocked-1.6767952&quot;&gt;pulled out of Canada&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;due to lagging sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gray says, starting in the 1990s, two big shopping trends aided the demise of the traditional department store: the growth of e-commerce and specialty shops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says department stores allowed shoppers to browse a large selection of merchandise, and gave them access to coveted brands smaller stores didn&#39;t carry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the emergence of online shopping allowed many brands to bypass department stores and sell directly to shoppers. It also meant Canadians could check out what&#39;s for sale without leaving their house.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WATCH | Bay plans to liquidate, close all stores&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:1--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hudson’s Bay plans to liquidate business, close all stores&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hudson’s Bay Company says it will start liquidating its entire business and begin the process of closing all its stores, pending court approval. The announcement comes just days after the company applied for creditor protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The idea of going to a department store and spending a couple hours just to keep current was completely irrelevant,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Gray, founder of DIG360 Consulting in Vancouver.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We stopped window shopping.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth of specialty retailers — like Ikea for furniture and Best Buy for electronics — also hurt the omnibus department store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They got &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;kicked at by specialty stores… that did it better and offered better range,&amp;nbsp;and better value, and better servicing,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said retail analyst and author, Bruce Winder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He cites as an example Sears, which used to be a go-to place for appliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;They were number one, right? And then Home Depot started eating their lunch,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said of the U.S.-based home improvement retailer,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/corporate-information/history.html&quot; href=&quot;https://www.homedepot.ca/en/home/corporate-information/history.html&quot;&gt;which arrived in Canada in 1997&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH | Simons opening stores while others shut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;down:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:2--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retailer Simons is opening stores when others are shutting down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As department stores across Canada struggle to stay afloat, Quebec&#39;s Simons is expanding, with two locations opening in Toronto next year — bringing the total number of Simons stores in Canada to 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winder says the versions of the department store that still thrive in Canada, such as Walmart and dollar stores, still appeal to shoppers&amp;nbsp;because their varied goods are priced at a discount.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The concept of having many different categories under one store is not forbidden. It&#39;s not bad, but you have to have the right price point,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Winder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&#39;t, he said, shoppers will trek to specialty stores where they&#39;ll typically pay more, but get added customer service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;At the Bay, if I saw a design from Gucci, well, I can just go to the Gucci store and get it,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Winder. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The expertise is better and the pricing is the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Simons moves in&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometime this year, Quebec-based retailer Simons is set to move into part of that ill-fated empty space in the Eaton Centre once inhabited by Eaton&#39;s, then Sears, then Nordstrom.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail experts predict Simons may have better success because, by selling only clothing and housewares, it&#39;s more of a specialty&amp;nbsp;than a department store.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, many items Simons sells are private-labels shoppers can&#39;t find elsewhere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The retailer&#39;s&amp;nbsp;model is perhaps one&amp;nbsp;traditional&amp;nbsp;department store giants should have considered when they began losing shoppers. But, as Gray points out, it&#39;s hard to reinvent the wheel when&amp;nbsp;your model was successful for decades.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It&#39;s almost impossible to then say, &#39;Hey, we&#39;re smart enough to see the writing on the wall and we need to blow that up to be successful again.&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lammy, who joined other G7 foreign ministers for talks in Quebec&#39;s Charlevoix region this week, stressed that &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Canada is a proud, strong, sovereign nation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; during a Canadian exclusive interview on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thehouse&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thehouse&quot;&gt;CBC&#39;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The House&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;airing Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;And [Canada] will continue to be a sovereign nation. Of that, I have no doubt,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Lammy told host Catherine Cullen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lammy, who has family in Canada, said he recognizes Canadians&#39; anxiety as Trump continues to call for Canada to become the 51st U.S. state. However, he repeatedly declined to answer whether he is personally concerned about Trump&#39;s rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;This is a moment for unity,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Lammy said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;That has been the point that we stressed at this G7. And all I can say and continue to say is that Canada is a sovereign country. It will continue to be a sovereign country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. foreign secretary urges Canada, U.S. and Brits to work together&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an exclusive Canadian interview U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said it is &#39;not a time to sow unnecessary division&#39; when asked about President Donald Trump’s threats to annex Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump&#39;s annexation talk has challenged Canada-U.K. relations, including over how public King Charles should be in standing up for Canadian sovereignty and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/king-charles-canada-politics-foreign-travel-invictus-games-1.7462594&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/king-charles-canada-politics-foreign-travel-invictus-games-1.7462594&quot;&gt;whether that clashes with British interests&lt;/a&gt;. Charles is the head of state for both countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last two weeks, Charles met with outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for a private audience, wore his Canadian medals during&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfgT0H-oRjQ&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfgT0H-oRjQ&quot;&gt;a high-profile military visit&lt;/a&gt;, planted a red maple leaf tree on the grounds of Buckingham Palace and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/king-charles-sword-canadian-attendant-1.7482738&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/king-charles-sword-canadian-attendant-1.7482738&quot;&gt;gave his personal Canadian liaison&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in Parliament a sword.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Charles has not spoken publicly about the Canada-U.S. friction. He also created a stir in late February by inviting Trump to Balmoral, a royal estate in Scotland. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/joly-starmer-canada-uk-1.7471906&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/joly-starmer-canada-uk-1.7471906&quot;&gt;invitation was brought to Trump&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer during a visit to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a news conference during Starmer&#39;s visit, a journalist asked the British prime minister whether Charles expressed concern over Trump&#39;s annexation comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starmer dodged the question and accused the journalist of &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;trying to find a divide between us that doesn&#39;t exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH | British prime minister downplays Trump&#39;s talk of annexing Canada:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:1--&gt;&lt;p&gt;British prime minister downplays Trump&#39;s talk of &#39;51st state&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a news conference with U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer downplayed Trump&#39;s recent talk of annexing Canada, saying reporters are looking for a division between Washington and London &#39;that doesn&#39;t exist.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We&#39;re the closest of nations, and we had very good discussions today. But we didn&#39;t discuss Canada,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Starmer said as the president interrupted him, saying, &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;that&#39;s enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lammy was asked why Charles should welcome Trump — a man who wishes to annex a Commonwealth realm — the British foreign secretary echoed Starmer&#39;s words and said &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;this is not a time to sow unnecessary division.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lammy also confirmed that Prime Minister Mark Carney will meet with Starmer next week when Carney flies to London — his first overseas trip in the new job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Russia-Ukraine ceasefire&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday morning, Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly said the G7 is united in supporting a U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal for Ukraine, which has been endorsed by Kyiv and is now awaiting a response from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Ultimately, the ball is now in Russia&#39;s court when it comes to Ukraine,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Joly said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lammy said Russian President Vladimir Putin needs to accept the terms of the ceasefire &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;so that we can get into the details of a negotiated peace, so that Ukraine has the security guarantees that are necessary, so that we get an enduring peace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a joint statement released Friday, the G7 foreign ministers said they &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;reaffirmed our unwavering support for Ukraine in defending its territorial integrity and right to exist, and its freedom, sovereignty and independence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foreign ministers also called for Russia to accept the ceasefire and implement it fully&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We discussed imposing further costs on Russia in case such a ceasefire is not agreed, including through further sanctions, caps on oil prices, as well as additional support for Ukraine&amp;nbsp;and other means,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lammy said Canada &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;has been forward-leaning on Ukraine, as the United Kingdom has been&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; and he expects both countries to be part of the group stepping up for the embattled Ukrainians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;So this coalition of the willing is forming, and the United Kingdom and Canada are side by side within it,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Lammy said.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, Poilievre says he’d kill the federal mandate for it</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Alberta Premier Danielle Smith welcomed a promise from the Conservative Party of Canada on Monday to eliminate the federal backstop on industrial carbon pricing, if it were to form the next federal government. Although it appears unlikely the province would abandon its longstanding pricing system altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We fully support Pierre Poilievre&#39;s commitment to return jurisdictional authority back to the provinces to regulate their own industrial emissions,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Smith said in a written statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2007, when Stephen Harper was prime minister and Ed Stelmach was premier, Alberta became&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://ecofiscal.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ecofiscal-Commission-10-Myths-about-carbon-pricing-March-2019-FINAL.pdf&quot; href=&quot;https://ecofiscal.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Ecofiscal-Commission-10-Myths-about-carbon-pricing-March-2019-FINAL.pdf&quot;&gt;the first jurisdiction in North America&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to put a price on industrial carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This policy is separate from the consumer-level carbon pricing —&amp;nbsp;commonly known as the &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;carbon tax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; —&amp;nbsp;that Alberta adopted in 2017 under NDP premier Rachel Notley, then&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-carbon-tax-repealed-1.5162899&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-carbon-tax-repealed-1.5162899&quot;&gt;repealed in 2019&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;under UCP premier Jason Kenney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/poilievre-industrial-carbon-price-1.7485500&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/poilievre-industrial-carbon-price-1.7485500&quot;&gt;Poilievre says he would repeal federal carbon pricing for industrial emissions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout all this flux, Alberta&#39;s industrial-scale pricing system has persisted. It has, however, undergone numerous changes over the years, including per-tonne price increases that keep it in line with the requirements of the federal backstop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre pledged to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/poilievre-industrial-carbon-price-1.7485500&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/poilievre-industrial-carbon-price-1.7485500&quot;&gt;eliminate federal carbon-pricing law altogether&lt;/a&gt;, including the backstop, if his party wins the next federal election. Provinces would be free to do as they like with their own industrial policies, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Alberta&#39;s industrial carbon-pricing system works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large-scale emitters —&amp;nbsp;such as oilsands facilities, power plants, and other facilities with more than 100,000 tonnes of annual emissions —&amp;nbsp;are subject to this industrial system of carbon pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carbon price only applies to the&amp;nbsp;portion of their emissions beyond facility-specific &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;benchmarks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; that are&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.alberta.ca/system/files/custom_downloaded_images/ep-fact-sheet-tier-regulation.pdf&quot; href=&quot;https://www.alberta.ca/system/files/custom_downloaded_images/ep-fact-sheet-tier-regulation.pdf&quot;&gt;calculated by a complex formula&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, facilities can also receive credits for cutting emissions&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.csaregistries.ca/GHGR_Listing/EPC_About.aspx&quot; href=&quot;https://www.csaregistries.ca/GHGR_Listing/EPC_About.aspx&quot;&gt;below their reduction targets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-emitting facilities can sell their credits to higher-emitting facilities, which can then use the credits to avoid paying a portion of the carbon price they owe. This effectively creates both a carrot and stick within a single policy, with the carrot for low-emitting facilities being funded by the stick that applies to high-emitting facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money from facilities that do pay the carbon price goes into a fund that is administered by a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.eralberta.ca/&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eralberta.ca/&quot;&gt;provincial agency&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;which offers grants to support projects and new&amp;nbsp;technologies &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;that reduce emissions, lower costs, attract investment, and create jobs in Alberta.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach to industrial carbon pricing has seen broad support from a variety of Alberta leaders, including former premier Jason Kenney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;That fund, paid for by major emitters, I think is a good way of doing it,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Kenney&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/ucp-kenney-carbon-tax-power-politics-large-emitters-1.4652145&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/ucp-kenney-carbon-tax-power-politics-large-emitters-1.4652145&quot;&gt;said in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, even as he campaigned against Alberta&#39;s consumer-level carbon tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Past support, future tweaks?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith, herself, has expressed support for the system, too, citing reductions in oilsands emissions intensity as proof of its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We&#39;re going to continue with an industrial carbon-pricing strategy because it is working,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-alberta-supports-industrial-carbon-pricing-premier-danielle-smith-says/&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-alberta-supports-industrial-carbon-pricing-premier-danielle-smith-says/&quot;&gt;she said last May&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alberta Environment Minister Rebecca Schulz said Monday the province may look at tweaking the details of its industrial carbon-pricing policy, if the federal backstop were to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noting Alberta&#39;s system has been in place &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;long before the federal Liberals came into power,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Schulz said it has &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;historically worked well for industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;However, I would say that the backstop and the carbon pricing put in place by the federal Liberal government has made our industry less competitive,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;So we&#39;re working with industry right now to gather their feedback on how we could do better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alberta NDP Leader Naheed Nenshi said Monday the federal government has&amp;nbsp;mismanaged the consumer carbon tax but the industrial carbon price has &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;always worked,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; in his view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting rid of the industrial pricing system altogether&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;would be disastrous for the industry and disastrous for the environment,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Nenshi added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Leach, an energy and environmental economist at the University of Alberta, said it&#39;s &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;probably likely&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; that Alberta would keep its system in place, if a Poilievre-led government were to scrap the federal backstop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The question is whether it will remain as stringent and biting as it otherwise would have been,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said, adding that a key issue is whether there will be enough pressure to ensure policies actually reduce emissions, if the federal policy were to be cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who pays for the carrot?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of his announcement Monday, Poilievre also promised to expand eligibility for existing federal tax credits to&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;reward heavy industries who make products with lower emissions than the world average.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said his government&#39;s approach would be &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;carrot, not stick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But removing the carbon-price stick in favour of a larger tax-credit carrot also means taxpayers would cover more of the cost of that carrot, said Chris Severson-Baker, executive director of the Pembina Institute, a clean energy think-tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;This proposal really is to shift from a polluter-pays system … to taxpayer-pay system,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It would be shifting entirely to a system of subsidies, rather than a mix of incentives to reduce emissions, combined with incentives to invest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:1--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poilievre says &#39;bring home clean production&#39; to cut fossil fuel emissions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22 hours agoDuration1:23Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is asked if he is prepared to commit Canada to any kind of emissions targets if he were to become prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Severson-Baker&#39;s view, the proposal also introduces &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;an enormous amount of uncertainty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; into the decisions companies are trying to make around new investment in the country, at a time in which Canada is already grappling with a new landscape under U.S. President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The last thing we want to do is add to the uncertainty that investors are experiencing in Canada right now,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said Poilievre&#39;s plan would also hurt Canada&#39;s ability to expand and diversify its trading partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I would say Mr. Poilievre actually doesn&#39;t really understand how the industrial pricing system works,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-2024-national-inventory-report-2022-greenhouse-gas-emissions-1.7192042&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-2024-national-inventory-report-2022-greenhouse-gas-emissions-1.7192042&quot;&gt;Alberta&#39;s emissions down slightly but still make up lion&#39;s share of Canada&#39;s greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilkinson noted that &quot;the European Union is in the process of putting in place&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/carbon-border-adustments-carbon-tariffs-explainer-1.7412677&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/carbon-border-adustments-carbon-tariffs-explainer-1.7412677&quot;&gt;border carbon adjustments&lt;/a&gt;, which means that decarbonization&amp;nbsp;is really important if we want to trade with Europe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Long-term competitiveness and jobs and economic growth rely on us actually moving forward with decarbonization,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;In Alberta, most of the money that comes from the industrial price is recycled to industry to actually invest in decarbonization projects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pathways Alliance, which last year publicly&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/pathways-alliance-derek-evans-west-of-centre-net-zero-poilievre-1.7207594&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/pathways-alliance-derek-evans-west-of-centre-net-zero-poilievre-1.7207594&quot;&gt;pressed Poilievre to clarify his position on industrial carbon pricing&lt;/a&gt;, told CBC News on Monday it had no comment on his promise to get rid of the federal backstop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#39;s office accused Hamas of &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;repeated refusal to release our hostages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; and rejecting proposals from U.S. President Donald Trump&#39;s mideast envoy Steve Witkoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; his office said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After heavy strikes, the Israeli army issued evacuation orders for a number of neighbourhoods in Gaza, according to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Hamas&amp;nbsp;accused Israel of overturning the hard-fought ceasefire deal agreed to in January,&amp;nbsp;leaving the fate of 59 hostages still held in Gaza uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strikes in Gaza were reported in multiple locations on Tuesday during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Officials from Gaza&#39;s Hamas-run health ministry said many of the dead were children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel&#39;s renewed intense pressure on Hamas came as tensions flared elsewhere in the Middle East, a major supplier of oil to global markets, which has seen the Gaza war spread to Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH |&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Israeli army orders Palestinians to evacuate part of Rafah:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palestinians flee eastern Rafah after Israel issues evacuation orders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People loaded up belongings and started moving out of eastern Rafah, in southern Gaza, on Tuesday after the Israeli army issued evacuation orders for a number of neighbourhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump said on Monday he would hold Iran responsible for any further attacks on international shipping carried out by the Houthi group, as his administration expanded strikes in Yemen —&amp;nbsp;the biggest U.S. military operation in the region since he returned to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strikes were reported in&amp;nbsp;locations&amp;nbsp;including northern Gaza, Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah in central and southern Gaza Strip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It was a night of hell. It felt like the first days of the war,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Rabiha Jamal, 65, a mother of five from Gaza City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We were preparing to have something to eat before starting a new day of fasting when the building shook and explosions began. We thought it was over but war is back,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she told Reuters via a chat app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hospitals strained by 15 months of bombardment, piles of bodies in white plastic sheets could be seen stacked up as casualties were brought in. Gaza&#39;s Hamas-run health ministry said 404 people had been killed, many of them children, and 562 people were injured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attacks condemned by Egypt, Turkey&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Israel Defence Forces said it&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;http://x.com/IDF/status/1901802698237935705&quot; href=&quot;http://x.com/IDF/status/1901802698237935705&quot;&gt;hit dozens of targets&lt;/a&gt;, and that the strikes would continue for as long as necessary and would extend beyond air strikes,&amp;nbsp;raising the prospect that Israeli ground troops could resume fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strikes drew swift reaction and condemnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations&#39; Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory urged for the ceasefire in Gaza to be immediately reinstated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Waves of airstrikes occurred across the Gaza strip since the early hours of the morning ... This is unconscionable,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Muhannad Hadi said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia said on Tuesday that it was concerned by what it called a large number of civilian casualties after Israel struck Gaza and hoped that peace would return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Undoubtedly, it&#39;s another deterioration in the situation [in Gaza] and another spiral of escalation that is causing our concern,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-attacks-strike-yemen-houthis-red-sea-ships-1.7485220&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-attacks-strike-yemen-houthis-red-sea-ships-1.7485220&quot;&gt;Houthi rebels vow to &#39;meet escalation with escalation&#39; after deadly U.S. airstrikes in Yemen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Egypt said Israel&#39;s action violated the ceasefire and marked a dangerous escalation, while Turkey&#39;s foreign ministry said Israel&#39;s attacks represented a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;new phase in its policy of genocide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; against Palestinians and urged the international community to take a determined stance to ensure a ceasefire is upheld and humanitarian aid is delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attacks were far wider in scale than the regular series of drone strikes the Israeli military has said it has conducted against individuals or small groups of suspected militants and follows weeks of failed efforts to agree on an extension to the truce, which began on Jan.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the international condemnation, the airstrikes earned Netanyahu a political boost. Former national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who left the government over disagreements about the&amp;nbsp;Gaza&amp;nbsp;ceasefire,&amp;nbsp;is rejoining&amp;nbsp;the coalition after the resumption of Israeli strikes, a statement said, strengthening Netanyahu&#39;s government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Senior Hamas officials killed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those killed was senior Hamas official Mohammad Al-Jmasi, a member of the political office, and members of his family, including his grandchildren who were in his house in Gaza City when it was hit by an airstrike on Tuesday, Hamas sources and relatives said. In all, at least five senior Hamas officials were killed along with members of their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people were brought to overwhelmed hospitals by private cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strike on a home in the southern Gaza city of Rafah&amp;nbsp;killed 17 members of one family — including at least 12 women and children, according to the European Hospital, which received the bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH l Airstrikes began overnight early Tuesday:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:1--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel sends barrage of airstrikes into Gaza&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israeli military launched a series of airstrikes into Gaza, hitting dozens of locations and killing at least 80 people. The strikes are expected to effectively end the fragile ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Washington, a White House spokesperson said Israel had consulted the U.S. administration before it carried out the strikes, which the military said targeted mid-level Hamas commanders and leadership officials as well as infrastructure belonging to the militant group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; White House spokesperson Brian Hughes said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiating teams from Israel and Hamas had been in Doha as mediators from Egypt and Qatar sought to bridge the gap between the two sides following the end of an initial phase in the ceasefire, which saw 33 Israeli hostages and five Thais returned by militant groups in Gaza in exchange for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Aid deliveries blocked&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the backing of the United States, Israel had been pressing for the return of the remaining 59 hostages still held in Gaza in exchange for a longer-term truce that would have halted fighting until after the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan and the Jewish Passover holiday in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However Hamas had been insisting on moving to negotiations for a permanent end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, in accordance with the terms of the original ceasefire agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each side has accused the other of failing to respect the terms of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/israel-hamas-ceasefire-deal-gaza-1.7221603&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/israel-hamas-ceasefire-deal-gaza-1.7221603&quot;&gt;the January ceasefire agreemen&lt;/a&gt;t, and there were multiple hiccups during the course of the first phase. But until now, a full return to the fighting had been avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israeli communities on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies, and abducting 251 hostages into Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israeli campaign in response has killed more than 48,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and destroyed much of the housing and infrastructure in the enclave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of travellers entering the U.S. in a passenger vehicle — the most common way to make the trip —&amp;nbsp;dropped from 2,696,512 in February 2024&amp;nbsp;to 2,223,408 last month,&amp;nbsp;reaching levels not seen since cross-border travel normalized in the post-COVID-19&amp;nbsp;era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the number of travellers driving over the U.S. land border is the lowest it&#39;s been since April 2022,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/travel&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/travel&quot;&gt;according to&amp;nbsp;CBP&amp;nbsp;data&lt;/a&gt;. The Canadian government didn&#39;t&amp;nbsp;lift all travel-related restrictions, like testing and quarantine measures,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid&quot; href=&quot;https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid&quot;&gt;until October of that year&lt;/a&gt;. The fact that the current flow of travellers is&amp;nbsp;at the same level as when travel was much more arduous is revealing, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data shows there was a sudden reversal in February, just as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-tariffs-canada-february-1-1.7447829&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-tariffs-canada-february-1-1.7447829&quot;&gt;Trump was launching his trade war&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and ramping up his annexationist rhetoric about Canada becoming the 51st state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;number of cross-border travellers headed for the U.S.&amp;nbsp;in October, November, December and January&amp;nbsp;were all well above the numbers reported for the same month the year prior — but in February there was a clear break in the upward trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Len Saunders is an immigration lawyer in Blaine, Wash., a town of about 6,000 people right on the border with B.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the decline in Canadian day trippers is evident at every turn in a town that caters to cross-border travellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;This is like COVID all over again,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said in an interview with CBC News. &quot;With the rhetoric coming from Trump — people just don&#39;t want to come down here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;If you&#39;re not buying American liquor in B.C., you&#39;re definitely not coming here to save 20 bucks on gas. There&#39;s just a huge reduction in Canadians — you can see it in the Costco parking lot, at Trader&amp;nbsp;Joe&#39;s. Canadians are voting with their wallets right now. That&#39;s what&#39;s happening,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saunders said the 51st state taunts, the tariff threats and the reports of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-woman-detained-us-border-1.7484937&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-woman-detained-us-border-1.7484937&quot;&gt;Canadians&amp;nbsp;being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(ICE)&amp;nbsp;are all&amp;nbsp;driving people away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We&#39;re only two months into a four-year administration. If they keep this up&amp;nbsp;there will be no Canadians coming down here — there will be a 100 per cent boycott of this country,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barbara Barrett is the executive director of the Frontier Duty Free Association, a group that represents 32 independently owned duty-free shops that dot the Canadian side of the land border from coast to coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said the&amp;nbsp;travel decline is &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;catastrophic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; and the mostly family-run stores she represents are seeing sales drop off dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said sales never really recovered after the pandemic and now, with the recent disruptions, are down about 80 per cent compared to pre-2020 figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Without hyperbole, it&#39;s a dire situation. It&#39;s very worrying,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Barrett said in an interview with CBC News. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It&#39;s pandemic-level stuff for sure. It&#39;s dramatic — the borders are just not seeing the traffic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poor Canada-U.S. exchange rate, which is partly driven by Trump&#39;s trade&amp;nbsp;policies, has made jaunts over the border less attractive for many Canadian tourists and bargain-hunting shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Barrett said cross-border traffic declines are not because of the bad exchange rate — she thinks it&#39;s driven by the anti-tariff sentiment that&#39;s led many Canadians to drop travel to the U.S. while the country is in this fight with Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We&#39;ve seen the dollar fluctuate up and down before and we haven&#39;t seen this sort of dramatic decline,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;If it was all about the dollar — we&#39;d have a flood of Americans coming over and we&#39;re not seeing that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond passenger vehicles, there are other signs of a travel drop-off in the CBP data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;number of truck drivers making the cross-border trip fell from 493,000 in February 2024 to 473,000 this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are relatively few pedestrians crossing the border by foot in the dead of winter, but those figures were also lower. CBP reported the number of walkers fell from roughly 117,000 in February 2024&amp;nbsp;to 99,000 last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of passengers travelling by air to the U.S. held steady and&amp;nbsp;increased slightly compared to the same month last year&amp;nbsp;— 50,000 more people made the trip —&amp;nbsp;but even air travel hit a multi-month low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air travel is usually booked weeks or months in advance and is generally harder to cancel than a day&amp;nbsp;trip by land.&amp;nbsp;Some airlines have also since reported&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/canadians-cancel-us-trips-tariffs-weak-loonie-1.7477127&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/canadians-cancel-us-trips-tariffs-weak-loonie-1.7477127&quot;&gt;a slump&amp;nbsp;in U.S. bookings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistics Canada data backs up what the CBP is reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, the number of Canadian residents returning from the U.S. by automobile dropped 23 per cent compared to the same month in 2024,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/250310/dq250310d-eng.htm&quot; href=&quot;https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/250310/dq250310d-eng.htm&quot;&gt;according to the agency.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were about 1.2 million return trips last month compared to 1.5 million the year before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The federal agency described those&amp;nbsp;figures as a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;steep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; decline, comparable to the drop-off registered during the health crisis when cross-border travel ground to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a decline in Americans coming to Canada by automobile, but the drop was not as dramatic, StatsCan found, with a 7.9 per cent slump recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump first launched his trade war with Canada on Feb. 1, which prompted former prime minister Justin Trudeau to respond with retaliatory tariffs and a call for Canadians to buy local products and travel within Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trudeau urged people&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;to choose Canada&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; to send a signal to the White House that the country won&#39;t stand for punishing tariffs that have the potential to torpedo the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It might mean changing your summer vacation plans, staying here in Canada and exploring the many sites, national parks and historical destinations our country has to offer,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canadians shunning travel to United States, new data suggests&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New data shows Canadians are taking fewer trips to the United States, especially by land, with many citing the political climate under U.S. President Donald Trump as the top reason for not crossing the border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump has&amp;nbsp;imposed 25 per cent tariffs on some Canadian goods to supposedly spur action on drugs and migrants at the border. He later&amp;nbsp;added another tariff layer with a 25 per cent levy&amp;nbsp;on steel and aluminum imports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president is also expected to hit Canada with more &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;retaliatory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; tariffs on April 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada&amp;nbsp;punched back with its own countermeasures, which Prime Minister Mark Carney has said will remain in place &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;until the Americans show us respect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking to CBC&amp;nbsp;on Thursday&amp;nbsp;afternoon, not long after getting word of Jasmine Mooney&#39;s upcoming release from an Arizona detention centre, Stephen Mooney said he&#39;s feeling a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;lot of relief&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; — but also a lot of frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Jasmine&#39;s a strong girl, but what she has gone through is&amp;nbsp;… no one should do that,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Stephen, who lives in Whitehorse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Just the lack of due process and the lack of communication that we&#39;ve had through that detention centre,&amp;nbsp;I feel for, of course, not only Jasmine, but the many other people that are in there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking to CBC News earlier Thursday, Jasmine&#39;s mother, Alexis Eagles, said her daughter — who grew up in Yukon and had been living in B.C. until last year — was being detained at the San Luis Regional Detention Center&amp;nbsp;after she recently tried to enter the U.S. from Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eagles said Jasmine obtained a three-year work visa for the U.S. last spring and had been living in Los Angeles, working in marketing communications. According to Eagles, Mooney came back to Canada for a visit in November and when she tried to return to the States, her visa was revoked and she was denied entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eagles is less clear on what happened next, but said that&amp;nbsp;Mooney then got &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;some sort of consulting visa application.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;She attempted to return to the States with the new visa, and she had already been flagged so they just detained her,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Eagles said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;As we understand it, it&#39;s because she was entering via Mexico …&amp;nbsp;we believe that had she been entering, tried to enter directly through Canada, they would have just turned her around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Facebook post, Eagles said Jasmine&amp;nbsp;was held at the San Ysidro border crossing for three days after she tried to enter the U.S. on March 3, and was then moved to San Diego before she and others were &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;forcibly removed from their cells at 3 a.m.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; and sent to the Arizona facility around March 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eagles said she acknowledges that her daughter&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;did not make a good decision, that she probably should not have tried to enter the States…. We don&#39;t deny that she was detained because of the way she tried to enter the States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBC News has reached out to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but did not hear back as of Thursday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Detainees&amp;nbsp;were &#39;treated inhumanely,&#39; says mother&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eagles&#39;s concern was with the treatment Jasmine&amp;nbsp;has experienced while in detention, and the fact that it was&amp;nbsp;never&amp;nbsp;clear when or how she might be released. Eagles is also frustrated by how difficult it&#39;s been to get information about Jasmine, having to rely on friends in the U.S. for periodic updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;She&#39;s been moved to three different facilities,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Eagles said in an interview from Abbotsford, B.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eagles said the detainees at the San Luis facility&amp;nbsp;have no sleeping mats or blankets or windows, and the lights are on all day and night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;That&#39;s what we have the problem with, the fact that she is being detained longer than we feel is necessary. She is being frequently moved, and they are being treated inhumanely,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Eagles said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday afternoon, Stephen Mooney said Jasmine is due to be released from the Arizona detention facility&amp;nbsp;on Friday. From there, she will be brought to a detention centre in Tijuana, Mexico, and then flown back to Vancouver on Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mooney said his daughter&amp;nbsp;has been &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;in shackles and handcuffs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; the majority of the time she&#39;s been in custody. He also said he saw a picture of her on Thursday, and that she had clearly lost some weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;You know, 11 days. They don&#39;t feed them much,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mooney believes that some political pressure helped secure his daughter&#39;s&amp;nbsp;release, but he didn&#39;t offer any more specifics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:1--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;There were conversations at the highest level, and I would like to think that helped get her released earlier,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;There&#39;s 30 other people in her cell that have not even been spoken to by a detention caseworker. So there are people in there whose families don&#39;t know where their kids are.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#39;Profoundly concerned,&#39; says B.C. premier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to reporters earlier on Thursday, B.C. Premier David Eby said he didn&#39;t know all of the details of Mooney&#39;s case but said his &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;heart goes out to this family and this woman,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; and he urged Canadian officials to work quickly to try to bring Jasmine back to Canada.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eby also said he was &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;profoundly concerned about these kind of actions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; by the U.S. administration, saying they &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;violate the very idea that Canadians are safe in the U.S. when we visit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The nature of our relationship is so fraught right now that this case makes us all wonder, you know, what about our relatives who are working in the States?

&lt;p&gt;Yukon Premier Ranj Pillai also weighed in on Thursday, with a letter to the acting director of&amp;nbsp;U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement urging Jasmine&#39;s &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;prompt release,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; and saying &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;the treatment of our citizens while in the U.S. must be fair and transparent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Mooney says his daughter had moved to L.A. and put &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;hundreds of thousands of dollars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; into a new startup business there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not clear yet what she might do next, after&amp;nbsp;she arrives in&amp;nbsp;Canada. He describes his daughter as hard-working and &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;super-resilient,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; but he wonders if this experience might prompt her to find a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;new calling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Of course, we&#39;ve got to&amp;nbsp;question that now — do you really want to work in the States after this has happened to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Stephen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;That process down there is terrible, and I believe it&#39;s worse because of the new administration, because of Trump … I would be cautious for anyone to go into the States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the beleaguered retailer said in an Ontario court Monday morning that if approved by the judge, the liquidation would span 80 stores as well as three Saks Fifth Avenue stores and 13 Saks Off 5th locations in Canada that it owns through a licensing agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process Hudson&#39;s Bay is proposing would allow the retailer to remove some stores from the liquidation, should it find sufficient financing during the 10 to 12 weeks when lawyer Ashley Taylor expects the company to offload its inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;A quick start will maximize the value of the business ... and preserve whatever chance there is of a restructuring,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Taylor told Ontario Superior Court Judge Peter Osborne in a hearing at a Toronto courtroom Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH | Canada&#39;s oldest retailer winds up operations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hudson’s Bay plans to liquidate business, close all stores&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hudson’s Bay Company says it will start liquidating its entire business and begin the process of closing all its stores, pending court approval. The announcement comes just days after the company applied for creditor protection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearing attracted so many lawyers, media and other observers that&amp;nbsp;an overflow room had to be opened to facilitate spectators there to learn what will come of the retailer dating back to 1670, when the country was involved with the fur trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearing was meant to advance a creditor protection case Hudson&#39;s Bay launched March 7, when it admitted it was struggling with financial difficulties amid subdued consumer spending, Canada-U.S. trade tensions and post-pandemic drops in downtown store traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said the situation has become so bad that it deferred some payments to landlords, service providers and vendors and was days away from not being able to meet payroll obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it struggled, a landlord &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;unlawfully locked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Hudson&#39;s Bay out of a store located in Sydney, N.S., and a team of bailiffs attempted to seize merchandise from a location it runs in Toronto, Ont., mall Sherway Gardens, said Jennifer Bewley, the chief financial officer for Hudson&#39;s Bay&#39;s parent company, in a court filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Financing falls apart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the company filed for creditor protection, Hudson&#39;s Bay lawyer Taylor said the retailer&#39;s plan was to restructure by liquidating half its stores and monetizing some of the leases it tends to hold in prime, high-traffic spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That plan was to be carried out under debtor-in-possession financing, which lenders make available to troubled companies in order to help them restructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the run-up to the March 7 court hearing, Taylor said the company had two lenders interested in supplying that funding. But three hours before, the financing from its chosen suitor &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;fell apart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; and the retailer &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;scrambled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; to get an alternative together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That alternative came in the form of $16 million in funding commitments from U.S.-based investment management firm Restore Capital and other lenders, expanded to $23 million soon after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the boost, the commitments weren&#39;t enough to satisfy all of Hudson&#39;s Bay&#39;s needs, forcing the company to &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; its efforts to find more cash, Taylor said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/hudsons-bay-shoppers-what-you-need-to-know-1.7482709&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/hudsons-bay-shoppers-what-you-need-to-know-1.7482709&quot;&gt;Hudson&#39;s Bay is in limbo after filing for creditor protection. Here&#39;s what you need to know&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/hudsons-bay-debt-court-filings-1.7483641&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/hudsons-bay-debt-court-filings-1.7483641&quot;&gt;Hudson&#39;s Bay Company nearly $1B in debt, with court filings painting dire financial portrait&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s since reached out to at least 19 potential lenders and major landlords who could offer rent concessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;To date, the company&#39;s efforts have failed,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Taylor said in court Monday as he described why the company needed to pursue liquidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ontario takes the biggest hit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liquidation Hudson&#39;s Bay is seeking will span the company&#39;s entire footprint, with Ontario taking the bulk of the hit because it&#39;s where the company has 32 locations and more than half of its employees work. B.C. hosts 16 locations;&amp;nbsp;Alberta and Quebec each have 13; and Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan have two per province.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saks Fifth Avenue&#39;s Canadian sites are split between Ontario and Alberta and Saks Off 5th has stores in Ontario, B.C., Alberta, Quebec and Manitoba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidating its entire business would put&amp;nbsp;more than 9,000 jobs at risk.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Pillon, another lawyer who appeared on Hudson&#39;s Bay&#39;s behalf, said the company has about $315 million in inventory on its balance sheet right now and the proposed liquidation will extend to its e-commerce business, which will continue until the company&#39;s Scarborough, Ont., distribution centre empties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company plans to stop accepting gift cards after April 6 and has already paused its loyalty program, with more than 8.2 million Canadian customers holding about $58.5 million in unused points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hudson&#39;s Bay is also seeking permission to launch a process to find a buyer for some or all of its properties or the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process would allow potential buyers to make a bid for some of the company&#39;s leases or just intellectual property, like Hudson&#39;s Bay&#39;s branding or rights to its famed stripe&amp;nbsp;trademarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company will also keep seeking financing.&amp;nbsp;But some experts say finding a backer will be no easy feat for a business that has struggled with even &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;simple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; matters like keeping escalators working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It is a major challenge and no doubt with some large strings attached,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Lanita Layton, a luxury and retail consultant and a former Holt Renfrew&amp;nbsp;vice-president, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Depending on who, if anyone does bring the financing, I don&#39;t foresee HBC continuing in the same format.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says Hudson&#39;s Bay&#39;s most logical path forward will be shrinking the company to a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;manageable size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; by operating a smaller number of stores more &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;conducive to today&#39;s customer desires,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; which include a unique product mix, experiential opportunities, exciting visuals and great customer service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;This marks the end of a nearly 400-year-old institution which is going to have significant impacts in reshaping the Canadian retail landscape, with major consequences for employees, customers, as well as broader retailers operating in Canada,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Jenna Jacobson, director of the Retail Leadership Institute at Toronto Metropolitan University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be a real challenge for malls as large department stores act as the anchors in a lot of malls and also act as the driver to bring in consumers, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Filling that space is very challenging, because what retailer is able to take over that amount of space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Origins of Hudson&#39;s Bay&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hudson&#39;s Bay Company, in its original form, was founded by fur traders and owned a vast tract of northern Canada around Hudson Bay where it operated a far-flung chain of trading posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dating back to&amp;nbsp;1670, it has been deeply entrenched in Canadian history, but&amp;nbsp;has been led by Americans for several decades now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The architect behind most of the Bay&#39;s modern history is&amp;nbsp;Richard Baker,&amp;nbsp;an American real estate titan whose National Realty and Development Corp. Equity Partners bought the company in 2008 from the widow of late South Carolina businessman Jerry Zucker for $1.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker took it public in 2012, only to reverse course through a takeover bid that had to be sweetened twice before shareholders accepted it in early 2020, ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carney was presented to the King inside Buckingham Palace, and explained to Canada&#39;s monarch that he did not have his Order of Canada pin because it fell off and broke on the tarmac upon his arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles jokingly offered Carney his pin, but the prime minister refused, saying he is &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;not of that rank.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Carney&#39;s first official foreign trip since he was sworn in on March 14, which includes visits to France and&amp;nbsp;the U.K. He will meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in London before stopping in&amp;nbsp;Iqaluit on his way back to Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip to London is a bit of a homecoming, as Carney became the first non-British governor in the Bank of England&#39;s 319-year history when he took over the top job on July 1, 2013. He served until March 15, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Mark Carney sits down with King Charles in London during his first foreign trip as Canada’s prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carney began the day in Paris with a visit to the rebuilt Notre-Dame Cathedral before sitting down for a private lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Palais de l&#39;Élysée.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It is more important than ever for Canada to strengthen its ties with its reliable allies, such as France,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Carney said in French before lunch with Macron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Describing Canada as the &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;most European of non-European countries,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Carney told Macron he is &quot;determined, like you, to maintain the most positive possible relations with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We must strengthen our diplomatic ties to address a world that is increasingly unstable and dangerous,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Canada is a reliable, trustworthy and strong partner of France, which shares our values and lives them through action, during this age of economic and geopolitical crisis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Mark Carney, appearing alongside French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Monday, said Canada and France must strengthen their ties, adding that &#39;Canada is a reliable, trustworthy and strong partner of France.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macron said the diplomatic relationship with Canada supports the values both countries hold dear, such as the &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;development for fair trade and protection of the planet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; and the defence of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since U.S. President Donald Trump came back into office, he has imposed tariffs on Canadian goods including steel and aluminum and made numerous remarks about his desire to turn Canada into the 51st state. He is threatening to impose tariffs on all Canadian products on April 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macron did not mention Trump by name but he did condemn the imposition of tariffs on U.S. allies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We believe that fair trade that respects international rules is a good thing for everyone&#39;s prosperity,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Macron said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It&#39;s far more effective than tariffs that simply create inflation and destroy the integration of our economies and our supply chains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What would it mean if it happens?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;In Canada&#39;s arsenal of possible responses to a Trump tariff, the nuclear option is the threat to withhold, reduce or place export tariffs on Canadian energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already, the mere suggestion of such a tactic has&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-premiers-trudeau-meeting-trump-tariffs-1.7431085&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-premiers-trudeau-meeting-trump-tariffs-1.7431085&quot;&gt;caused a split&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;between the government of Alberta, on one side, and the governments of Canada and all other provinces on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tariffs on imports from the U.S. have the potential to cause pain to certain industries and regions, but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself has acknowledged that the effect of Canada&#39;s import tariffs would be diluted by the size of the U.S.&amp;nbsp;population and economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The withholding or tariffing of Canadian resource exports, on the other hand, has the potential to cause real, generalized discomfort to the U.S. — albeit at great cost to Canada as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The idea of the threat is hopefully going to do most of the heavy lifting,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Sanjay Jeram, senior lecturer of political science at Simon Fraser University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It&#39;s not as if it can&#39;t happen — that we can&#39;t impose either some sort of export tariff on oil and gas to raise the cost, or some kind of outright ban,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he told CBC News. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;That could be done by the federal government alone. The Constitution does have ways of permitting that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Jeram says Canada&#39;s position has been weakened by the stance taken by Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, which opens the door for the Trump administration to play divide and rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Does that division within the country make it more likely that Trump would see that we couldn&#39;t really sustain that disunity … and perhaps would be more willing to wait it out?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Jeram said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;That&#39;s the real trouble, I think, in the demonstration of disunity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Canada&#39;s strongest card&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, there are reasons to believe that Canada&#39;s strongest cards in a trade war are not what it would decline to buy, but rather what it would decline to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil is not the only resource card that Canada holds, says Lawrence Herman, an international trade lawyer and former Canadian diplomat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&#39;s probably the maximum leverage we have — the weapon, if you want to put it that way, that would have the most impact on the U.S. side. But as we all know, it is highly divisive politically in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;There are ways, however, in which this could be done,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Herman told CBC News, pointing to Ontario Premier Doug Ford&#39;s willingness to cut off electricity exports&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;http://www.energy.gov/oe/learn-more-about-interconnections&quot; href=&quot;http://www.energy.gov/oe/learn-more-about-interconnections&quot;&gt;that many northern states heavily depend on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Why don&#39;t we start there? With regard to Western Canada and oil and gas, I think that is something that we should indicate is on the table.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herman points out that unless the U.S. exempts crude oil from any general tariff on Canadian imports, Canadian action would be moot anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We don&#39;t have to even think about [crude] export restraints or export restrictions in that context,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herman says tariffs on potash, critical minerals, steel and aluminum&amp;nbsp;would also put pressure on the new administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Those are things that U.S. industries integrated with Canadian producers have come to rely on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Price of gas more important than price of eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the icon of inflationary discontent in the recent U.S. election was the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/op-ed/article295975299.html&quot; href=&quot;https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/op-ed/article295975299.html&quot;&gt;price of eggs&lt;/a&gt;, the price that has long been considered the most &quot;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-07/falling-pump-prices-dampen-trump-s-inflation-attacks-on-harris?embedded-checkout=true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-07/falling-pump-prices-dampen-trump-s-inflation-attacks-on-harris?embedded-checkout=true&quot;&gt;visible&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and politically influential is the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://apnorc.org/projects/inflation-and-gas-prices-top-the-list-of-the-publics-priorities/&quot; href=&quot;https://apnorc.org/projects/inflation-and-gas-prices-top-the-list-of-the-publics-priorities/&quot;&gt;price of gas&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;at the pumps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Stanford University&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/presidential-approval-and-gas-prices-sociotropic-or-pocketbook-in&quot; href=&quot;https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/presidential-approval-and-gas-prices-sociotropic-or-pocketbook-in&quot;&gt;tracked&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;30 years of polling and found that a U.S. president, on average, loses 0.6 per cent&amp;nbsp;of approval for each dime of increase in a gallon of gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That effect continued to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/crude-oil/062624-us-elections-gasoline-price-fluctuations-could-play-role-in-2024-presidential-election&quot; href=&quot;https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/crude-oil/062624-us-elections-gasoline-price-fluctuations-could-play-role-in-2024-presidential-election&quot;&gt;2024 election&lt;/a&gt;, with three of every 10 battleground-state voters citing gas prices as their top priority. When gas prices rise, consumer confidence&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/25/upshot/gas-prices-biden-midterms.html&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/25/upshot/gas-prices-biden-midterms.html&quot;&gt;falls&lt;/a&gt;, as does the proportion of voters who say the country is on the right track.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that means that Canada could potentially put a political squeeze on a Trump administration that enters office with thin Congressional majorities, and is already thinking about the 2026 midterms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key question is whether Canada has the leverage to increase costs to U.S. consumers enough to make them howl to their elected representatives. Could refiners not simply replace Canadian imports with crude from other countries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer that question, it&#39;s important to understand how the U.S. refining industry came to rely on Canadian crude in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A mismatch of oilfields and refineries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key fact is that, while the country is vulnerable to a cutoff of Canadian oil, that isn&#39;t because it doesn&#39;t produce enough oil for its own needs. It produces more than it needs, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=727&amp;amp;t=6&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=727&amp;amp;t=6&quot;&gt;is a net exporter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem for the U.S. arises when it comes to turning all that crude oil production into usable gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are about 130 refineries in the U.S., capable of refining over 18 million barrels of oil a day, but there is a mismatch between those refineries and the kind of oil the U.S. produces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the 1980s and &#39;90s, there were widespread fears that oil was running out. U.S. production was falling, and so the&amp;nbsp;refining industry redesigned itself to be able to process Latin American oil, coming principally from Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela has the world&#39;s largest known oil reserves, much of it bitumen-heavy crude that is hard to refine and hard to drive through a pipeline unless diluted, just like the oil in Alberta&#39;s oilsands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in the early part of this century, new technologies such as horizontal drilling caused a U.S. oil boom in Texas fields such as the Permian and Eagle Ford, and in North Dakota&#39;s Bakken. The &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;shale oil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; produced in these fields is lighter and &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;sweeter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; (less sulphurous) than Venezuelan or Canadian crude, and therefore theoretically easier to refine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many refineries had already invested in expensive technologies designed to handle heavy crude, and their business model depended on the price discount that they demand for such oil, which sells for several dollars less than a barrel of light, sweet crude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, much of that U.S. shale oil began to be exported to refineries overseas that were better suited to handle it. U.S. crude oil exports have soared from less than a million barrels a month in 2009 to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;amp;s=MCREXUS1&amp;amp;f=M&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;amp;s=MCREXUS1&amp;amp;f=M&quot;&gt;well over 100 million barrels&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;a month today, while the U.S. has continued to import foreign heavy oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Venezuela out, Canada in&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of the Chavez regime in Venezuela in 1999, which caused an exodus of petroleum engineers and a steep fall in oil production, set back the U.S. refining industry&#39;s long-term plans. Fortunately, Canadian oilsands production was ramping up at the same time Venezuela&#39;s was declining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next quarter-century would see a proliferation of pipelines and transportation networks designed to refine heavy Canadian crude in the U.S. Many Midwestern and western refineries in particular depend exclusively on Canadian imports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were Canada to close or tighten the taps, or simply increase the price, those refineries could theoretically source similar heavy oil from other suppliers. But in practice, both political and economic considerations would make that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-premiers-trudeau-meeting-trump-tariffs-1.7431085&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-premiers-trudeau-meeting-trump-tariffs-1.7431085&quot;&gt;Ford says Canada must come first as Smith breaks with premiers on Trump retaliation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2022, the U.S. government eased sanctions on Venezuela, and Chevron returned to the country. But that relaxation was contingent on Nicolas Maduro allowing democratic elections. The Biden administration began to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10715&quot; href=&quot;https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10715&quot;&gt;withdraw licenses in 2024&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as it became apparent that Maduro did not intend to allow a free and fair vote and today, little oil is flowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump could potentially lift sanctions altogether, allowing Venezuelan crude to flow once again to U.S. refineries. But there&#39;s reason to believe he won&#39;t do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Florida resident, Trump understands the importance of &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;MAGA-zuelans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; and other anti-communist Latino voters to his winning coalition in the state. It&#39;s hard to imagine Trump&#39;s incoming secretary of state, Cuban-American Marco Rubio, would want to begin his tenure by lifting sanctions on the Maduro regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in any case, Venezuela&#39;s ramshackle industry is just a shadow of what it was before the socialist takeover — producing fewer than a million barrels a day total, much of which is already promised to China. It could never replace the four million barrels a day Canada exports to the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No viable alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombian heavy sour Castilla oil, or Mexican heavy sour Maya, can be refined in the same plants that handle Western Canadian crude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Colombian production just isn&#39;t big enough, and Mexico is moving forward with a strategic plan to refine&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;http://www.hydrocarbonprocessing.com/news/2024/12/mexicos-new-olmeca-refinery-operated-at-17-of-capacity-in-november/&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hydrocarbonprocessing.com/news/2024/12/mexicos-new-olmeca-refinery-operated-at-17-of-capacity-in-november/&quot;&gt;its heavy crude in its own plants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves sources like Russia and Iraq, both of which produce heavy crude. But while Trump might be only too happy to lift the price cap imposed on Russian oil as a punishment for the invasion of Ukraine, those countries suffer from another problem, one that affects all non-Canadian suppliers: how to get their oil to the U.S. refineries that can handle them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Gulf Coast refineries —&amp;nbsp;more accessible to seaborne tankers&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;do handle some Canadian crude, the refineries that really depend on Canadian imports are in the landlocked Midwest and Rocky Mountain states. They are deeply connected to Canadian oilfields by a fixed network of multi-billion-dollar pipelines that simply don&#39;t connect to Russia, Venezuela&amp;nbsp;or Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retooling not a good option&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But could U.S. refineries not simply retool in order to handle the light crude that&#39;s coming from their own shale oilfields? Couldn&#39;t they stop importing crude from Canada, and stop&amp;nbsp;sending their own domestic crude to refineries in Mexico, China and the Netherlands?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They could, but the cost would be extremely high, and the transportation problems —&amp;nbsp;though not as insurmountable as they would be sourcing crude overseas — would still be severe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a retooling would also take time, and likely not show results until long after the next U.S. midterms, so it would do little to stave off the political impact of Canadian action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Shale-Boom-Is-Over.html&quot; href=&quot;https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Shale-Boom-Is-Over.html&quot;&gt;many in the industry believe&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;the peak of the U.S. shale oil boom&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.desmog.com/2022/12/07/peak-us-oil-production-shale-boom-ends-bakken-permian/&quot; href=&quot;https://www.desmog.com/2022/12/07/peak-us-oil-production-shale-boom-ends-bakken-permian/&quot;&gt;is now passed&lt;/a&gt;. Few would wish to spend hundreds of millions retooling for a resource that is becoming scarcer, only to have to do it all over again when they inevitably go back to processing heavy oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions remain, though. A big one is: who would end up having to eat those losses? Would it be the U.S. refiners themselves? Would they pass on all of the costs to the American&amp;nbsp;consumer, as the Canadian government would hope? Or would they force the Canadian suppliers to lower their prices, since Canadian producers are also hostages of the same fixed transportation network, and would struggle to find other markets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cgai.ca/the_co_evolution_of_the_canada_us_oil_industry_and_possible_implications_of_donald_trumps_reelection&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cgai.ca/the_co_evolution_of_the_canada_us_oil_industry_and_possible_implications_of_donald_trumps_reelection&quot;&gt;analysts believe&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that all three would end up sharing the cost, and past experience has shown that a 20 per cent&amp;nbsp;increase in cost at the refinery level typically translates to about a 10 per cent increase at the retail pumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of those considerations are at play as Canadian politicians ponder their nuclear option, along with the concerns about national unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even though the cost would be high, says Herman, the threat should stay on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Trump is threatening the Canadian economy and Canadian livelihood, and in effect threatening Canada as a country. And we have to respond accordingly,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It&#39;s very hard to orchestrate something where the pain or the difficulties are felt equally across the country. Some regions, some sectors, may feel the pain more than others. But as Doug Ford rightly said, we&#39;ve got to deal with this as a national matter, as something that affects Canada as a whole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a remote Ontario peat bog may not be the stage that first comes to mind when picturing the geopolitical conflict, the critical minerals beneath it are essential to renewable energy and digital technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northern Ontario&#39;s Ring of Fire is a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ont-ring-of-fire-1.6991468&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ont-ring-of-fire-1.6991468&quot;&gt;crescent-shaped mineral deposit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that has been eyed as a critical source for Ontario&#39;s burgeoning electric vehicle battery industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Donald Trump&amp;nbsp;is now eyeing Canada&#39;s rich mineral deposits as America can&#39;t produce enough of its own, said Elizabeth Steyn, an assistant law professor at the University of Calgary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ring of Fire contains minerals including nickel, chromium, palladium and platinum, said Steyn, who teaches a course on critical minerals, regulatory frameworks and geopolitics. These minerals are highly appealing to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;They are important in terms of not only the energy transition, but the digital transition and also national security,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Steyn said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the trade war between Canada and the U.S. heats up, Trump&#39;s choice of what to tariff shows how much the U.S. relies on Canadian critical minerals, she said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;While the tariffs are at 25 per cent, energy is being assessed at 10 per cent and energy materials include critical minerals. Now that tells us a story, because if they didn&#39;t really need them, they would have been tariffing them at 25 per cent as well,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Steyn.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The growing &#39;race&#39; for resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journalist Vince Beiser has dug into the critical minerals race in his new book, &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Power Metal: The Race for the Resources That Will Shape the Future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Echoing former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Beiser said&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-trump-economy-summit-1.7452748&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-trump-economy-summit-1.7452748&quot;&gt;Trump&#39;s threat to annex Canada is motivated by his desire for critical minerals.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Canada is loaded with these critical metals that are going to be absolutely crucial for the next 20, 50, 100 years of human development,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Beiser said.&lt;/p&gt;

Here&#39;s why they&#39;re the lifeblood of the new tech era&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these coveted minerals are, so far, only a promise of the Ring of Fire&#39;s potential. The 5,000-square-kilometre area is a remote, swampy peatland about 500 kilometres northeast of Thunder Bay. Without a connection to the provincial highway network, it&#39;s only accessible by ice road in the winter&amp;nbsp;or plane in the remaining months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is Trump really coming after Canada for its critical minerals? | About That&lt;/p&gt;

Andrew Chang explains why they&#39;re so attractive to the U.S., and how China is raising the stakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The department store, which holds the title of Canada&#39;s oldest company, says it has been forced toward a full liquidation because &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;exhaustive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; efforts haven&#39;t turned up the financing it needs to keep at least some of its empire alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the company&#39;s financial situation, it wants to conclude the liquidation process by June 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it says it remains optimistic it can drum up capital and find a solution with key stakeholders, particularly its landlord partners, to avoid a full shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an application to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Hudson&#39;s Bay said it was struggling because of subdued consumer spending, trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada, and post-pandemic drops in downtown store traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

Canadian officials say they have a clearer idea</title><description>&lt;p&gt;After a lengthy meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump&#39;s top trade officials on Thursday, Canadian representatives say they have a clearer understanding of the rationale behind Trump&#39;s insistence on tariffs — not just on Canada but on the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Tariffs are now a global policy of the United States,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said David Paterson, Ontario&#39;s representative in Washington. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;And this is a historic change to global trading patterns, and [the Americans are] very aware of that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paterson, along with Ontario Premier Doug Ford, Canada&#39;s ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, and federal cabinet ministers, met with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer — the point people on Trump&#39;s trade agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-ontario-tariff-meeting-washington-1.7483312&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-ontario-tariff-meeting-washington-1.7483312&quot;&gt;Ford, feds say they had &#39;productive&#39; meeting with top Trump trade official in Washington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview on&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Power &amp;amp; Politics&lt;/em&gt;, Paterson told host David Cochrane&amp;nbsp;that the Canadians and Americans had a 90-minute meeting and the first half-hour was &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;a master class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; from Lutnick in breaking down the U.S. position on tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus of the U.S. government is dealing with its yearly deficit in federal spending, Paterson said. According to the U.S. Treasury Department, the federal government&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-deficit/&quot; href=&quot;https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-deficit/&quot;&gt;ran a $1.83 trillion US&amp;nbsp;deficit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in the 2024 fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three things the U.S. government is doing that affect&amp;nbsp;the deficit, Paterson added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/mike-johnson-budget-resolution-vote.html&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/mike-johnson-budget-resolution-vote.html&quot;&gt;major budget resolution&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that calls for trillions of dollars in spending and tax cuts, which is &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;something that must not increase that deficit further while keeping tax levels and competitiveness low,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Paterson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other two are measures to help make the spending and tax cuts happen without growing the deficit, including slashing government spending through&amp;nbsp;Elon&amp;nbsp;Musk&#39;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;http://doge.gov/&quot; href=&quot;http://doge.gov/&quot;&gt;Department of Government Efficiency&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and tariffs, which are meant to be a new revenue source and attract investment into the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paterson said the American plan is to impose tariffs by sector across countries all around the world on April 2. From there, the countries that get along with the U.S. the best will be &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;first in line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; to adjust or mitigate the tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;This is the policy. This is the way they&#39;re going forward,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Paterson said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;And I think [Thursday] gave us a lot of clarity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview on&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Rosemary Barton Live&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;airing Sunday, Hillman, Canada&#39;s ambassador to the U.S.,&amp;nbsp;said the Americans walked the Canadians through Trump&#39;s trade agenda and gave them a chance to ask questions and explain how Trump&#39;s trade disruptions are hurting the Canadian economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hillman described the meeting as &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;concrete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; and appreciated the conversations, but she noted that nothing changed in terms of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-retaliatory-tariffs-1.7481258&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-retaliatory-tariffs-1.7481258&quot;&gt;ongoing trade war&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;between Canada and the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The ambassador told host Rosemary Barton that the Americans know Canada will respond to Trump&#39;s tariffs on April 2 and that Trump&#39;s team is &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;deeply focused&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; on that deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It&#39;s the rest of the world that is going to now be brought into their plan. And that is [the Americans&#39;] singular focus,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Hillman said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;After that happens, then we&#39;ll see what they think the next step might be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Thursday meeting,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-ontario-tariff-meeting-washington-1.7483312&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-ontario-tariff-meeting-washington-1.7483312&quot;&gt;Ford told reporters&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;he feels like &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;the temperature is being lowered, the temperature&#39;s coming down&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; after the bilateral talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;This, I can honestly say, was the best meeting I&#39;ve ever had coming down here. We want the best outcome for both countries. We&#39;re like a family — sometimes there&#39;s tension between families, but that was an extremely productive meeting. I&#39;m feeling positive,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; the premier&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Canada-U.S. tariffs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government announced a plan on Wednesday to slap tariffs on $29.8 billion worth of American goods to hit back against Trump after he imposed punishing tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominic LeBlanc, who was serving as finance minister at the time of the announcement, said Canada &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;will not stand idly by while our iconic steel and aluminum industries are being unfairly targeted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeBlanc said the American products being hit with these tariffs include U.S.-made steel and aluminum, computers, sports equipment and certain cast iron products, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--body:attachment:1--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada announces $29.8 billion in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc outlines the federal government’s plan to slap tariffs on $29.8 billion worth of American goods to hit back against U.S. President Donald Trump after he imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump&#39;s tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, which took effect just after midnight Wednesday, are separate from the other tariffs Trump levied on Canada last week — and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-trump-trade-war-deal-1.7476311&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-trump-trade-war-deal-1.7476311&quot;&gt;later partially dialled back&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;— to supposedly pressure the country to do more at the border on drugs and migrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada immediately levied tariffs on $30 billion worth of American goods in response to those initial tariffs — and didn&#39;t take them off even after Trump rejigged his tariff regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told,&amp;nbsp;Canada is applying a 25 per cent tariff to some $60 billion worth of American goods as payback for both Trump&#39;s border- and metals-related tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It is more important than ever for Canada to strengthen its ties with its reliable allies, such as France,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Carney said in French before meeting with Macron in Paris.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Describing Canada as the &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;most European of non-European countries,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Carney told Macron he is&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;determined, like you, to maintain the most positive possible relations with the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We must strengthen our diplomatic ties to address a world that is increasingly unstable and dangerous,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he added. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Canada is a reliable, trustworthy and strong partner of France, which shares our values and lives them through action, during this age of economic and geopolitical crisis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Carney&#39;s first official foreign trip since he was sworn in on March 14. He will next land in London where he will sit down with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and King Charles. Carney will also stop in&amp;nbsp;Iqaluit on his way home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;|&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canada must strengthen ties with reliable allies like France, Carney says:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada must strengthen ties with reliable allies like France, Carney says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Mark Carney, appearing alongside French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Monday, said Canada and France must strengthen their ties, adding that &#39;Canada is a reliable, trustworthy and strong partner of France.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macron said the diplomatic relationship with Canada supports the values both countries hold dear, such as the defence of democracy and the &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;development for fair trade and protection of the planet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We believe that fair trade that respects international rules is a good thing for everyone&#39;s prosperity,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Macron said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It&#39;s far more effective than tariffs that simply create inflation and destroy the integration of our economies and our supply chains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We are receiving you and welcoming you as a friend&amp;nbsp;with great joy and forming of a lot of ambition and many projects together,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he added.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why France?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carney has deliberately chosen the two European capital cities that shaped Canada&#39;s early existence. During his swearing-in ceremony, he noted the country was built on the bedrock of three peoples — French, English and Indigenous — and said Canada is fundamentally different from America and will &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;never, ever, in any way, shape or form, be part of the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Trump came to office, he has imposed whopping tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum and repeatedly commented on turning Canada into the 51st state, infuriating Canadians and sparking a call to boycott U.S. products across the country. He is threatening to impose tariffs on all Canadian products on April 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, a senior Canadian government official briefed reporters on the plane before picking up Carney in Montreal, saying the purpose of the trip is to double down on partnerships with London and Paris. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as he is not allowed to speak publicly, said Canada is a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;good friend of the United States, but we all know what is going on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:1--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carney visited the Notre-Dame Cathedral before meeting with Macron at the Palais de l&#39;Élysée. However, Macron isn&#39;t expected to hold a joint news conference with Carney, a sign the French president might not want to upset Trump by siding with Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before returning to Ottawa on Tuesday, Carney will travel to Iqaluit to &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;reaffirm Canada&#39;s Arctic security and sovereignty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The choice of this itinerary for Prime Minister Carney&#39;s first official trip emphasizes the strong connection of Canada with the Arctic as well as with the two former colonial powers Canada remains attached to, through the Commonwealth on the U.K. side and La Francophonie on the France side,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Daniel Beland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The fact that Canada never broke away from the U.K. in a violent fashion is a key historical and institutional difference between the United States and Canada, a constitutional monarchy rather than a republic that has adopted and retained a U.K.-style parliamentary system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip to London will be a bit of a homecoming, as Carney became the first non-British governor in the Bank of England&#39;s 319-year history when he took over the top job on July 1, 2013. He served until March 15, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Washington trip planned&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carney, a former central banker who turned 60 on Sunday, has said he&#39;s ready to meet with Trump if he shows respect for Canadian sovereignty. He said he doesn&#39;t plan to visit Washington at the moment but hopes to have a phone call with the president soon. His government is also reviewing the purchase of U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets in light of Trump&#39;s trade war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Macron has been ramping up efforts to persuade France&#39;s allies to move away from purchases of American military hardware, which dovetails with Canada&#39;s rethink on F-35s and also coincides with mounting questions and concerns in Europe that European defences are overly dependent on U.S. weaponry, technical support and goodwill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carney spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on a call late Sunday and invited him to the G7 summit this summer, which Canada is hosting. Trump said he would speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday as he pushes to end the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carney is expected to call an election by the end of the week, to take place in late April or early May. The Liberal Party had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared economic war. Now, the party and its new leader could come out on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being sworn in on Friday, Carney&#39;s cabinet ended the tax through what&#39;s known as&amp;nbsp;an order-in-council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former prime minister Justin Trudeau first implemented the carbon pricing scheme in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

Who&#39;s on their way out?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as Canadians experienced high inflation in the years following, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre&#39;s pledge to &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;axe the tax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; gained traction among voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carney had previously supported a carbon pricing scheme, but said during his bid for the Liberal leadership that the current policy had become &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;too divisive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; and promised to kill the policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was designed as a financial incentive for people and businesses to change their behaviour to burn less fossil fuel and transition to greener forms of energy, thus helping Canada lower its emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help offset costs, rebates were offered to residents in provinces where the policy applied.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An industrial carbon tax on large emitters remains in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former trucker Gurpreet Singh — accused of helping to co-ordinate cocaine shipments from California to Canada on behalf of Wedding&#39;s alleged crime ring — appeared for a bail hearing in a downtown Toronto court Friday. He faces extradition to the U.S., where prosecutors want him to stand trial on drug-related charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wedding, who competed for Canada as a snowboarder at the 2002 Olympic Games in Utah, was&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ryan-wedding-most-wanted-1.7476637&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ryan-wedding-most-wanted-1.7476637&quot;&gt;named last week&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;one of the FBI&#39;s 10 most-wanted fugitives. Authorities are offering a $10-million US reward for information leading to his arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court on Friday, defence lawyer Peter Thorning raised the prospect that U.S. authorities&#39; case against Singh could be &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;undermined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; now that the FBI&#39;s main witness in the investigation will no longer be testifying.&amp;nbsp;He said Canadian authorities have not provided a reason for the change of plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The witness, a former drug trafficker-turned-informant, was first&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/key-witness-in-fbi-cocaine-case-against-canadian-ex-olympian-ryan-wedding-is-assassinated-in/article_3d612e86-e30a-11ef-9b24-5f013b39461a.html&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/key-witness-in-fbi-cocaine-case-against-canadian-ex-olympian-ryan-wedding-is-assassinated-in/article_3d612e86-e30a-11ef-9b24-5f013b39461a.html&quot;&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;by the Toronto Star as Canadian-Colombian Jonathan Acebedo-Garcia. A longtime associate of Wedding, court records suggest the two first met when they were both incarcerated in Texas more than a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Colombian media reports, Acebedo-Garcia was gunned down in a Medellin restaurant in January before he could testify in the sprawling FBI case against Wedding and his associates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a summary of U.S. evidence filed in Ontario Superior Court, the witness met with Singh and his uncle and co-accused, Hardeep Ratte, at a Toronto-area auto body shop as part of the FBI&#39;s investigation. At the meeting —&amp;nbsp;which prosecutors said was recorded —&amp;nbsp;Singh and Ratte allegedly agreed to transport bulk quantities of cocaine on behalf of Wedding&#39;s network.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH: Ryan Wedding&#39;s path from Olympian to most-wanted fugitive:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan Wedding’s path from Olympian to most-wanted fugitive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan Wedding once represented Canada as an Olympic snowboarder; now he’s accused of being a drug kingpin and is on the FBI’s most wanted list — with a $10 million US reward being offered for information leading to his arrest. CBC’s Thomas Daigle traces his shocking path from the top of the slopes to the underworld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;This is a case involving a single eyewitness to the most important piece of evidence in this case, which is the meeting,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Thorning told Superior Court Justice Michael Dineen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors have warned against granting bail to Singh, one of Wedding&#39;s four co-defendants in custody in Ontario. They suggested in a recent letter submitted to the Ontario court that Singh, 31, poses a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;substantial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; flight risk, and that a recent kidnapping incident suggests he and his girlfriend owe a debt to Wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Wedding should not be granted access to an additional loyalist through the release of Singh on bail,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Los Angeles-based assistant U.S. attorneys Maria Jhai and Lyndsi Allsop recently wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the prosecutors, Wedding took credit for negotiating Singh&#39;s release last summer, after the Brampton, Ont.-born man was kidnapped by cartel members in Sinaloa, Mexico, over a $600,000 drug debt.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh&#39;s lawyer, Thorning said Friday he would not comment on all the &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;wild statements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; before the court. But he insisted Singh does not pose a flight risk and should be released on bail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;There&#39;s no evidence of any ability to flee,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Thorning said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, Singh testified from the witness box, speaking softly —&amp;nbsp;sometimes making it hard to hear from the public gallery — in a grey blazer and navy turtleneck. He said he&#39;s made no income since his dump truck business went bankrupt in 2021.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked by federal Crown counsel Kiran Gill about several lengthy stints abroad — including weeks or months at a time spent in the United Arab Emirates, Colombia and Mexico — Singh described them as business trips for his girlfriend, with all expenses covered by her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;She was looking for more locations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; for the Toronto brunch restaurant she owns, Singh testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court records, the FBI&#39;s key witness also flew to meet with Singh last year in Dubai. U.S. prosecutors allege Singh has &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;extensive organized crime connections within Dubai, including relationships with members of the Kinahan gang, which is a well-known, violent organized crime group operating throughout the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singh is also alleged to have been involved in a scheme to ship stolen high-end cars to Dubai through the port of Montreal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toronto police arrested Singh in October on the 34th floor of the five-star St. Regis Hotel. He told court he&#39;d been living there with his girlfriend and that she covered rent payments. The woman sat silently in the courtroom for Singh&#39;s testimony.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His bail hearing continues Friday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The documents were submitted as part of its creditor protection filing last week. The company owes a total of $950 million to nearly 2,000 secured and unsecured creditors, including well-known&amp;nbsp;apparel and beauty&amp;nbsp;brands like Adidas Canada, Estée Lauder, L&#39;Oréal Canada, Levi Strauss Canada, Michael Kors Canada, Nike Canada and&amp;nbsp;Ralph Lauren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also owes more than $1 million&amp;nbsp;to Canada Post, and is in debt to over&amp;nbsp;a dozen municipalities.&amp;nbsp;The list doesn&#39;t include debts owed to government agencies, a figure that the filing says is unknown at this time. The amount owed to employees is to be determined, per the filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, Hudson&#39;s Bay had just&amp;nbsp;$3 million in cash and cash equivalents, the documents show. The secured debt it owes includes $724.4 million in mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bay announced last week that it was seeking creditor protection, with its chief executive pointing to the COVID-19 pandemic and an ongoing trade war with the U.S. as external factors that have put financial pressure on the company.&lt;/p&gt;

Here&#39;s what you need to know&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts say that Hudson&#39;s Bay had been in decline long before then, some tracing its issues back to its 2008 acquisition by&amp;nbsp;the American investment firm NRDC Equity Partners, and saying that the company&#39;s new ownership prioritized its real estate over a cohesive retail strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#39;s lack of investment in its stores became evident in recent years,&amp;nbsp;with floors understaffed, escalators and elevators in disrepair&amp;nbsp;and faulty HVAC systems leading&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;temporary closures last summer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;What I said to the secretary is Canada&#39;s sovereignty is not up to debate, period,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she said at the closing press conference of the G7 foreign ministers meeting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;There&#39;s no argument, there&#39;s no conversation about it, there&#39;s no need to talk about it,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;You&#39;re here, you respect us, you respect our sovereignty, you&#39;re in our country, you respect our people. Period.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joly made the remarks a day after U.S. President Donald Trump repeated his call for Canada to join the United States, saying his country does not need anything Canada has to sell.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Canada only works as a state,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Trump said at the White House. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We don&#39;t need anything they have. As a state it would be one of the great states … if you look at a map they drew an artificial line right through it … a straight artificial line … makes no sense.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Canada’s sovereignty is not up to debate. Period,’ Joly to U.S. secretary of state&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly, speaking to reporters in Quebec in her final news conference of the G7 foreign ministers&#39; meeting, said she told U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio to respect Canada and its sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joly said her counterparts in the G7 arrived in Canada for the summit with the impression that Trump&#39;s talk of Canada becoming the 51st state was something to be &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;taken in a humorous way,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; but she quickly set them straight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I said to them this is not a joke. Canadians are anxious. Canadians are proud people and you are here in a sovereign country and so therefore we don&#39;t expect this to be even discussed, or clearly not laughed at,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joly said Canada was created &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;because we didn&#39;t want to be part of the United States,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; but also because we wanted to be closer to each other than we are to the Americans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The future of Canadian trade&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, Joly said that in order to soften the blow of tariffs being imposed on Canada, the provinces need to &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;get rid of internal commercial barriers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; to boost the flow of interprovincial trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;There are lots of opportunities in Canada to be able to work amongst each other, to be able to be closer from one province to another,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joly also said that Canada will seek to build stronger trading relationships with countries other than the U.S.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Canada wants to foster new partnerships in the world, we want to be closer to Europe, we want to be closer to Britain,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We need to diversify our economy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the issue of Ukraine, Joly&amp;nbsp;said the G7 is united in supporting a U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal for the country, which has been endorsed by Kyiv and is now awaiting a response from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comments Friday morning, Joly said&amp;nbsp;the international community is closely watching Moscow&#39;s reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on Friday, Trump said there is a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;very good chance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; the war between Russia and Ukraine can end after productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Trump said in a Truth Social post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump said he&amp;nbsp;had requested that Putin spare the lives of &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;completely surrounded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Ukrainian troops in Kursk, Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Justin Trudeau era is officially over after nine-plus years, the Carney one has just begun and the new prime minister&#39;s cabinet picks reflect that transfer of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighteen Trudeau government cabinet ministers are not returning to cabinet, either because they have decided not to run in the next election or because Carney replaced them with someone else as he put together a much smaller cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carney dropped some Trudeau stalwarts altogether&amp;nbsp;from this new 24-member transition cabinet, including Jean-Yves Duclos, Karina Gould, Mark Holland, Marc Miller&amp;nbsp;and Diane Lebouthillier, while others, like new Transport Minister Chrystia Freeland, have been demoted to arguably more junior roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s also dropped Freeland&#39;s old job, deputy prime minister, altogether&amp;nbsp;— there won&#39;t be one in this ministry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s still&amp;nbsp;considerable overlap with Trudeau&#39;s last cabinet. Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly stays&amp;nbsp;where she&amp;nbsp;is, as does Jonathan Wilkinson at Natural Resources, and Dominic LeBlanc will retain the Canada-U.S. file as Carney&#39;s new international trade minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carney&#39;s team says that&#39;s because he wants some continuity in key files as the country grapples with a series of acute challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cabinet-carney-transition-1.7482507&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cabinet-carney-transition-1.7482507&quot;&gt;Freeland to be transport minister, Guilbeault&amp;nbsp;Quebec lieutenant in Carney cabinet: sources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-farewell-video-1.7482823&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-farewell-video-1.7482823&quot;&gt;Trudeau says he&#39;s &#39;proud of Canadians&#39; in video posted on his last full day in office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Promotions, demotions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;François-Philippe Champagne, who has also been active on Canada&#39;s plan to fight back against U.S. President Donald Trump, gets a promotion and will&amp;nbsp;become Carney&#39;s finance minister. Anita Anand takes over Champagne&#39;s old job as minister of Innovation, Science and Industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Guilbeault, an ardent defender of the carbon tax, is out as the environment minister and will take on a different job: minister of Canadian Culture and Identity. He will also serve as Carney&#39;s Quebec lieutenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some new ministers who were only sworn in late last year after&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-faces-frustrated-mps-after-chrystia-freeland-s-shock-resignation-1.7411380&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-faces-frustrated-mps-after-chrystia-freeland-s-shock-resignation-1.7411380&quot;&gt;Freeland&#39;s shock resignation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;are also staying on, including Public Safety Minister David McGuinty and Nate Erskine-Smith as Housing minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three new faces are stepping into the spotlight as new cabinet ministers. London-area MP Arielle Kayabaga becomes the government House leader, Toronto MP Ali Ehsassi is the new Public Services and Procurement minister and Nova Scotia MP Kody Blois will serve as the Agriculture minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carney himself, of course, never sat in Trudeau&#39;s cabinet, which was part of his appeal to some Liberal voters who wanted a clean break from the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carney&#39;s smaller cabinet is not gender equal — there are 13 men and 11 women, including Carney&amp;nbsp;— and some provinces don&#39;t have a minister around the table, including Alberta, P.E.I.&amp;nbsp;and Saskatchewan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cabinet rebrand is Carney&#39;s chance to show the voting public he&#39;s his own man, especially as the opposition Conservatives try to paint his team as the new face of the &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Trudeau-Carney Liberals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; to try and tie the new PM to the old one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carney has a very narrow window before an expected federal election to convince&amp;nbsp;Canadians he has the best plan for the country as it stares down Trump&#39;s 51st state taunts and tariff threats — or he risks leading one of the shortest governments in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carney has touted his experience as a central banker through the Great Recession — and, after being poached by the Bank of England, Brexit — as proof he&#39;s the best choice for the tumultuous times ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he has also faced pointed questions about his business experience — Brookfield, a company he chaired,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mark-carney-brookfield-1.7469116&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mark-carney-brookfield-1.7469116&quot;&gt;moved its head office from Toronto to New York&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;— and whether he&#39;s serious about dumping the consumer carbon tax, a policy the Conservatives have made the centrepiece of their campaign to unseat the Liberals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The G7 foreign ministers met in the remote tourist town of La Malbaie, Que., this week. In comments Friday morning, Joly said the international community is closely watching Moscow&#39;s reaction.

&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada announces $29.8 billion in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc outlines the federal government’s plan to slap tariffs on $29.8 billion worth of American goods to hit back against U.S. President Donald Trump after he imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc, the government&#39;s point person on Canada-U.S. relations, said Trump&#39;s attack on Canadian industry is &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;unjustified and unjustifiable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; and the government must retaliate as the U.S. inserts &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;disruption and disorder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; into what was once one of the most successful trading relationships in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We will not stand idly by while our iconic steel and aluminum industries are being unfairly targeted,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 30-second video posted to X, Trudeau says he&#39;s proud to have served a country full of people who stand up for what&#39;s right, rise to every occasion and &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;always have each others&#39; backs when it matters most.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberal Leader Mark Carney will be sworn in as Canada&#39;s 24th prime minister at a ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa on Friday after Trudeau&#39;s formal resignation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trudeau says that while this may be his last day in the job, he will always be &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;boldly and unapologetically Canadian.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says his only wish is that, no matter what the world throws at Canadians, they will &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;always be the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trudeau is leaving office after more than nine years as prime minister and does not plan to run again in his Montreal riding when the next election is called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada, meet good cop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At his U.S. Senate confirmation hearing for ambassador to Canada, Pete Hoekstra steered clear of annexation talk and saluted the countries&#39; long-standing partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was peppered with questions from Democrats about what they described as disrespectful language from Trump that&#39;s poisoned an old alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president keeps calling for Canada to join the U.S., and in fact did so, again, on Thursday, a timely reminder of the diplomatic reality awaiting Hoekstra. At one point in the confirmation hearing, Trump&#39;s annexation talk came up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Artificially drawn line’: The border and Trump’s plan for Canada&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants Canada to be the 51st state and has reportedly questioned the validity of the border citing a little-known 1908 treaty. CBC&#39;s Eli Glasner breaks down the latest threats with experts who compare Trump&#39;s strategy to a game of Risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Would you agree that Canada is a sovereign state and should not even jokingly be referred to as the 51st state?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Coons asked Hoekstra.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coons raised his fingers to make air quotes around the words&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;negotiation tactics,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; a reference to&amp;nbsp;the dominant view in Washington that Trump&#39;s talk is some sort of bargaining ploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoekstra concurred on Canada being independent. And he professed to be unaware of what the president is doing when he talks about making Canada a state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He appeared to suggest it might have been intended to needle Canada&#39;s outgoing prime minister, Justin Trudeau, but said he wasn&#39;t sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Canada is a sovereign state — yes,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; replied Hoekstra, a former congressman from Michigan, a former U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands&amp;nbsp;and a Trump campaign organizer.&lt;/p&gt;

Right?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The president and the relationship between the former prime minister in Canada, and the characteristics and nature of that relationship, I don&#39;t know, OK, [whether]&amp;nbsp;it&#39;s humour,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that Trump was simply needling Trudeau is undermined by the fact that the U.S. president has kept making that comment. Even Thursday, Trump&amp;nbsp;said Canada would be a great additional state: &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Maybe our greatest state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the hearing, Democrats called for the president to cut it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coons said the annexation talk has to stop, as do the reported threats about kicking Canada out of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. With a new incoming prime minister in Canada, Coons said, there&#39;s an opportunity for a reset and he hoped Trump takes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of Democrats also ridiculed the president&#39;s initial justification for imposing tariffs: trade in fentanyl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoekstra acknowledged that the tensions have been on his mind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Great question. I&#39;ve obviously been spending a lot of time thinking about that myself,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Hoekstra said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;[About] having to go there and being kind of the tip of the spear myself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the U.S. has a great national security alliance with Canada, but that Canada should increase its defence spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His goal, he said, is even more co-operation — with freer trade&amp;nbsp;and fewer barriers, extending the countries&#39; long-standing ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We have co-operated with Canada on so many things,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said, listing the Great Lakes, trade, national security&amp;nbsp;and intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We have a great history of working together.

So that we can actually grow the business relationship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He noted that his parents came from the part of Holland liberated by Canadian soldiers during the Second World War, while mentioning his own personal history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also revealed that he had a good phone call with Joe Biden&#39;s ambassador to Canada, David Cohen, who pledged his help with the transition, should Hoekstra be confirmed by the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of people gathered on Parliament Hill Sunday to protest U.S. President Donald Trump&#39;s tariffs on Canadian goods and talk of Canada becoming the &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;51st state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; (Photo: Justin Tang/The Canadian Press)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoekstra&#39;s confirmation hearing took place Thursday on Capitol Hill in a meeting with two other witnesses:&amp;nbsp;Trump&#39;s nominees for ambassadors to Mexico and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Tim Kaine called it a rare event — a hearing involving three major allies. The Virginia Democrat said the U.S. is better off when it recognizes who its friends are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said they&#39;ll always have disagreements, but should be handled respectfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I&#39;m troubled by [Trump&#39;s] actions in the first couple of months. Some of which may be negotiation tactics,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Montreal MP and former Greenpeace activist, who has held the portfolio since 2021, will instead be responsible for various files, said the source, who was not authorized to speak on the record.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, he will no longer be the face of the fight against climate change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guilbeault learned the news earlier this week, the source said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada&#39;s next prime minister appears intent on marking a clear break with the Trudeau-era consumer carbon tax, a policy Guilbeault, until recently, aggressively defended. That made him a polarizing minister in parts of the country, and he often faced off against Alberta Premier Danielle Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carney, once a proponent of carbon pricing, campaigned on dropping the carbon tax and repeated the promise in his acceptance speech Monday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He endorsed Carney during the leadership race.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources with knowledge of Carney&#39;s plans have said he&#39;s aiming for a more svelte cabinet to confront the trade war launched by U.S. President Donald Trump and the ensuing economic uncertainty.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those sources said Carney&#39;s team will be in the range of 15 to 20 members —&amp;nbsp;paring down from the 37 ministers in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#39;s cabinet&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Hydro rebates in response to U.S. tariffs</title><description>&lt;p&gt;B.C. Hydro has excluded Tesla products from its electric vehicle charger rebate program in response to U.S. tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rebate program allows British Columbians to get up to $350 to purchase and install an EV charger in their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of March 12, Tesla chargers, energy storage batteries and inverters are not eligible for rebates, according to B.C. Hydro. Those who have purchased or received pre-approval for their Tesla products before March 12 can still qualify for rebates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesla owners caught up in Elon Musk controversies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing opposition to Elon Musk’s politics and his role in the U.S. government has Tesla owners caught in the middle, with some saying they’re embarrassed to be seen supporting a Musk brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the latest attempt to bolster the made-in-Canada movement in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump&#39;s tariffs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has previously suggested placing harsher restrictions on Tesla,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ndp-tesla-tariffs-1.7455273&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ndp-tesla-tariffs-1.7455273&quot;&gt;vowing in February&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to slap a 100 per cent trade tax on all Tesla products if his party formed government in the next election.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for that reason there is a palpable sense of dismay — even betrayal — among Canadian veterans toward&amp;nbsp;the Trump administration over its threats and treatment of not just Canada, but other allies such Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A meme circulating online — a photo of troops in front of the maple leaf rock monument at Ma&#39;sum Ghar, the Canadian forward operating base in western Kandahar — was recently captioned: &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We went because you were attacked. We didn&#39;t ask for your thanks. Neither did 158 of us who died for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion that Canadians fought and died in Afghanistan to help defend the United States — because of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001 — runs deep among Canadian veterans of that war and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-annexation-destabilizing-canada-1.7479890&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-annexation-destabilizing-canada-1.7479890&quot;&gt;AnalysisThe U.S. has covertly destabilized nations. With Canada, it&#39;s being done in public&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&#39;re irked by the threats of President Donald Trump to annex Canada through economic force and the&amp;nbsp;trade war. But it was the bullying of the Ukrainian president in the Oval Office and Vice-President JD Vance&#39;s insistence that&amp;nbsp;Volodymyr Zelenskyy&amp;nbsp;show gratitude that set&amp;nbsp;off many veterans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anger was perhaps felt more keenly on Wednesday, the 11th anniversary of Canada&#39;s military withdrawal from Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I think if 9/11 were to happen again, I honestly don&#39;t think I would be as willing — or ready — to help the Americans as I did in 2001,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said retired corporal Bruce Moncur, who was gravely wounded when an American ground attack jet accidentally strafed Canadian troops at the start of the milestone 2006 battle known as Operation Medusa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down the years Moncur has tried to come to peace with the horrific friendly fire incident that took the life of one Canadian soldier — Trooper Mark Anthony Graham — and wounded 36 others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the now outspoken veterans advocate said he can&#39;t help but wonder about the country and the people he willingly defended.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all of his conversations since Trump&#39;s return to the White House in January, Thompson said he never once got the sense that U.S. soldiers shared the sentiment that Canada should become the 51st state in the union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It&#39;s not about the United States Army or the United States Armed Forces. It&#39;s about the president of the United States,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Thompson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian special forces troops, whom Thompson also commanded, were among the first on the ground in Afghanistan in October 2001 along with their U.S. counterparts in the aftermath of the terror attacks on New York and Washington.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thompson said the ties between the two militaries run so deep that a U.S. Navy Seal — Senior Chief Petty Officer Thomas Ratzlaff — was awarded in 2010 Canada&#39;s second-highest military decoration for bravery while serving alongside Canadians.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over more than a dozen years in Afghanistan, 158 Canadian soldiers were killed, along with seven civilians. An additional 2,000 troops were wounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is one of the reasons Trump&#39;s annexation threats are tough for veterans to swallow, even though they know a full-blown invasion is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a possibility, militarily,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Thompson. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;He can certainly make an attempt to tank our economy. And I&#39;m not an economist, but I would suggest that Canadians will take an awful lot of pain before they acquiesce to his demands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canada-european-union-1.7446400&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canada-european-union-1.7446400&quot;&gt;AnalysisWith its U.S. alliance under pressure, could Canada join the EU?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he also doesn&#39;t believe that Trump has the support of the American public for his annexation agenda — beyond talking heads in the right-wing punditry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk of civil disobedience in the U.S. is increasing, said Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I think the United States will have internal problems long before they start turning their attention, before he can start to turn his attention towards actually annexing Canada,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leader of the U.K.&#39;s Liberal Democrats has bungee-jumped off a giant crane to rally voters, shovelled sheep manure on a Welsh farm to protest tax hikes for farmers and tumbled off a paddle board to underscore the risk of raw sewage in British waterways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now,&amp;nbsp;with U.S. President Donald Trump&#39;s tariff war in full flight,&amp;nbsp;Davey is trying to rally British voters to a new cause:&amp;nbsp;supporting Canada.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his latest political stunt, on Wednesday,&amp;nbsp;Davey burst through a Canada flag at a Canadian-themed pub in central London and invited local media to dine with him on a menu of Canadian poutine,&amp;nbsp;Beaver Tails and Canadian beer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I want to make sure that people know that British people stand with Canada,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;Davey told CBC News at the impromptu event at the Maple Leaf pub in Covent Garden.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;President Trump is behaving recklessly, irresponsibly and to treat Canada, one of its closest allies ... this way is beyond appalling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davey, 59,&amp;nbsp;led the Lib Dems, as they&#39;re known, to their best electoral showing in almost a century in last year&#39;s election,&amp;nbsp; winning 72 seats&amp;nbsp;and vaulting the party into a solid third place in Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His unconventional, attention-getting stunts were seen as one of the keys to getting voters to engage with the party&#39;s campaign.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I think if President Trump gets away with this type of behaviour, whether it&#39;s Canada or anyone else, frankly, it&#39;s going to harm everybody in the world,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Davey as he dug into a plate of poutine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I think we have to choose,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We have to be behind Canada.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Parliament,&amp;nbsp;Davey has repeatedly voiced support for Canada,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-trump-canada-uk-tariff-trade-commonwealth-b2691236.html&quot; href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-trump-canada-uk-tariff-trade-commonwealth-b2691236.html&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;referring&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to Trump as a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;playground bully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday,&amp;nbsp;Davey demanded British Prime Minister Keir Starmer immediately fly to Canada to stand in solidarity with its key Commonwealth partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his response,&amp;nbsp;Starmer demurred,&amp;nbsp;calling Canada &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;an important ally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; whilst emphasizing Britain&#39;s desire to negotiate an economic deal with Trump that avoids punitive trade measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump&#39;s 25 per cent tariffs on all U.S. steel and aluminum imports — including from Britain — kicked in on Wednesday. The measure could potentially affect roughly five per cent of British exports, making them more expensive for U.S. consumers, according to the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Starmer says he is holding off on any retaliation for the moment, the European Commission on Wednesday said it would impose counter-tariffs worth $28 billion US on many goods.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We&#39;re very keen to work with our European colleagues, but we&#39;re as keen to work with our Commonwealth colleagues, too,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Davey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;And I think there&#39;s strength in numbers and I think it sends a very, very big sign.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On his last overseas visit as prime minister, Justin Trudeau met with King Charles to discuss what was termed:&amp;nbsp;issues of &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;sovereignty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Charles has not spoken publicly about the friction between Canada and the U.S.,&amp;nbsp;British media reports have suggested the King is very concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/king-charles-soft-power-commonwealth-day-royal-pets-1.7477783&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/king-charles-soft-power-commonwealth-day-royal-pets-1.7477783&quot;&gt;Royal FascinatorA &#39;delicate situation&#39; for King Charles: Royal soft power and diplomacy in the face of world turmoil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of his recent public appearances,&amp;nbsp;Charles was seen wearing his Canadian medals on his military uniform;&amp;nbsp;he also planted a Canadian Maple Tree on the grounds of Buckingham Palace to celebrate Commonwealth environmental initiatives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, King Charles bestowed a ceremonial sword upon Gregory Peters,&amp;nbsp;Usher of the Black Rod of the Senate of Canada, according to a news release from Buckingham Palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at the ceremony at Westminster Abbey marking Commonwealth Day on Monday,&amp;nbsp;Catherine, the Princess of Wales, was dressed in red and white.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:1--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada&#39;s High Commissioner to Britain Ralph Goodale told CBC News he believes the shows of Canadiana were intentional and aimed at showing political support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Nothing happens by accident with the royal family,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still,&amp;nbsp;most of the support coming Canada&#39;s way has largely been symbolic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with Starmer&#39;s measured answer in Britain&#39;s parliament to Davey&#39;s question, many foreign leaders have been careful not to offend or alienate the unpredictable U.S. president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve been really impressed about the way the Canadian governments, whether it&#39;s Trudeau, and now Carney, have been strong against Trump,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;said Davey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for his first foray into Canadian poutine, Davey quipped that the fries smothered with gravy and cheese curds looked &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;super healthy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Who wouldn&#39;t want it,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he joked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I don&#39;t think friends do that to friends,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Alberta Energy Minister Brian Jean said, speaking onstage Tuesday during a panel discussion at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/bakx-duhatschek-ceraweek-oil-wright-1.7480061&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/bakx-duhatschek-ceraweek-oil-wright-1.7480061&quot;&gt;CERAWeek by S&amp;amp;P Global&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that also featured Ontario Energy Minister Stephen Lecce and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trio of politicians were at the conference as the tariff fight heated up then cooled off within the course of a couple of hours. Ontario Premier Doug Ford had promised a 25 per cent surcharge on electricity imports to the United States, U.S. President Donald Trump fired back with staggering tariffs on steel and aluminum, and ultimately&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-canada-steel-alumimum-tariffs-1.7480309&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-canada-steel-alumimum-tariffs-1.7480309&quot;&gt;both parties pulled back&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and agreed to talk it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this enough to make Lecce mad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, but he is &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;offended,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he told CBC News in an interview following the panel discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I think about my own dad who immigrated through Ellis Island, New York,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Lecce said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I mean, we are family and this is unjust.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terms &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; or &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;friends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; were alternately and repeatedly used onstage to describe the relationship between Canada and the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they agreed it&#39;s normal to have disagreements in close relationships, Moe said, the &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;tariffs and escalating counter-tariffs&amp;nbsp;[do] nothing to benefit the North American family.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the chaos was&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/financial-markets-wall-street-trump-tariffs-33b8562c7b76fe3b967ea6cd9d61719b&quot; href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/financial-markets-wall-street-trump-tariffs-33b8562c7b76fe3b967ea6cd9d61719b&quot;&gt;reflected in the stock market&lt;/a&gt;, where indexes plummeted on Tuesday before bouncing back slightly before the day&#39;s end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Wilkinson, Canada&#39;s energy and natural resources minister, who is also in Houston, struck a stern but polite tone about the tariff fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The people of Canada expected their government was going to step up and respond. They&#39;re not going to think their government is going to be a patsy and let the Americans do whatever they want,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-canada-steel-alumimum-tariffs-1.7480309&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-canada-steel-alumimum-tariffs-1.7480309&quot;&gt;Trump placing 25% tariff on steel, aluminum after backing off 50% threat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/bakx-duhatschek-ceraweek-oil-wright-1.7480061&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/bakx-duhatschek-ceraweek-oil-wright-1.7480061&quot;&gt;The U.S. is trying to achieve &#39;energy dominance.&#39; What does that mean for Canada?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Wilkinson met face to face with U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I think we both left understanding a little bit more of the perspectives of the other side, and I&#39;m hopeful that he will be a voice for trying to find ways to de-escalate and eventually get these tariffs removed,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Wilkinson&amp;nbsp;told CBC News, referring to&amp;nbsp;Wright&#39;s career in the oilpatch, including projects in Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House had previously announced a 10&amp;nbsp;per cent tariff on imports of Canadian energy. However there has been confusion among some industry officials and analysts after tariff exemptions were made for products compliant with the current free-trade deal between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. energy secretary was vague on the issue and would not provide details when pressed by reporters on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilkinson said on Tuesday that the bulk of Canadian oil and natural gas is now exempt from tariffs and also&amp;nbsp;suggested trade relations have actually improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Canada&#39;s never been more united: Lecce&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As negotiations continue, the politicians on the ground in Houston said the tariff fight has made the relationship between Canadians stronger than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lecce&amp;nbsp;said he&#39;d never before seen Canadians so united&amp;nbsp;and that the animosity with the U.S. has meant greater motivation to build new infrastructure and find new export markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We almost needed this kick in the butt as a nation to realize that we have mass potential,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in Texas, Lecce is meeting with his state-level counterparts in an effort to keep promoting the province&#39;s nuclear industry amid the federal-level tumult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there were limits to that united front. Asked about how Mark Carney, the new federal Liberal leader and prime minister-designate, might respond in this fight, Alberta energy minister Jean said Carney can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t do anything because he &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;has no mandate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Both prime ministers are lame ducks,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said, referring to Carney and outgoing prime minister Justin Trudeau.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ontario&#39;s Ford is set to meet with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Thursday to discuss trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Canadians wait and see how the situation unfurls, Lecce said he expects the country will act by breaking down interprovincial trade barriers, pursuing trade missions beyond North America and attempting to build the kind of major infrastructure projects that hearken back to the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;This is the moment for us to rise,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s how you can see it</title><description>&lt;p&gt;This week, robed in twilight, a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;blood worm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;will pierce the night sky. As ominous as that sounds, don&#39;t think leeches — think lunar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late Thursday night or Friday early morning, North Americans with clear skies can look up to see a full moon with a beautiful reddish hue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while it has that eerie nickname, it&#39;s not the only one, depending on different cultures.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;…Blood?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This event is actually two occurrences coming together: a total eclipse of the moon by the Earth at the same time as it goes through a full moon phase for March. It&#39;s not too rare for this to happen.&amp;nbsp;The last March total lunar eclipse&amp;nbsp;was in 1978, according to NASA&amp;nbsp;— though much of North America couldn&#39;t see it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;blood&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; part is from the eclipse. When the Earth passes in front of the moon, it obscures the sun&#39;s light from hitting it — but some still sneaks through. To understand why the moon turns that colour, amateur astronomer Dave Chapman says you have to imagine you&#39;re an astronaut on the moon during the eclipse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The sun is shining on the Earth from behind. It&#39;s being backlit,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; explains Chapman, a fellow at the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The Earth&#39;s face will be dark, but along the edge — where the atmosphere is — there is sunlight filtering through.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that light comes from all the parts of the world that are experiencing sunrises or sunsets. As light during those times are more red and orange, this is the hue that hits the moon and reflects back to us.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it&#39;s not always blood red. Its variations, from totally invisible to copper, are measured in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/Danjon.html&quot; href=&quot;https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/Danjon.html&quot;&gt;Danjon scale&lt;/a&gt;. We won&#39;t know where this particular eclipse rates on that scale until after it happens.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapman says there&#39;s another unique quality from this &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;side-lighting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; effect from Earth: It will also change how we perceive the shape of the moon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Normally when you look at the full moon ... it doesn&#39;t look like a sphere, it just looks like a disc,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Chapman told CBC News from Dartmouth, N.S. But the eclipse lighting turns it from a flat, bright, silvery disc into more of &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;a sphere hanging in the sky.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;...Worm?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing of this eclipse also aligns with how different cultures around the world refer to the moon during this particular month.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts attribute the &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;worm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; moniker to Indigenous tribes in the southern U.S. who would see more insects and earthworms emerge during this time of year, and it stuck through its usage in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.almanac.com/content/full-moon-march#:~:text=by%20the%20name-,Worm%20Moon,-.%20For%20many%20years&quot; href=&quot;https://www.almanac.com/content/full-moon-march#:~:text=by%20the%20name-,Worm%20Moon,-.%20For%20many%20years&quot;&gt;Old Farmer&#39;s Almanac&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as March&#39;s full moon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But other cultures didn&#39;t see those worms, instead calling it by different names. For example, &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;more northern tribes of the northeastern United States knew this as the crow moon, with the cawing of crows signalling the end of winter,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/the-next-full-moon-is-the-worm-moon/&quot; href=&quot;https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/the-next-full-moon-is-the-worm-moon/&quot;&gt;writes NASA&#39;s Gordon Johnston&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Mi&#39;kmaq, whose traditional territories include Eastern and Atlantic Canada,&amp;nbsp;the moon around March is known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Si&#39;ko&#39;ku&#39;s&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(pronounced&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xroBpjT0gFY&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xroBpjT0gFY&quot;&gt;see-uke-ay-we-goos&lt;/a&gt;), or the maple or maple sugar moon, owing to this time of year when sap starts running&amp;nbsp;down trees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;A lot of the time, the moons are reflective of the season and the time of year,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; says Hilding Neilson, an astronomer and professor at Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador. He says this contextual naming of lunar cycles is common.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;For many cultures around the world, the moon is something you watch and you see things change [around you]. And so you get various names reflecting community, telling stories and how you operate,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Neilson told CBC News from St. John&#39;s.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s why a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;blood worm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;to some could be&amp;nbsp;a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;scarlet crow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;or even a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;red maple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;moon to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So when can I see it?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing it in Canada will mean staying up late or waking up very early. The good news is that you won&#39;t need any special equipment to view it and light pollution won&#39;t affect visibility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eclipse&#39;s totality will last for just over an hour, with its strongest phase in the middle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Newfoundland time: Starting at 3:56 a.m. to 5:01 a.m. on Friday, March 14.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Atlantic time: Starting at 3:26 a.m. to 4:31 a.m. on Friday March 14.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eastern time: Starting at 2:26 a.m. to 3:31 a.m. on Friday, March 14.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Central time: Starting at 1:26 a.m. to 2:31 a.m. on Friday, March 14.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mountain time: Starting at 12:26 a.m. to 1:31 a.m. on Friday, March 14.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pacific time: Starting at 11:26 p.m. on Thursday, March 13, to 12:31 a.m. on Friday, March 14.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world&#39;s biggest trading bloc was expecting the U.S. tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense transatlantic relations. Only last month, Washington warned Europe that it would have to take care of its own security in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU measures will cover goods from the United States worth some 26 billion euros ($40 billion Cdn)&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;and not just steel and aluminum products. Textiles, home appliances, agricultural goods will be hit with tariffs, as will motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans, the latter of which were also taxed&amp;nbsp;during U.S. President Donald Trump&#39;s first term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU duties aim for pressure points in the U.S. while minimizing additional damage to Europe. The tariffs — taxes on imports — primarily target Republican-held states, hitting soybeans in House Speaker Mike Johnson&#39;s Louisiana, and also beef and poultry in Kansas and Nebraska. Produce in Alabama, Georgia and Virginia is also on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission, which manages trade and commercial conflicts on behalf of the 27 EU member countries, said leather goods and agricultural products beyond beef and poultry would be hit, including&amp;nbsp;some seafood, nuts, eggs, sugar and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tariffs &#39;not in our common interest&#39;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement that the bloc &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;will always remain open to negotiation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;As the U.S. are applying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH |&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trudeau seeks closer ties, trade with European allies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trudeau seeks closer ties, trade with European allies also targeted by Trump&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with the head of NATO and EU officials in Brussels, hoping to boost trade and political ties as Canada stares down a possible trade war with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump said his taxes would help create U.S. factory jobs, but von der Leyen said: &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Jobs are at stake. Prices will go up. In Europe and in the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We deeply regret this measure. Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business&amp;nbsp;and even worse for consumers. These tariffs are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Chamber of Commerce to the EU said the U.S. tariffs and EU countermeasures &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;will only harm jobs, prosperity and security on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The two sides must de-escalate and find a negotiated outcome urgently,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; the chamber said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A repeat of Trump&#39;s 1st term&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump slapped&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/eu-tariffs-united-states-1.4693686&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/eu-tariffs-united-states-1.4693686&quot;&gt;similar tariffs on EU&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;steel and aluminum during his first term in office, which enraged European and other allies. The EU also imposed countermeasures in retaliation at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, the EU action will involve two steps. First, on April 1, the commission will reintroduce what it calls &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;rebalancing measures,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; which the EU had from 2018 and 2020 but were then suspended under the Biden administration. Then on April 13 come the additional duties targeting 18 billion euros ($19.6 billion) in U.S. exports to the bloc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does Trump really want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 hours agoDuration9:57Lots of apparent flip-flopping on the part of U.S. President Donald Trump has given Canada&#39;s public and politicians alike a case of whiplash as they try to navigate the ongoing trade war. Political commentator, author and speechwriter for former president George W. Bush, David Frum, stops by Power &amp;amp; Politics to reflect on the potential lasting damage to the Canada-U.S. relationship and weighs in on what he thinks could be going on in Trump&#39;s head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU Trade Commissioner&amp;nbsp;Maros Sefcovic&amp;nbsp;travelled to Washington last month in an effort to head off the tariffs, meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other top trade officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said on Wednesday that it became clear during the trip &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;that the EU is not the problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I argued to avoid the unnecessary burden of measures and countermeasures, but you need a partner for that. You need both hands to clap,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Sefcovic&amp;nbsp;told reporters at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;European steel companies brace for losses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU could lose up to 3.7 million tons of steel exports, according to the European steel association Eurofer. The U.S. is the second-biggest export market for EU steel producers, representing 16 per cent&amp;nbsp;of the total EU steel exports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU estimates that annual trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion US, representing some 30 per cent&amp;nbsp;of global trade. While the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, it says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain, which isn&#39;t part of the EU, meanwhile said it won&#39;t impose retaliatory measures of its own on the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

With Canada, it’s being done in public</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Former senior Canadian intelligence officials say&amp;nbsp;Canada&amp;nbsp;needs to be on the lookout for campaigns aimed at destabilizing the country amid U.S. President Donald Trump&#39;s escalating 51st state threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they told CBC News that the most potent weapon wielded by the Trump administration to advance the cause of annexation&amp;nbsp;would likely not be the intelligence agencies directed by Director of National Intelligence&amp;nbsp;Tulsi Gabbard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I would regard Mr. Musk as a problem,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;said Ward Elcock, who headed CSIS&amp;nbsp;for a decade including during the 9/11 attacks and also served as national security adviser. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I think that&#39;s on a number of fronts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has worked to destabilize many governments and nations in the past, using methods as mundane as corruption and as drastic as assassination, but the former spy chiefs say a campaign aimed at Canada would likely rely less on cloak-and-dagger&amp;nbsp;tactics and more on social media — such as the Elon Musk-owned X platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Is [Trump] trying to change political views in this country? If so, that&#39;s foreign interference,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said&amp;nbsp;Dick Fadden, who also headed CSIS and served as national security adviser to former prime minister Stephen Harper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It&#39;s no more acceptable from the United States than it is from China or Russia or anybody else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Economic distress: Canada&#39;s weak spot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neil Bisson is a former CSIS intelligence officer who is now director of the Global Intelligence Knowledge Network&amp;nbsp;and teaches at the University of Ottawa&#39;s Professional Development Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says that in spite of visible signs of Canadian unity in the face of annexation threats, there are those who are vulnerable to the siren call, particularly among the young who feel economically disadvantaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;That would be one of the linchpins, one of the cracks in the armour that another country would be looking at trying to exploit,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he told CBC News.&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;If you have individuals who are concerned about where their next meal is coming from or if they&#39;re going to get a roof over their head, that supersedes sovereignty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tariff war: Does Trump actually know what he&#39;s doing? | About That&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Donald Trump is pausing tariffs — again — on some goods from Canada and Mexico. Andrew Chang breaks down two schools of thought: whether Trump&#39;s chaotic approach stems from lack of planning, or a much more intentional strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said those Canadians could be targeted by propaganda campaigns that sell American citizenship as the answer to their economic woes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;And there will be individuals within Canada who could potentially be co-opted to push that narrative forward,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Bisson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump administration officials have given numerous rationales for the tariffs against Canada, but Trump himself has said that he wants to use&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://ici.radio-canada.ca/rci/en/news/2131198/trump-says-he-would-use-economic-force-to-join-canada-with-u-s&quot; href=&quot;https://ici.radio-canada.ca/rci/en/news/2131198/trump-says-he-would-use-economic-force-to-join-canada-with-u-s&quot;&gt;economic force&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to join Canada to the U.S. On Tuesday morning, he again said Canada could&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-canada-steel-alumimum-tariffs-1.7480309&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-canada-steel-alumimum-tariffs-1.7480309&quot;&gt;only avoid economic ruin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;through annexation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;He intends clearly to try and destabilize our economy,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Elcock. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The reality is that if Canada is really impoverished, people may start to think about it. That&#39;s always the possibility —&amp;nbsp;that not all Canadians are are going to be willing to endure economic deprivation. And so some may start to think about it as time goes along.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#39;People start believing it&#39;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fadden says governments and intelligence agencies have learned the hard way of the power of&amp;nbsp;disinformation and propaganda channelled through social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;You keep repeating things often enough, people start believing it,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;If it continues down this path for years, virtually anybody can be worn down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to sending politicians to negotiate with counterparts in Washington, says Fadden, &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;we need to find a way to play back on the information front.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Canadians and Americans will suffer the consequences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says that means finding ways &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;to use social media more effectively than I believe we have been doing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bisson says government&amp;nbsp;assistance for those affected by tariffs could blunt the impact of such propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;This is the Canadian government trying to shore up that political opinion within their own citizenship to say, &#39;OK we&#39;ve got this covered, we&#39;re going to take care of you no matter what,&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Because if that wasn&#39;t done and things were starting to destabilize economically, that would give people even more reason to fall back on thinking, well, maybe it&#39;s a better idea if we&#39;ve just succumbed to this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#39;Tripwires&#39; for spies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intelligence professionals say it&#39;s possible that the U.S. government would use more intrusive tactics, such as fomenting or financing pro-annexationist groups within Canada to create the impression of a groundswell of support for the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;They have an extraordinary capacity to do this,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Fadden. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The real issue to me is whether in respect of Canada, they will actually make use of those capabilities and resources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says Canada should be on the lookout. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We need to start at the basics. We need to start monitoring money flows. We need to start talking about whether they&#39;re trying to interfere with our elections at all levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he says covert operations on Canadian soil would likely offer the U.S. little return in exchange for a great deal of risk. And Trump is typically his own messenger, preferring the megaphone to the coded message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I would argue that the current president&#39;s approach is likely to be as effective as using the relatively&amp;nbsp;secret resources of the CIA or the U.S. intelligence community,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;Fadden said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former spy chiefs say U.S. intelligence agencies have rarely operated in Canada in the past, and would need&amp;nbsp;time to develop networks. It would be difficult for them to get very far without alerting the Canadians to their presence, said Elcock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Intelligence organizations are out looking for possible threats all the time,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said, and have&amp;nbsp;intelligence &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;tripwires&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; set up to help monitor the threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The likelihood that the Americans would run afoul of something, like of a tripwire at some point or talk to somebody who then would report it — those things are highly probable,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Purges at agencies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intelligence professionals who spoke to CBC News all said that they put some faith in the professionalism of their U.S. counterparts, and their historic attachments to alliances such as Five Eyes and NATO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elcock&amp;nbsp;said U.S. agencies would have to worry about their own people talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;There is a long relationship between Canada and the United States and there will still be people around who would not necessarily approve. So I don&#39;t think they could with any certainty carry out something like that — that wasn&#39;t a very, very closely held operation,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those calculations could change&amp;nbsp;if the Trump administration continues to remove and replace personnel in the agencies down to the managerial and operational level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;The more you get people who buy into the current U.S. president&#39;s philosophy of life,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Fadden, &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;the more he shifts professionals out of the intelligence community and puts his own people in, the more worrisome it becomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for those Canadians who want to see their country annexed, and have loudly made that case,&amp;nbsp;Elcock says not all should necessarily be seen&amp;nbsp;as a security threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It would depend on what their activities were. There are lots of people who have weird ideas in Canada who don&#39;t qualify as a threat to the security of Canada,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; he said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Many of those organizations would already be on the radar.&amp;nbsp;So the reality is, if they start to become active, it&#39;s not going to be something nobody&#39;s aware of.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experts all said that Canada is a much more resilient target than other countries where the U.S.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/radio/sunday/american-hypocrisy-on-russian-hacking-why-young-men-an-over-the-phone-book-club-bach-and-anti-semitism-1.3919404/america-s-hypocritical-outrage-over-russia-s-cyber-interference-in-its-presidential-election-michael-s-essay-1.3919412&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/radio/sunday/american-hypocrisy-on-russian-hacking-why-young-men-an-over-the-phone-book-club-bach-and-anti-semitism-1.3919404/america-s-hypocritical-outrage-over-russia-s-cyber-interference-in-its-presidential-election-michael-s-essay-1.3919412&quot;&gt;is known to have conducted destabilization operations&lt;/a&gt;, but that doesn&#39;t mean it is immune to pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We need to worry more and talk more about the medium and long term, rather than just worrying about the critically important tariffs that are there now,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; said Fadden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He warned if Canada is subjected to a prolonged campaign of economic warfare,&amp;nbsp;then &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;at some point somebody&#39;s going to have to cry uncle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Fadden doesn&#39;t see a military invasion on the horizon, he said&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;economic and cultural control of the country can be just as effective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The federal government announced a plan on Wednesday to slap tariffs on $29.8 billion worth of American goods to hit back against U.S.&amp;nbsp;President Donald Trump after he imposed punishing tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum early this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc, the government&#39;s point person on Canada-U.S. relations,&amp;nbsp;said Trump&#39;s attack on Canadian industry is &quot;unjustified and unjustifiable&quot; and the government must hit back as the U.S. inserts &quot;disruption and disorder&quot; into what was once one of the most successful trading relationships in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada retaliating as U.S. tariffs on aluminum and steel hit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started 5 hours agoLiveFinance Minister Dominic LeBlanc, Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly and Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne outlined Canada&#39;s plan to respond to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum, with almost $30 billion in tariffs on American goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We will not stand idly by while our iconic steel and aluminum industries are being unfairly targeted,&quot; he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeBlanc said the American products being hit with these tariffs include U.S.-made steel and aluminum, computers, sports equipment and certain cast iron products, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-canada-steel-alumimum-tariffs-1.7480309&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-canada-steel-alumimum-tariffs-1.7480309&quot;&gt;Trump placing 25% tariff on steel, aluminum after backing off 50% threat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump&#39;s metals&amp;nbsp;tariffs, which took effect just after midnight,&amp;nbsp;are separate from the other tariffs Trump levied on Canada last week — and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-trump-trade-war-deal-1.7476311&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-trump-trade-war-deal-1.7476311&quot;&gt;later partially dialled back&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;— to supposedly pressure the country to do more at the border on drugs and migrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada immediately levied tariffs on $30 billion worth of American goods in response to those initial&amp;nbsp;tariffs — and didn&#39;t take them off even after Trump rejigged his tariff regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie&amp;nbsp;Joly&amp;nbsp;said Trump has claimed he needs to impose tariffs now because Canadian steel and aluminum imports pose a &quot;national security threat&quot; — something she called a bogus and insulting justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The excuse for these tariffs shift every day.&amp;nbsp;The only constant seems to be President Trump&#39;s talks of annexing our country through economic coercion.&amp;nbsp;We will not back down and we will not give in to this coercion,&quot; she said. &quot;We need to fight back against this nonsense.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--body:attachment:1--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump deployed harsh rhetoric against Canada on Tuesday, threatening to ruin the country&amp;nbsp;economically and reiterating his desire to see the country become the 51st state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. president upped the ante on his annexation taunts, saying the only way for Canada to avoid his attempts to torpedo the economy is for the country to &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;become our cherished Fifty-First State.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump said the border between Canada and the U.S., which was first set centuries ago after the American Revolutionary War and reaffirmed by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/jays-treaty&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/jays-treaty&quot;&gt;a series of treaties&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/oregon-treaty#:~:text=The%20Oregon%20Treaty%20was%20an,west%20of%20the%20Rocky%20Mountains.&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/oregon-treaty#:~:text=The%20Oregon%20Treaty%20was%20an,west%20of%20the%20Rocky%20Mountains.&quot;&gt;the years to follow&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;an artificial&amp;nbsp;line of separation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; that he wants to see disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joly said Canada is not just in a fight to get Trump to back off tariffs but also to save the country from a possible takeover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;It&#39;s not just a threat to Canadian jobs, Canadian families. It is an existential threat to our country,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she said. &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;This is not only a fight about the economy, it is about the future of our country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry Minister&amp;nbsp;François-Philippe Champagne said Trump&#39;s tariffs will push up the price of virtually everything U.S. factories produce, given just how dependent they are on Canadian metals. The U.S., for example, produces only 16 per cent of the aluminum it needs, while 60 per cent of its supply comes from Quebec alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Champagne said Trump&#39;s relentless trade attacks likely aren&#39;t going away anytime soon and Canada needs an attitude shift to become more independent and resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH |&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Champagne says Trump&#39;s tariffs are weakening North America:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:2--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Champagne says Trump&#39;s tariffs weakening North American economy, national security&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne says &#39;we cannot let uncertainty become the new certainty,&#39; adding U.S President Donald Trump&#39;s trade war is going to weaken North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian officials, including LeBlanc and Ontario Premier Doug Ford, will meet with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Trump&#39;s tariff&amp;nbsp;czar,&amp;nbsp;and U.S. Trade Representative&amp;nbsp;Jamieson Greer&amp;nbsp;in Washington on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeBlanc said those talks will be about trying to get the Americans to drop all their existing tariffs and convince the administration to spare Canada when it pushes ahead with more tariffs on April 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We will continue to maintain our countermeasures and increase them on April 2 if we can&#39;t get to a position where their&amp;nbsp;initial measures are all lifted from Canadian businesses,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; LeBlanc said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday&#39;s meeting is also a&amp;nbsp;chance to&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;lower the temperature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; given the heated rhetoric coming from Trump in recent days, LeBlanc said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeBlanc said Trump has made some &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;outrageous comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; about Canadian sovereignty&amp;nbsp;and they need to be addressed&amp;nbsp;with his officials face-to-face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joly&amp;nbsp;added Canada will continue to exert &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;maximum pressure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; on the Americans through countermeasures while also being open to offering &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;off-ramps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; to Trump to bring this trade war to a satisfying close for both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for what Canadian officials will say if the 51st state taunts are raised, Joly said that talk is offensive and will be dismissed outright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;When it comes to Canadian sovereignty,&amp;nbsp;it&#39;s&amp;nbsp;very simple: it&#39;s not even on the table,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime minister-designate Mark Carney, who is expected to take the reins of power after being sworn in sometime later this week, said he&#39;s ready to sit down with Trump soon to discuss a resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he said those talks can only happen &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;under a position where there&#39;s respect&amp;nbsp;for Canadian sovereignty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;We&#39;re all going to be better off when the greatest economic and security partnership in the world is renewed and is relaunched,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Carney&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move comes after&amp;nbsp;Ford and&amp;nbsp;U.S.&amp;nbsp;Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick&amp;nbsp;had a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;productive conversation about the economic relationship between the United States and Canada,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ford said in a joint statement posted on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Secretary Lutnick agreed to officially meet with Premier Ford in Washington on Thursday, March 13 alongside the United States Trade Representative to discuss a renewed USMCA&amp;nbsp;ahead of the April 2 reciprocal tariff deadline,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; the statement reads.&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;In response, Ontario agreed to suspend its 25 per cent surcharge on exports of electricity to Michigan, New York and Minnesota.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:0--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford previously announced on Monday plans to have the province impose a 25 per cent surcharge on Ontario-generated electricity purchased by American states in response to a series of tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. Ontario provides power to roughly 1.5 million U.S.-based customers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump, meanwhile, issued numerous threats aimed at Ontario and Canada on Tuesday after the province initially imposed the&amp;nbsp;surcharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH | White House press secretary asked about Canada:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:1--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump hasn&#39;t yet spoken to Carney, but his phone is &#39;always open,&#39; White House rep says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a White House briefing, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said U.S. President Donald Trump has not yet spoken to prime minister-designate Mark Carney, before she went on to criticize Ontario&#39;s electricity export surcharge — imposed by Premier Doug Ford in the face of U.S. tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of meandering posts to his Truth Social platform, Trump said Ontario &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;will pay a financial price for this so big that it will be read about in History Books for many years to come!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went on to accuse Canada of &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;stooping so low as to use ELECTRICITY, that so affects the life of innocent people, as a bargaining chip and threat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; in the trade war his administration started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those comments came shortly after an earlier post in which Trump said&amp;nbsp;he&#39;ll double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum starting Wednesday in response to Ontario&#39;s electricity levy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also said he would declare a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;National Emergency on Electricity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; within the American regions impacted by Ontario&#39;s electricity levity, presumably referring to New York, Michigan and Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump then launched into a lengthy rant about the U.S. annexing Canada to make it &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;our cherished Fifty First State.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also threatened to &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;substantially increase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; tariffs on auto imports on April 2, which Trump predicted would &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Heavily armed troops in pickup trucks descended on a shopping mall restaurant in the Guadalajara area for Clark&#39;s arrest in October, according to social media video verified by CBC&amp;nbsp;News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clark, who previously lived in the Toronto area, made his first appearance in U.S. federal court in Phoenix last week. He is scheduled to be transported to Los Angeles to stand trial on eight felony charges related to an alleged&amp;nbsp;cocaine-trafficking conspiracy and four killings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four killings, including those of the couple in Caledon,&amp;nbsp;occurred in Ontario but are being prosecuted in the United States since they were carried out in support of a criminal scheme with roots in California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Property records and online posts suggest Clark sold his house in Burlington, Ont., and relocated to Mexico in 2022.

&lt;p&gt;Authorities have said Wedding and Clark&#39;s alleged $1-billion US network — linked to Mexico&#39;s notorious Sinaloa cartel — used stash houses in California to help move tons of cocaine and fentanyl throughout North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the sprawling FBI investigation, outlined in court records, read like a Hollywood script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. federal agents accompanied a former drug trafficker to Toronto, where he wore a recording device to meet with suspected co-conspirators at an auto body shop. In California, investigators enlisted the National Guard to surveil a cocaine deal from an airship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RCMP said Wedding, 43, &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;continues to pose one of the largest organized crime threats to Canada, even as a fugitive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--body:attachment:1--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators said Wedding and Clark orchestrated the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/caledon-sidhu-murders-shooter-unidentified-1.7356505&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/caledon-sidhu-murders-shooter-unidentified-1.7356505&quot;&gt;November&amp;nbsp;2023 killings&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of Jagtar and Harbhajan Sidhu, an Indian couple visiting their children in Caledon, northwest of Toronto. Their 28-year-old daughter, Jaspreet Kaur Sidhu, witnessed the rampage and was shot 13 times. She survived&amp;nbsp;but suffered &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;life-altering injuries,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; police said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities said the innocent family was mistakenly targeted over a stolen drug shipment. The gunman has not been identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court documents, U.S. prosecutors allege Clark later sent a Toronto-based hitman known as &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Mr. Perfect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; a list of targets and arranged for him to attend &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;military training&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; in Mexico last year. Afterward, the alleged gunman, Malik&amp;nbsp;Damion Cunningham, purportedly wrote to Clark: &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;I am what you call now ELITE thanks to you brother.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Days later in a Niagara Falls, Ont., driveway, Cunningham allegedly fired a single shot to the head of a reputed cross-border drug trafficker&amp;nbsp;for $100,000, &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;plus expenses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; Encrypted communications suggest Clark supplied the shooter with two Glock handguns and a 2023 Ford Explorer as a getaway vehicle, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key FBI informant met with Wedding and Clark in a Mexico City Starbucks in January 2024, as part of the investigation. According to court documents, the man wore a wire and recorded Clark explaining he sends two to three tonnes of cocaine to Canada per month, including 600 kilograms to Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wedding, Clark and 14 other alleged accomplices were indicted by a federal grand jury in California last year. Four co-defendants, including Cunningham, remain in custody in Ontario and face extradition to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another alleged accomplice, Gurpreet Singh, is scheduled to appear in a downtown Toronto court on Thursday as he asks to be released on bail, pending extradition. U.S. prosecutors have urged against Singh&#39;s release, saying he poses a &lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;substantial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; flight risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Investigators are aware that Wedding continues to traffic drugs while in hiding,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt; assistant U.S. attorneys Maria Jhai and Lyndsi Allsop wrote&amp;nbsp;in a letter dated Feb. 21 and filed as an exhibit in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;q&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot; title=&quot;Français&quot;&gt;Wedding should not be granted access to an additional loyalist through the release of Singh on bail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prosecutors allege Wedding had to intervene to secure Singh&#39;s release last summer, after he was kidnapped by cartel members in Mexico&amp;nbsp;over a $600,000 drug debt.&lt;/p&gt;
