the definition, it will sound familiar. Google&#39;s isn&#39;t bad:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  A self-righteously moralistic person who behaves as if
  superior to others.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This sense of the word originated in the 18th century, and
its age is an important clue: it shows that although
wokeness is a comparatively recent phenomenon, it&#39;s an
instance of a much older one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s a certain kind of person who&#39;s attracted to a
shallow, exacting kind of moral purity, and who demonstrates
his purity by attacking anyone who breaks the rules. Every
society has these people. All that changes is the rules they
enforce. In Victorian England it was Christian virtue. In
Stalin&#39;s Russia it was orthodox Marxism-Leninism. For the
woke, it&#39;s social justice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So if you want to understand wokeness, the question to ask
is not why people behave this way. Every society has prigs.
The question to ask is why our prigs are priggish about
these ideas, at this moment. And to answer that we have to
ask when and where wokeness began.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The answer to the first question is the 1980s. Wokeness is a
second, more aggressive wave of political correctness, which
started in the late 1980s, died down in the late 1990s, and
then returned with a vengeance in the early 2010s, finally
peaking after the riots of 2020.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was not the original meaning of woke, but it&#39;s rarely
used in the original sense now. Now the pejorative sense is
the dominant one. What &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; it mean now? I&#39;ve often been
asked to define both wokeness and political correctness by
people who think they&#39;re meaningless labels, so I will. They
both have the same definition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  An aggressively performative focus on social justice.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In other words, it&#39;s people being prigs about social
justice. And that&#39;s the real problem — the
performativeness, not the social justice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Racism, for example, is a genuine problem. Not a problem on
the scale that the woke believe it to be, but a genuine one.
I don&#39;t think any reasonable person would deny that. The
problem with political correctness was not that it focused
on marginalized groups, but the shallow, aggressive way in
which it did so. Instead of going out into the world and
quietly helping members of marginalized groups, the
politically correct focused on getting people in trouble for
using the wrong words to talk about them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for where political correctness began, if you think about
it, you probably already know the answer. Did it begin
outside universities and spread to them from this external
source? Obviously not; it has always been most extreme in
universities. So where in universities did it begin? Did it
begin in math, or the hard sciences, or engineering, and
spread from there to the humanities and social sciences?
Those are amusing images, but no, obviously it began in the
humanities and social sciences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why there? And why then? What happened in the humanities and
social sciences in the 1980s?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A successful theory of the origin of political correctness
has to be able to explain why it didn&#39;t happen earlier. Why
didn&#39;t it happen during the protest movements of the 1960s,
for example? They were concerned with much the same issues.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason the student protests of the 1960s didn&#39;t lead to
political correctness was precisely that — they were
student movements. They didn&#39;t have any real power. The
students may have been talking a lot about women&#39;s
liberation and black power, but it was not what they were
being taught in their classes. Not yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in the early 1970s the student protestors of the 1960s
began to finish their dissertations and get hired as
professors. At first they were neither powerful nor
numerous. But as more of their peers joined them and the
previous generation of professors started to retire, they
gradually became both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason political correctness began in the humanities and
social sciences was that these fields offered more scope for
the injection of politics. A 1960s radical who got a job as
a physics professor could still attend protests, but his
political beliefs wouldn&#39;t affect his work. Whereas research
in sociology and modern literature can be made as political
as you like.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I saw political correctness arise. When I started college in
1982 it was not yet a thing. Female students might object if
someone said something they considered sexist, but no one
was getting &lt;i&gt;reported&lt;/i&gt; for it. It was still not a thing when
I started grad school in 1986. It was definitely a thing in
1988 though, and by the early 1990s it seemed to pervade
campus life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What happened? How did protest become punishment? Why were
the late 1980s the point at which protests against male
chauvinism (as it used to be called) morphed into formal
complaints to university authorities about sexism?
Basically, the 1960s radicals got tenure. They became the
Establishment they&#39;d protested against two decades before.
Now they were in a position not just to speak out about
their ideas, but to enforce them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new set of moral rules to enforce was exciting news to a
certain kind of student. What made it particularly exciting
was that they were allowed to attack professors. I remember
noticing that aspect of political correctness at the time.
It wasn&#39;t simply a grass-roots student movement. It was
faculty members encouraging students to attack other faculty
members. In that respect it was like the Cultural
Revolution. That wasn&#39;t a grass-roots movement either; that
was Mao unleashing the younger generation on his political
opponents. And in fact when Roderick MacFarquhar started
teaching a class on the Cultural Revolution at Harvard in
the late 1980s, many saw it as a comment on current events.
I don&#39;t know if it actually was, but people thought it was,
and that means the similarities were obvious.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;College students larp. It&#39;s their nature. It&#39;s usually
harmless. But larping morality turned out to be a poisonous
combination. The result was a kind of moral etiquette,
superficial but very complicated. Imagine having to explain
to a well-meaning visitor from another planet why using the
phrase &quot;people of color&quot; is considered particularly
enlightened, but saying &quot;colored people&quot; gets you fired. And
why exactly one isn&#39;t supposed to use the word &quot;negro&quot; now,
even though Martin Luther King used it constantly in his
speeches. There are no underlying principles. You&#39;d just
have to give him a long list of rules to memorize.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The danger of these rules was not just that they created
land mines for the unwary, but that their elaborateness made
them an effective substitute for virtue. Whenever a society
has a concept of heresy and orthodoxy, orthodoxy becomes a
substitute for virtue. You can be the worst person in the
world, but as long as you&#39;re orthodox you&#39;re better than
everyone who isn&#39;t. This makes orthodoxy very attractive to
bad people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But for it to work as a substitute for virtue, orthodoxy
must be difficult. If all you have to do to be orthodox is
wear some garment or avoid saying some word, everyone knows
to do it, and the only way to seem more virtuous than other
people is to actually be virtuous. The shallow, complicated,
and frequently changing rules of political correctness made
it the perfect substitute for actual virtue. And the result
was a world in which good people who weren&#39;t up to date on
current moral fashions were brought down by people whose
characters would make you recoil in horror if you could see
them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One big contributing factor in the rise of political
correctness was the lack of other things to be morally pure
about. Previous generations of prigs had been prigs mostly
about religion and sex. But among the cultural elite these
were the deadest of dead letters by the 1980s; if you were
religious, or a virgin, this was something you tended to
conceal rather than advertise. So the sort of people who
enjoy being moral enforcers had become starved of things to
enforce. A new set of rules was just what they&#39;d been
waiting for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Curiously enough, the tolerant side of the 1960s left helped
create the conditions in which the intolerant side
prevailed. The relaxed social rules advocated by the old,
easy-going hippy left became the dominant ones, at least
among the elite, and this left nothing for the naturally
intolerant to be intolerant about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another possibly contributing factor was the fall of the
Soviet empire. Marxism had been a popular focus of moral
purity on the left before political correctness emerged as a
competitor, but the pro-democracy movements in Eastern Bloc
countries took most of the shine off it. Especially the fall
of the Berlin Wall in 1989. You couldn&#39;t be on the side of
the Stasi. I remember looking at the moribund Soviet Studies
section of a used bookshop in Cambridge in the late 1980s
and thinking &quot;what will those people go on about now?&quot; As it
turned out the answer was right under my nose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing I noticed at the time about the first phase of
political correctness was that it was more popular with
women than men. As many writers (perhaps most eloquently
George Orwell) have observed, women seem more attracted than
men to the idea of being moral enforcers. But there was
another more specific reason women tended to be the
enforcers of political correctness. There was at this time a
great backlash against sexual harassment; the mid 1980s were
the point when the definition of sexual harassment was
expanded from explicit sexual advances to creating a
&quot;hostile environment.&quot; Within universities the classic form
of accusation was for a (female) student to say that a
professor made her &quot;feel uncomfortable.&quot; But the vagueness
of this accusation allowed the radius of forbidden behavior
to expand to include talking about heterodox ideas. Those
make people uncomfortable too.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Was it sexist to propose that Darwin&#39;s greater male
variability hypothesis might explain some variation in human
performance? Sexist enough to get Larry Summers pushed out
as president of Harvard, apparently. One woman who heard the
talk in which he mentioned this idea said it made her feel
&quot;physically ill&quot; and that she had to leave halfway through.
If the test of a hostile environment is how it makes people
feel, this certainly sounds like one. And yet it does seem
plausible that greater male variability explains some of the
variation in human performance. So which should prevail,
comfort or truth? Surely if truth should prevail anywhere,
it should be in universities; that&#39;s supposed to be their
specialty; but for decades starting in the late 1980s the
politically correct tried to pretend this conflict didn&#39;t
exist.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f6n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Political correctness seemed to burn out in the second half
of the 1990s. One reason, perhaps the main reason, was that
it literally became a joke. It offered rich material for
comedians, who performed their usual disinfectant action
upon it. Humor is one of the most powerful weapons against
priggishness of any sort, because prigs, being humorless,
can&#39;t respond in kind. Humor was what defeated Victorian
prudishness, and by 2000 it seemed to have done the same
thing to political correctness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately this was an illusion. Within universities the
embers of political correctness were still glowing brightly.
After all, the forces that created it were still there. The
professors who started it were now becoming deans and
department heads. And in addition to their departments there
were now a bunch of new ones explicitly focused on social
justice. Students were still hungry for things to be morally
pure about. And there had been an explosion in the number of
university administrators, many of whose jobs involved
enforcing various forms of political correctness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the early 2010s the embers of political correctness burst
into flame anew. There were several differences between this
new phase and the original one. It was more virulent. It
spread further into the real world, although it still burned
hottest within universities. And it was concerned with a
wider variety of sins. In the first phase of political
correctness there were really only three things people got
accused of: sexism, racism, and homophobia (which at the
time was a neologism invented for the purpose). But between
then and 2010 a lot of people had spent a lot of time trying
to invent new kinds of -isms and -phobias and seeing which
could be made to stick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second phase was, in multiple senses, political
correctness metastasized. Why did it happen when it did? My
guess is that it was due to the rise of social media,
particularly Tumblr and Twitter, because one of the most
distinctive features of the second wave of political
correctness was the &lt;i&gt;cancel mob&lt;/i&gt;: a mob of angry people
uniting on social media to get someone ostracized or fired.
Indeed this second wave of political correctness was
originally called &quot;cancel culture&quot;; it didn&#39;t start to be
called &quot;wokeness&quot; till the 2020s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One aspect of social media that surprised almost everyone at
first was the popularity of outrage. Users seemed to &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt;
being outraged. We&#39;re so used to this idea now that we take
it for granted, but really it&#39;s pretty strange. Being
outraged is not a pleasant feeling. You wouldn&#39;t expect
people to seek it out. But they do. And above all, they want
to share it. I happened to be running a forum from 2007 to
2014, so I can actually quantify how much they want to share
it: our users were about three times more likely to upvote
something if it outraged them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This tilt toward outrage wasn&#39;t due to wokeness. It&#39;s an
inherent feature of social media, or at least this
generation of it. But it did make social media the perfect
mechanism for fanning the flames of wokeness.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f7n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It wasn&#39;t just public social networks that drove the rise of
wokeness though. Group chat apps were also critical,
especially in the final step, cancellation. Imagine if a
group of employees trying to get someone fired had to do it
using only email. It would be hard to organize a mob. But
once you have group chat, mobs form naturally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another contributing factor in this second wave of political
correctness was the dramatic increase in the polarization of
the press. In the print era, newspapers were constrained to
be, or at least seem, politically neutral. The department
stores that ran ads in the New York Times wanted to reach
everyone in the region, both liberal and conservative, so
the Times had to serve both. But the Times didn&#39;t regard
this neutrality as something forced upon them. They embraced
it as their duty as a &lt;i&gt;paper of record&lt;/i&gt; — as one of the big
newspapers that aimed to be chronicles of their times,
reporting every sufficiently important story from a neutral
point of view.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I grew up the papers of record seemed timeless, almost
sacred institutions. Papers like the New York Times and
Washington Post had immense prestige, partly because other
sources of news were limited, but also because they did make
some effort to be neutral.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately it turned out that the paper of record was
mostly an artifact of the constraints imposed by print.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f8n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
When your market was determined by geography, you had
to be neutral. But publishing online enabled — in fact
probably forced — newspapers to switch to serving markets
defined by ideology instead of geography. Most that remained
in business fell in the direction they&#39;d already been
leaning: left. On October 11, 2020 the New York Times
announced that &quot;The paper is in the midst of an evolution
from the stodgy paper of record into a juicy collection of
great narratives.&quot;
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f9n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
Meanwhile journalists, of a sort,
had arisen to serve the right as well. And so journalism,
which in the previous era had been one of the great
centralizing forces, now became one of the great polarizing
ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rise of social media and the increasing polarization of
journalism reinforced one another. In fact there arose a new
variety of journalism involving a loop through social media.
Someone would say something controversial on social media.
Within hours it would become a news story. Outraged readers
would then post links to the story on social media, driving
further arguments online. It was the cheapest source of
clicks imaginable. You didn&#39;t have to maintain overseas news
bureaus or pay for month-long investigations. All you had to
do was watch Twitter for controversial remarks and repost
them on your site, with some additional comments to inflame
readers further.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the press there was money in wokeness. But they weren&#39;t
the only ones. That was one of the biggest differences
between the two waves of political correctness: the first
was driven almost entirely by amateurs, but the second was
often driven by professionals. For some it was their whole
job. By 2010 a new class of administrators had arisen whose
job was basically to enforce wokeness. They played a role
similar to that of the political commissars who got attached
to military and industrial organizations in the USSR: they
weren&#39;t directly in the flow of the organization&#39;s work, but
watched from the side to ensure that nothing improper
happened in the doing of it. These new administrators could
often be recognized by the word &quot;inclusion&quot; in their titles.
Within institutions this was the preferred euphemism for
wokeness; a new list of banned words, for example, would
usually be called an &quot;inclusive language guide.&quot;
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f10n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;10&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This new class of bureaucrats pursued a woke agenda as if
their jobs depended on it, because they did. If you hire
people to keep watch for a particular type of problem,
they&#39;re going to find it, because otherwise there&#39;s no
justification for their existence.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f11n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;11&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
But these
bureaucrats also represented a second and possibly even
greater danger. Many were involved in hiring, and when
possible they tried to ensure their employers hired only
people who shared their political beliefs. The most
egregious cases were the new &quot;DEI statements&quot; that some
universities started to require from faculty candidates,
proving their commitment to wokeness. Some universities used
these statements as the initial filter and only even
considered candidates who scored high enough on them. You&#39;re
not hiring Einstein that way; imagine what you get instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another factor in the rise of wokeness was the Black Lives
Matter movement, which started in 2013 when a white man was
acquitted after killing a black teenager in Florida. But
this didn&#39;t launch wokeness; it was well underway by 2013.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly for the Me Too Movement, which took off in 2017
after the first news stories about Harvey Weinstein&#39;s
history of raping women. It accelerated wokeness, but didn&#39;t
play the same role in launching it that the 80s version did
in launching political correctness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The election of Donald Trump in 2016 also accelerated
wokeness, particularly in the press, where outrage now meant
traffic. Trump made the New York Times a lot of money:
headlines during his first administration mentioned his name
at about four times the rate of previous presidents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2020 we saw the biggest accelerant of all, after a white
police officer asphyxiated a black suspect on video. At this
point the metaphorical fire became a literal one, as violent
protests broke out across America. But in retrospect this
turned out to be peak woke, or close to it. By every measure
I&#39;ve seen, wokeness peaked in 2020 or 2021.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wokeness is sometimes described as a mind-virus. What makes
it viral is that it defines new types of impropriety. Most
people are afraid of impropriety; they&#39;re never exactly sure
what the social rules are or which ones they might be
breaking. Especially if the rules change rapidly. And since
most people already worry that they might be breaking rules
they don&#39;t know about, if you tell them they&#39;re breaking a
rule, their default reaction is to believe you. Especially
if multiple people tell them. Which in turn is a recipe for
exponential growth. Zealots invent some new impropriety to
avoid. The first people to adopt it are fellow zealots,
eager for new ways to signal their virtue. If there are
enough of these, the initial group of zealots is followed by
a much larger group, motivated by fear. They&#39;re not trying
to signal virtue; they&#39;re just trying to avoid getting in
trouble. At this point the new impropriety is now firmly
established. Plus its success has increased the rate of
change in social rules, which, remember, is one of the
reasons people are nervous about which rules they might be
breaking. So the cycle accelerates.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f12n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;12&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What&#39;s true of individuals is even more true of
organizations. Especially organizations without a powerful
leader. Such organizations do everything based on &quot;best
practices.&quot; There&#39;s no higher authority; if some new &quot;best
practice&quot; achieves critical mass, they &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; adopt it. And
in this case the organization can&#39;t do what it usually does
when it&#39;s uncertain: delay. It might be committing
improprieties right now! So it&#39;s surprisingly easy for a
small group of zealots to capture this type of organization
by describing new improprieties it might be guilty of. 
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f13n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;13&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How does this kind of cycle ever end? Eventually it leads to
disaster, and people start to say enough is enough. The
excesses of 2020 made a lot of people say that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since then wokeness has been in gradual but continual
retreat. Corporate CEOs, starting with Brian Armstrong, have
openly rejected it. Universities, led by the University of
Chicago and MIT, have explicitly confirmed their commitment
to free speech. Twitter, which was arguably the hub of
wokeness, was bought by Elon Musk in order to neutralize it,
and he seems to have succeeded — and not, incidentally, by
censoring left-wing users the way Twitter used to censor
right-wing ones, but without censoring either.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f14n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;14&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
Consumers have emphatically rejected brands that ventured
too far into wokeness. The Bud Light brand may have been
permanently damaged by it. I&#39;m not going to claim Trump&#39;s
second victory in 2024 was a referendum on wokeness; I think
he won, as presidential candidates always do, because he was
more &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/charisma.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;charismatic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; but voters&#39; 
disgust with wokeness must have helped.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what do we do now? Wokeness is already in retreat.
Obviously we should help it along. What&#39;s the best way to do
that? And more importantly, how do we avoid a third
outbreak? After all, it seemed to be dead once, but came
back worse than ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact there&#39;s an even more ambitious goal: is there a way
to prevent any similar outbreak of aggressively performative
moralism in the future — not just a third outbreak of
political correctness, but the next thing like it? Because
there will be a next thing. Prigs are prigs by nature. They
need rules to obey and enforce, and now that Darwin has cut
off their traditional supply of rules, they&#39;re constantly
hungry for new ones. All they need is someone to meet them
halfway by defining a new way to be morally pure, and we&#39;ll
see the same phenomenon again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let&#39;s start with the easier problem. Is there a simple,
principled way to deal with wokeness? I think there is: to
use the customs we already have for dealing with religion.
Wokeness is effectively a religion, just with God replaced
by protected classes. It&#39;s not even the first religion of
this kind; Marxism had a similar form, with God replaced by
the masses.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f15n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;15&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
And we already have well-established
customs for dealing with religion within organizations. You
can express your own religious identity and explain your
beliefs, but you can&#39;t call your coworkers infidels if they
disagree, or try to ban them from saying things that
contradict its doctrines, or insist that the organization
adopt yours as its official religion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we&#39;re not sure what to do about any particular
manifestation of wokeness, imagine we were dealing with some
other religion, like Christianity. Should we have people
within organizations whose jobs are to enforce woke
orthodoxy? No, because we wouldn&#39;t have people whose jobs
were to enforce Christian orthodoxy. Should we censor
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/02/17/roald-dahl-books-rewritten-offensive-matilda-witches-twits/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;writers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/KoustaStavroula/status/1562034502897106946&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;scientists&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; whose work contradicts woke doctrines?
No, because we wouldn&#39;t do this to people whose work
contradicted Christian teachings. Should job candidates be
required to write DEI statements? Of course not; imagine an
employer requiring proof of one&#39;s religious beliefs. Should
students and employees have to participate in woke
indoctrination sessions in which they&#39;re required to answer
questions about their beliefs to ensure compliance? No,
because we wouldn&#39;t dream of catechizing people in this way
about their religion.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f16n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;16&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One shouldn&#39;t feel bad about not wanting to watch woke
movies any more than one would feel bad about not wanting to
listen to Christian rock. In my twenties I drove across
America several times, listening to local radio stations.
Occasionally I&#39;d turn the dial and hear some new song. But
the moment anyone mentioned Jesus I&#39;d turn the dial again.
Even the tiniest bit of being preached to was enough to make
me lose interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But by the same token we should not automatically reject
everything the woke believe. I&#39;m not a Christian, but I can
see that many Christian principles are good ones. It would
be a mistake to discard them all just because one didn&#39;t
share the religion that espoused them. It would be the sort
of thing a religious zealot would do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we have genuine pluralism, I think we&#39;ll be safe from
future outbreaks of woke intolerance. Wokeness itself won&#39;t
go away. There will for the foreseeable future continue to
be pockets of woke zealots inventing new moral fashions. The
key is not to let them treat their fashions as normative.
They can change what their coreligionists are allowed to say
every few months if they like, but they mustn&#39;t be allowed
to change what we&#39;re allowed to say.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f17n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;17&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The more general problem — how to prevent similar outbreaks
of aggressively performative moralism — is of course
harder. Here we&#39;re up against human nature. There will
always be prigs. And in particular there will always be the
enforcers among them, the 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/conformism.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;aggressively conventional-minded&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
These people are born that way. Every society has them. So
the best we can do is to keep them bottled up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The aggressively conventional-minded aren&#39;t always on the
rampage. Usually they just enforce whatever random rules are
nearest to hand. They only become dangerous when some new
ideology gets a lot of them pointed in the same direction at
once. That&#39;s what happened during the Cultural Revolution,
and to a lesser extent (thank God) in the two waves of
political correctness we&#39;ve experienced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We can&#39;t get rid of the aggressively conventional-minded.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/woke.html#f18n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;18&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
And we couldn&#39;t prevent people from creating new
ideologies that appealed to them even if we wanted to. So if
we want to keep them bottled up, we have to do it one step
downstream. Fortunately when the aggressively
conventional-minded go on the rampage they always do one
thing that gives them away: they define new &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/heresy.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;heresies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to
punish people for. So the best way to protect ourselves from
future outbreaks of things like wokeness is to have powerful
antibodies against the concept of heresy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We should have a conscious bias against defining new forms
of heresy. Whenever anyone tries to ban saying something
that we&#39;d previously been able to say, our initial
assumption should be that they&#39;re wrong. Only our initial
assumption of course. If they can prove we should stop
saying it, then we should. But the burden of proof is on
them. In liberal democracies, people trying to prevent
something from being said will usually claim they&#39;re not
merely engaging in censorship, but trying to prevent some
form of &quot;harm&quot;. And maybe they&#39;re right. But once again, the
burden of proof is on them. It&#39;s not enough to claim harm;
they have to prove it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As long as the aggressively conventional-minded continue to
give themselves away by banning heresies, we&#39;ll always be
able to notice when they become aligned behind some new
ideology. And if we always fight back at that point, with
any luck we can stop them in their tracks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The number of true things we &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/say.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;can&#39;t say&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
should not increase. If it does, something is wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Why did 1960s radicals focus on the causes they did?
One of the people who reviewed drafts of this essay
explained this so well that I asked if I could quote him:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  The middle-class student protestors of the New Left
  rejected the socialist/Marxist left as unhip. They were
  interested in sexier forms of oppression uncovered by
  cultural analysis (Marcuse) and abstruse &quot;Theory&quot;. Labor
  politics became stodgy and old-fashioned. This took a
  couple generations to work through. The woke ideology&#39;s
  conspicuous lack of interest in the working class is the
  tell-tale sign. Such fragments as are, er, left of the old
  left are anti-woke, and meanwhile the actual working class
  shifted to the populist right and gave us Trump. Trump and
  wokeness are cousins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The middle-class origins of wokeness smoothed its way
  through the institutions because it had no interest in
  &quot;seizing the means of production&quot; (how quaint such phrases
  seem now), which would quickly have run up against hard
  state and corporate power. The fact that wokeness only
  expressed interest in other kinds of class (race, sex,
  etc) signalled compromise with existing power: give us
  power within your system and we&#39;ll bestow the resource we
  control — moral rectitude — upon you. As an ideological
  stalking horse for gaining control over discourse and
  institutions, this succeeded where a more ambitious
  revolutionary program would not have.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
It helped that the humanities and social sciences also
included some of the biggest and easiest undergrad majors.
If a political movement had to start with physics students,
it could never get off the ground; there would be too few of
them, and they wouldn&#39;t have the time to spare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the top universities these majors are not as big as they
used to be, though. A 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/06/the-end-of-the-english-major&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;2022 survey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that only 7% of
Harvard undergrads plan to major in the humanities, vs
nearly 30% during the 1970s. I expect wokeness is at least
part of the reason; when undergrads consider majoring in
English, it&#39;s presumably because they love the written word
and not because they want to listen to lectures about
racism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The puppet-master-and-puppet character of political
correctness became clearly visible when a bakery near
Oberlin College was falsely accused of race discrimination
in 2016. In the subsequent civil trial, lawyers for the
bakery produced a text message from Oberlin Dean of Students
Meredith Raimondo that read &quot;I&#39;d say unleash the students if
I wasn&#39;t convinced this needs to be put behind us.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The woke sometimes claim that wokeness is simply
treating people with respect. But if it were, that would be
the only rule you&#39;d have to remember, and this is comically
far from being the case. My younger son likes to imitate
voices, and at one point when he was about seven I had to
explain which accents it was currently safe to imitate
publicly and which not. It took about ten minutes, and I
still hadn&#39;t covered all the cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
In 1986 the Supreme Court ruled that creating a
hostile work environment could constitute sex
discrimination, which in turn affected universities via
Title IX. The court specified that the test of a hostile
environment was whether it would bother a reasonable person,
but since for a professor merely being the subject of a
sexual harassment complaint would be a disaster whether the
complainant was reasonable or not, in practice any joke or
remark remotely connected with sex was now effectively
forbidden. Which meant we&#39;d now come full circle to
Victorian codes of behavior, when there was a large class of
things that might not be said &quot;with ladies present.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f6n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Much as they tried to pretend there was no conflict
between diversity and quality. But you can&#39;t simultaneously
optimize for two things that aren&#39;t identical. What
diversity actually means, judging from the way the term is
used, is proportional representation, and unless you&#39;re
selecting a group whose purpose is to be representative,
like poll respondents, optimizing for proportional
representation has to come at the expense of quality. This
is not because of anything about representation; it&#39;s the
nature of optimization; optimizing for x has to come at the
expense of y unless x and y are identical.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f7n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Maybe societies will eventually develop antibodies to
viral outrage. Maybe we were just the first to be exposed to
it, so it tore through us like an epidemic through a
previously isolated population. I&#39;m fairly confident that it
would be possible to create new social media apps that were
less driven by outrage, and an app of this type would have a
good chance of stealing users from existing ones, because
the smartest people would tend to migrate to it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f8n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I say &quot;mostly&quot; because I have hopes that journalistic
neutrality will return in some form. There is some market
for unbiased news, and while it may be small, it&#39;s valuable.
The rich and powerful want to know what&#39;s really going on;
that&#39;s how they became rich and powerful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f9n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The Times made this momentous announcement very
informally, in passing in the middle of an 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/business/media/new-york-times-rukmini-callimachi-caliphate.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;article&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about a
Times reporter who&#39;d been criticized for inaccuracy. It&#39;s
quite possible no senior editor even approved it. But it&#39;s
somehow appropriate that this particular universe ended with
a whimper rather than a bang.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f10n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;10&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
As the acronym DEI goes out of fashion, many of these
bureaucrats will try to go underground by changing their
titles. It looks like &quot;belonging&quot; will be a popular option.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f11n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;11&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
If you&#39;ve ever wondered why our legal system includes
protections like the separation of prosecutor, judge, and
jury, the right to examine evidence and cross-examine
witnesses, and the right to be represented by legal counsel,
the de facto 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/magazine/title-ix-sexual-harassment-accusations.html&quot;&gt;parallel legal system&lt;/a&gt;
established by Title IX
makes that all too clear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f12n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;12&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The invention of new improprieties is most visible in
the rapid evolution of woke nomenclature. This is
particularly annoying to me as a writer, because the new
names are always worse. Any religious observance has to be
inconvenient and slightly absurd; otherwise gentiles would
do it too. So &quot;slaves&quot; becomes &quot;enslaved individuals.&quot; But
web search can show us the leading edge of moral growth in
real time: if you search for &quot;individuals experiencing
slavery&quot; you will as of this writing find five legit
attempts to use the phrase, and you&#39;ll even find two for
&quot;individuals experiencing enslavement.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f13n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;13&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Organizations that do dubious things are particularly
concerned with propriety, which is how you end up with
absurdities like tobacco and oil companies having higher ESG
ratings than Tesla.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f14n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;14&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Elon did something else that tilted Twitter rightward
though: he gave more visibility to paying users. Paying
users lean right on average, because people on the far left
dislike Elon and don&#39;t want to give him money. Elon
presumably knew this would happen. On the other hand, the
people on the far left have only themselves to blame; they
could tilt Twitter back to the left tomorrow if they wanted
to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f15n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;15&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
It even, as James Lindsay and Peter Boghossian
pointed out, has a concept of original sin: privilege. Which
means unlike Christianity&#39;s egalitarian version, people have varying
degrees of it. An able-bodied straight white
American male is born with such a load of sin that only by
the most abject repentance can he be saved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wokeness also shares something rather funny with many actual
versions of Christianity: like God, the people for whose
sake wokeness purports to act are often revolted by the
things done in their name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f16n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;16&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
There is one exception to most of these rules: actual
religious organizations. It&#39;s reasonable for them to insist
on orthodoxy. But they in turn should declare that they&#39;re
religious organizations. It&#39;s rightly considered shady
when something that appears to be an ordinary business or
publication turns out to be a religious organization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f17n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;17&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I don&#39;t want to give the impression that it will be
simple to roll back wokeness. There will be places where the
fight inevitably gets messy — particularly within
universities, which everyone has to share, yet which are
currently the most pervaded by wokeness of any institutions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f18n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;18&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
You can however get rid of aggressively
conventional-minded people within an organization, and in
many if not most organizations this would be an excellent
idea. Even a handful of them can do a lot of damage. I bet
you&#39;d feel a noticeable improvement going from a handful to
none.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;888888&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Sam Altman, 
Ben Miller, Daniel Gackle, Robin Hanson, Jessica
Livingston, Greg Lukianoff, Harj Taggar, Garry Tan, and Tim
Urban for reading drafts of this.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><link>http://paulgraham.com/woke.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://paulgraham.com/woke.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Writes and Write-Nots</title><description>October 2024&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m usually reluctant to make predictions about technology, but I
feel fairly confident about this one: in a couple decades there
won&#39;t be many people who can write.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the strangest things you learn if you&#39;re a writer is how
many people have trouble writing. Doctors know how many people have
a mole they&#39;re worried about; people who are good at setting up
computers know how many people aren&#39;t; writers know how many people
need help writing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason so many people have trouble writing is that it&#39;s
fundamentally difficult. To write well you have to think clearly,
and thinking clearly is hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yet writing pervades many jobs, and the more prestigious the
job, the more writing it tends to require.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These two powerful opposing forces, the pervasive expectation of
writing and the irreducible difficulty of doing it, create enormous
pressure. This is why eminent professors often turn out to have
resorted to plagiarism. The most striking thing to me about these
cases is the pettiness of the thefts. The stuff they steal is usually
the most mundane boilerplate — the sort of thing that anyone who
was even halfway decent at writing could turn out with no effort
at all. Which means they&#39;re not even halfway decent at writing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Till recently there was no convenient escape valve for the pressure
created by these opposing forces. You could pay someone to write
for you, like JFK, or plagiarize, like MLK, but if you couldn&#39;t buy
or steal words, you had to write them yourself. And as a result
nearly everyone who was expected to write had to learn how.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not anymore. AI has blown this world open. Almost all pressure to
write has dissipated. You can have AI do it for you, both in school
and at work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The result will be a world divided into writes and write-nots.
There will still be some people who can write. Some of us like it.
But the middle ground between those who are good at writing and
those who can&#39;t write at all will disappear. Instead of good writers,
ok writers, and people who can&#39;t write, there will just be good
writers and people who can&#39;t write.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is that so bad? Isn&#39;t it common for skills to disappear when
technology makes them obsolete? There aren&#39;t many blacksmiths left,
and it doesn&#39;t seem to be a problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, it&#39;s bad. The reason is something I mentioned earlier: writing
is thinking. In fact there&#39;s a kind of thinking that can only be
done by writing. You can&#39;t make this point better than Leslie Lamport
did:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  If you&#39;re thinking without writing, you only think you&#39;re thinking.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So a world divided into writes and write-nots is more dangerous
than it sounds. It will be a world of thinks and think-nots. I know
which half I want to be in, and I bet you do too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This situation is not unprecedented. In preindustrial times most
people&#39;s jobs made them strong. Now if you want to be strong, you
work out. So there are still strong people, but only those who
choose to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It will be the same with writing. There will still be smart people,
but only those who choose to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;888888&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Jessica Livingston, Ben Miller, 
and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><link>http://paulgraham.com/writes.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://paulgraham.com/writes.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2024 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>When To Do What You Love</title><description>September 2024&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s some debate about whether it&#39;s a good idea to &quot;follow your
passion.&quot; In fact the question is impossible to answer with a simple
yes or no. Sometimes you should and sometimes you shouldn&#39;t, but
the border between should and shouldn&#39;t is very complicated. The
only way to give a general answer is to trace it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When people talk about this question, there&#39;s always an implicit
&quot;instead of.&quot; All other things being equal, why wouldn&#39;t you work
on what interests you the most? So even raising the question implies
that all other things aren&#39;t equal, and that you have to choose
between working on what interests you the most and something else,
like what pays the best.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And indeed if your main goal is to make money, you can&#39;t usually
afford to work on what interests you the most. People pay you for
doing what they want, not what you want. But there&#39;s an obvious
exception: when you both want the same thing. For example, if you
love football, and you&#39;re good enough at it, you can get paid a lot
to play it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course the odds are against you in a case like football, because
so many other people like playing it too. This is not to say you
shouldn&#39;t try though. It depends how much ability you have and how
hard you&#39;re willing to work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The odds are better when you have strange tastes: when you like
something that pays well and that few other people like. For example,
it&#39;s clear that Bill Gates truly loved running a software company.
He didn&#39;t just love programming, which a lot of people do. He loved
writing software for customers. That is a very strange taste indeed,
but if you have it, you can make a lot by indulging it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are even some people who have a genuine intellectual interest
in making money. This is distinct from mere greed. They just can&#39;t
help noticing when something is mispriced, and can&#39;t help doing
something about it. It&#39;s like a puzzle for them.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/when.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact there&#39;s an edge case here so spectacular that it turns all
the preceding advice on its head. If you want to make a really 
huge
amount of money — hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars
— it turns out to be very useful to work on what interests you the
most. The reason is not the extra motivation you get from doing
this, but that the way to make a really large amount of money is
to start a startup, and working on what interests you is an excellent
way to discover &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;startup ideas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many if not most of the biggest startups began as projects the
founders were doing for fun. Apple, Google, and Facebook all began
that way. Why is this pattern so common? Because the best ideas
tend to be such outliers that you&#39;d overlook them if you were
consciously looking for ways to make money. Whereas if you&#39;re young
and good at technology, your unconscious instincts about what would
be interesting to work on are very well aligned with what needs to
be built.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So there&#39;s something like a midwit peak for making money. If you
don&#39;t need to make much, you can work on whatever you&#39;re most
interested in; if you want to become moderately rich, you can&#39;t
usually afford to; but if you want to become super rich, and you&#39;re
young and good at technology, working on what you&#39;re most interested
in becomes a good idea again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What if you&#39;re not sure what you want? What if you&#39;re attracted to
the idea of making money and more attracted to some kinds of work
than others, but neither attraction predominates? How do you break
ties?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The key here is to understand that such ties are only apparent.
When you have trouble choosing between following your interests and
making money, it&#39;s never because you have complete knowledge of
yourself and of the types of work you&#39;re choosing between, and the
options are perfectly balanced. When you can&#39;t decide which path
to take, it&#39;s almost always due to ignorance. In fact you&#39;re usually
suffering from three kinds of ignorance simultaneously: you don&#39;t
know what makes you happy, what the various kinds of work are really
like, or how well you could do them. 
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/when.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a way this ignorance is excusable. It&#39;s often hard to predict
these things, and no one even tells you that you need to. If you&#39;re
ambitious you&#39;re told you should go to college, and this is good
advice so far as it goes, but that&#39;s where it usually ends. No one
tells you how to figure out what to work on, or how hard this can
be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you do in the face of uncertainty? Get more certainty. And
probably the best way to do that is to try working on things you&#39;re
interested in. That will get you more information about how interested
you are in them, how good you are at them, and how much scope they
offer for ambition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t wait. Don&#39;t wait till the end of college to figure out what
to work on. Don&#39;t even wait for internships during college. You
don&#39;t necessarily need a job doing x in order to work on x; often
you can just start doing it in some form yourself. And since figuring
out what to work on is a problem that could take years to solve,
the sooner you start, the better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One useful trick for judging different kinds of work is to look at
who your colleagues will be. You&#39;ll become like whoever you work
with. Do you want to become like these people?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, the difference in character between different kinds of work
is magnified by the fact that everyone else is facing the same
decisions as you. If you choose a kind of work mainly for how well
it pays, you&#39;ll be surrounded by other people who chose it for the
same reason, and that will make it even more soul-sucking than it
seems from the outside. Whereas if you choose work you&#39;re genuinely
interested in, you&#39;ll be surrounded mostly by other people who are
genuinely interested in it, and that will make it extra inspiring.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/when.html#f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other thing you do in the face of uncertainty is to make choices
that are uncertainty-proof. The less sure you are about what to do,
the more important it is to choose options that give you more options
in the future. I call this &quot;staying upwind.&quot; If you&#39;re unsure whether
to major in math or economics, for example, choose math; math is
upwind of economics in the sense that it will be easier to switch
later from math to economics than from economics to math.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s one case, though, where it&#39;s easy to say whether you should
work on what interests you the most: if you want to do 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;great work&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
This is not a sufficient condition for doing great work, but it is
a necessary one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s a lot of selection bias in advice about whether to &quot;follow
your passion,&quot; and this is the reason. Most such advice comes from
people who are famously successful, and if you ask someone who&#39;s
famously successful how to do what they did, most will tell you
that you have to work on what you&#39;re most interested in. And this
is in fact true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the right advice for everyone. Not everyone
can do great work, or wants to. But if you do want to, the complicated
question of whether or not to work on what interests you the most
becomes simple. The answer is yes. The root of great work is a sort
of ambitious curiosity, and you can&#39;t manufacture that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
These examples show why it&#39;s a mistake to assume that economic
inequality must be evidence of some kind of brokenness or unfairness.
It&#39;s obvious that different people have different interests, and
that some interests yield far more money than others, so how can
it not be obvious that some people will end up much richer than
others? In a world where some people like to write enterprise
software and others like to make studio pottery, economic inequality
is the natural outcome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Difficulty choosing between interests is a different matter.
That&#39;s not always due to ignorance. It&#39;s often intrinsically
difficult. I still have trouble doing it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
You can&#39;t always take people at their word on this. Since
it&#39;s more prestigious to work on things you&#39;re interested in than
to be driven by money, people who are driven mainly by money will
often claim to be more interested in their work than they actually
are. One way to test such claims is by doing the following thought
experiment: if their work didn&#39;t pay well, would they take day jobs
doing something else in order to do it in their spare time? Lots
of mathematicians and scientists and engineers would. Historically
lots &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt;. But I don&#39;t think as many investment bankers would.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This thought experiment is also useful for distinguishing between
university departments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;888888&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit,

was there will remember. Most founders I talked to afterward said
it was the best they&#39;d ever heard. Ron Conway, for the first time
in his life, forgot to take notes. I&#39;m not going to try to reproduce
it here. Instead I want to talk about a question it raised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The theme of Brian&#39;s talk was that the conventional wisdom about
how to run larger companies is mistaken. As Airbnb grew, well-meaning
people advised him that he had to run the company in a certain way
for it to scale. Their advice could be optimistically summarized
as &quot;hire good people and give them room to do their jobs.&quot; He
followed this advice and the results were disastrous. So he had to
figure out a better way on his own, which he did partly by studying
how Steve Jobs ran Apple. So far it seems to be working. Airbnb&#39;s
free cash flow margin is now among the best in Silicon Valley.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The audience at this event included a lot of the most successful
founders we&#39;ve funded, and one after another said that the same
thing had happened to them. They&#39;d been given the same advice about
how to run their companies as they grew, but instead of helping
their companies, it had damaged them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why was everyone telling these founders the wrong thing? That was
the big mystery to me. And after mulling it over for a bit I figured
out the answer: what they were being told was how to run a company
you hadn&#39;t founded — how to run a company if you&#39;re merely a
professional manager. But this m.o. is so much less effective that
to founders it feels broken. There are things founders can do that
managers can&#39;t, and not doing them feels wrong to founders, because
it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In effect there are two different ways to run a company: founder
mode and manager mode. Till now most people even in Silicon Valley
have implicitly assumed that scaling a startup meant switching to
manager mode. But we can infer the existence of another mode from
the dismay of founders who&#39;ve tried it, and the success of their
attempts to escape from it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are as far as I know no books specifically about founder mode.
Business schools don&#39;t know it exists. All we have so far are the
experiments of individual founders who&#39;ve been figuring it out for
themselves. But now that we know what we&#39;re looking for, we can
search for it. I hope in a few years founder mode will be as well
understood as manager mode. We can already guess at some of the
ways it will differ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The way managers are taught to run companies seems to be like modular
design in the sense that you treat subtrees of the org chart as
black boxes. You tell your direct reports what to do, and it&#39;s up
to them to figure out how. But you don&#39;t get involved in the details
of what they do. That would be micromanaging them, which is bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hire good people and give them room to do their jobs. Sounds great
when it&#39;s described that way, doesn&#39;t it? Except in practice, judging
from the report of founder after founder, what this often turns out
to mean is: hire professional fakers and let them drive the company
into the ground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One theme I noticed both in Brian&#39;s talk and when talking to founders
afterward was the idea of being gaslit. Founders feel like they&#39;re
being gaslit from both sides — by the people telling them they
have to run their companies like managers, and by the people working
for them when they do. Usually when everyone around you disagrees
with you, your default assumption should be that you&#39;re mistaken.
But this is one of the rare exceptions. VCs who haven&#39;t been founders
themselves don&#39;t know how founders should run companies, and C-level
execs, as a class, include some of the most skillful liars in the
world.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whatever founder mode consists of, it&#39;s pretty clear that it&#39;s going
to break the principle that the CEO should engage with the company
only via his or her direct reports. &quot;Skip-level&quot; meetings will
become the norm instead of a practice so unusual that there&#39;s a
name for it. And once you abandon that constraint there are a huge
number of permutations to choose from.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, Steve Jobs used to run an annual retreat for what he
considered the 100 most important people at Apple, and these were
not the 100 people highest on the org chart. Can you imagine the
force of will it would take to do this at the average company? And
yet imagine how useful such a thing could be. It could make a big
company feel like a startup. Steve presumably wouldn&#39;t have kept
having these retreats if they didn&#39;t work. But I&#39;ve never heard of
another company doing this. So is it a good idea, or a bad one? We
still don&#39;t know. That&#39;s how little we know about founder mode.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Obviously founders can&#39;t keep running a 2000 person company the way
they ran it when it had 20. There&#39;s going to have to be some amount
of delegation. Where the borders of autonomy end up, and how sharp
they are, will probably vary from company to company. They&#39;ll even
vary from time to time within the same company, as managers earn
trust. So founder mode will be more complicated than manager mode.
But it will also work better. We already know that from the examples
of individual founders groping their way toward it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, another prediction I&#39;ll make about founder mode is that
once we figure out what it is, we&#39;ll find that a number of individual
founders were already most of the way there — except that in doing
what they did they were regarded by many as eccentric or worse.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html#f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Curiously enough it&#39;s an encouraging thought that we still know so
little about founder mode. Look at what founders have achieved
already, and yet they&#39;ve achieved this against a headwind of bad
advice. Imagine what they&#39;ll do once we can tell them how to run
their companies like Steve Jobs instead of John Sculley.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The more diplomatic way of phrasing this statement would be
to say that experienced C-level execs are often very skilled at
managing up. And I don&#39;t think anyone with knowledge of this world
would dispute that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
If the practice of having such retreats became so widespread
that even mature companies dominated by politics started to do it,
we could quantify the senescence of companies by the average depth
on the org chart of those invited.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I also have another less optimistic prediction: as soon as
the concept of founder mode becomes established, people will start
misusing it. Founders who are unable to delegate even things they
should will use founder mode as the excuse. Or managers who aren&#39;t
founders will decide they should try to act like founders. That may
even work, to some extent, but the results will be messy when it
doesn&#39;t; the modular approach does at least limit the damage a bad
CEO can do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;888888&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Brian Chesky, Patrick Collison,

New ideas often don&#39;t work
at first, but they&#39;re not deterred. They keep trying and eventually
find something that does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mere obstinacy, on the other hand, is a recipe for failure. Obstinate
people are so annoying. They won&#39;t listen. They beat their heads
against a wall and get nowhere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But is there any real difference between these two cases? Are
persistent and obstinate people actually behaving differently? Or
are they doing the same thing, and we just label them later as
persistent or obstinate depending on whether they turned out to be
right or not?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If that&#39;s the only difference then there&#39;s nothing to be learned
from the distinction. Telling someone to be persistent rather than
obstinate would just be telling them to be right rather than wrong,
and they already know that. Whereas if persistence and obstinacy
are actually different kinds of behavior, it would be worthwhile
to tease them apart.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/persistence.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve talked to a lot of determined people, and it seems to me that
they&#39;re different kinds of behavior. I&#39;ve often walked away from a
conversation thinking either &quot;Wow, that guy is determined&quot; or &quot;Damn,
that guy is stubborn,&quot; and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m just talking about
whether they seemed right or not. That&#39;s part of it, but not all
of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s something annoying about the obstinate that&#39;s not simply
due to being mistaken. They won&#39;t listen. And that&#39;s not true of
all determined people. I can&#39;t think of anyone more determined than
the Collison brothers, and when you point out a problem to them,
they not only listen, but listen with an almost predatory intensity.
Is there a hole in the bottom of their boat? Probably not, but if
there is, they want to know about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s the same with most successful people. They&#39;re never &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt;
engaged than when you disagree with them. Whereas the obstinate
don&#39;t want to hear you. When you point out problems, their eyes
glaze over, and their replies sound like ideologues talking about
matters of doctrine.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/persistence.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason the persistent and the obstinate seem similar is that
they&#39;re both hard to stop. But they&#39;re hard to stop in different
senses. The persistent are like boats whose engines can&#39;t be throttled
back. The obstinate are like boats whose rudders can&#39;t be turned.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/persistence.html#f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the degenerate case they&#39;re indistinguishable: when there&#39;s only
one way to solve a problem, your only choice is whether to give up
or not, and persistence and obstinacy both say no. This is presumably
why the two are so often conflated in popular culture. It assumes
simple problems. But as problems get more complicated, we can see
the difference between them. The persistent are much more attached
to points high in the decision tree than to minor ones lower down,
while the obstinate spray &quot;don&#39;t give up&quot; indiscriminately over the
whole tree.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The persistent are attached to the goal. The obstinate are attached
to their ideas about how to reach it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Worse still, that means they&#39;ll tend to be attached to their &lt;i&gt;first&lt;/i&gt;
ideas about how to solve a problem, even though these are the least
informed by the experience of working on it. So the obstinate aren&#39;t
merely attached to details, but disproportionately likely to be
attached to wrong ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why are they like this? Why are the obstinate obstinate? One
possibility is that they&#39;re overwhelmed. They&#39;re not very capable.
They take on a hard problem. They&#39;re immediately in over their head.
So they grab onto ideas the way someone on the deck of a rolling
ship might grab onto the nearest handhold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was my initial theory, but on examination it doesn&#39;t hold up.
If being obstinate were simply a consequence of being in over one&#39;s
head, you could make persistent people become obstinate by making
them solve harder problems. But that&#39;s not what happens. If you
handed the Collisons an extremely hard problem to solve, they
wouldn&#39;t become obstinate. If anything they&#39;d become less obstinate.
They&#39;d know they had to be open to anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, if obstinacy were caused by the situation, the obstinate
would stop being obstinate when solving easier problems. But they
don&#39;t. And if obstinacy isn&#39;t caused by the situation, it must come
from within. It must be a feature of one&#39;s personality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Obstinacy is a reflexive resistance to changing one&#39;s ideas. This
is not identical with stupidity, but they&#39;re closely related. A
reflexive resistance to changing one&#39;s ideas becomes a sort of
induced stupidity as contrary evidence mounts. And obstinacy is a
form of not giving up that&#39;s easily practiced by the stupid. You
don&#39;t have to consider complicated tradeoffs; you just dig in your
heels. It even works, up to a point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact that obstinacy works for simple problems is an important
clue. Persistence and obstinacy aren&#39;t opposites. The relationship
between them is more like the relationship between the two kinds
of respiration we can do: aerobic respiration, and the anaerobic
respiration we inherited from our most distant ancestors. Anaerobic
respiration is a more primitive process, but it has its uses. When
you leap suddenly away from a threat, that&#39;s what you&#39;re using.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The optimal amount of obstinacy is not zero. It can be good if your
initial reaction to a setback is an unthinking &quot;I won&#39;t give up,&quot;
because this helps prevent panic. But unthinking only gets you so
far. The further someone is toward the obstinate end of the continuum,
the less likely they are to succeed in solving hard problems.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/persistence.html#f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Obstinacy is a simple thing. Animals have it. But persistence turns
out to have a fairly complicated internal structure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing that distinguishes the persistent is their energy. At the
risk of putting too much weight on words, they persist rather than
merely resisting. They keep trying things. Which means the persistent
must also be imaginative. To keep trying things, you have to keep
thinking of things to try.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Energy and imagination make a wonderful combination. Each gets the
best out of the other. Energy creates demand for the ideas produced
by imagination, which thus produces more, and imagination gives
energy somewhere to go.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/persistence.html#f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Merely having energy and imagination is quite rare. But to solve
hard problems you need three more qualities: resilience, good
judgement, and a focus on some kind of goal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Resilience means not having one&#39;s morale destroyed by setbacks.
Setbacks are inevitable once problems reach a certain size, so if
you can&#39;t bounce back from them, you can only do good work on a
small scale. But resilience is not the same as obstinacy. Resilience
means setbacks can&#39;t change your morale, not that they can&#39;t change
your mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, persistence often requires that one change one&#39;s mind.
That&#39;s where good judgement comes in. The persistent are quite
rational. They focus on expected value. It&#39;s this, not recklessness,
that lets them work on things that are unlikely to succeed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is one point at which the persistent are often irrational
though: at the very top of the decision tree. When they choose
between two problems of roughly equal expected value, the choice
usually comes down to personal preference. Indeed, they&#39;ll often
classify projects into deliberately wide bands of expected value
in order to ensure that the one they want to work on still qualifies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Empirically this doesn&#39;t seem to be a problem. It&#39;s ok to be
irrational near the top of the decision tree. One reason is that
we humans will work harder on a problem we love. But there&#39;s another
more subtle factor involved as well: our preferences among problems
aren&#39;t random. When we love a problem that other people don&#39;t, it&#39;s
often because we&#39;ve unconsciously noticed that it&#39;s more important
than they realize.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which leads to our fifth quality: there needs to be some overall
goal. If you&#39;re like me you began, as a kid, merely with the desire
to do something great. In theory that should be the most powerful
motivator of all, since it includes everything that could possibly
be done. But in practice it&#39;s not much use, precisely because it
includes too much. It doesn&#39;t tell you what to do at this moment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So in practice your energy and imagination and resilience and good
judgement have to be directed toward some fairly specific goal. Not
too specific, or you might miss a great discovery adjacent to what
you&#39;re searching for, but not too general, or it won&#39;t work to
motivate you.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/persistence.html#f6n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you look at the internal structure of persistence, it doesn&#39;t
resemble obstinacy at all. It&#39;s so much more complex. Five distinct
qualities — energy, imagination, resilience, good judgement, and
focus on a goal — combine to produce a phenomenon that seems a bit
like obstinacy in the sense that it causes you not to give up. But
the way you don&#39;t give up is completely different. Instead of merely
resisting change, you&#39;re driven toward a goal by energy and resilience,
through paths discovered by imagination and optimized by judgement.
You&#39;ll give way on any point low down in the decision tree, if its
expected value drops sufficiently, but energy and resilience keep
pushing you toward whatever you chose higher up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Considering what it&#39;s made of, it&#39;s not surprising that the right
kind of stubbornness is so much rarer than the wrong kind, or that
it gets so much better results. Anyone can do obstinacy. Indeed,
kids and drunks and fools are best at it. Whereas very few people
have enough of all five of the qualities that produce the right kind
of stubbornness, but when they do the results are magical.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I&#39;m going to use &quot;persistent&quot; for the good kind of stubborn
and &quot;obstinate&quot; for the bad kind, but I can&#39;t claim I&#39;m simply
following current usage. Conventional opinion barely distinguishes
between good and bad kinds of stubbornness, and usage is correspondingly
promiscuous. I could have invented a new word for the good kind,
but it seemed better just to stretch &quot;persistent.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
There are some domains where one can succeed by being obstinate.
Some political leaders have been notorious for it. But it won&#39;t
work in situations where you have to pass external tests. And indeed
the political leaders who are famous for being obstinate are famous
for getting power, not for using it well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
There will be some resistance to turning the rudder of a
persistent person, because there&#39;s some cost to changing direction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The obstinate do sometimes succeed in solving hard problems.
One way is through luck: like the stopped clock that&#39;s right twice
a day, they seize onto some arbitrary idea, and it turns out to be
right. Another is when their obstinacy cancels out some other form
of error. For example, if a leader has overcautious subordinates,
their estimates of the probability of success will always be off
in the same direction. So if he mindlessly says &quot;push ahead regardless&quot;
in every borderline case, he&#39;ll usually turn out to be right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
If you stop there, at just energy and imagination, you get
the conventional caricature of an artist or poet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f6n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Start by erring on the small side. If you&#39;re inexperienced
you&#39;ll inevitably err on one side or the other, and if you err on
the side of making the goal too broad, you won&#39;t get anywhere.
Whereas if you err on the small side you&#39;ll at least be moving
forward. Then, once you&#39;re moving, you expand the goal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;888888&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Trevor Blackwell,

In fact they
were one of the reasons we started it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;YC grew out of a talk I gave to the Harvard Computer Society (the
undergrad computer club) about how to start a startup. Everyone
else in the audience was probably local, but Steve and Alexis came
up on the train from the University of Virginia, where they were
seniors. Since they&#39;d come so far I agreed to meet them for coffee.
They told me about the startup idea we&#39;d later fund them to drop:
a way to order fast food on your cellphone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was before smartphones. They&#39;d have had to make deals with
cell carriers and fast food chains just to get it launched. So it
was not going to happen. It still doesn&#39;t exist, 19 years later.
But I was impressed with their brains and their energy. In fact I
was so impressed with them and some of the other people I met at
that talk that I decided to start something to fund them. A few
days later I told Steve and Alexis that we were starting Y&amp;nbsp;Combinator,
and encouraged them to apply.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That first batch we didn&#39;t have any way to identify applicants, so
we made up nicknames for them. The Reddits were the &quot;Cell food
muffins.&quot; &quot;Muffin&quot; is a term of endearment Jessica uses for things
like small dogs and two year olds. So that gives you some idea what
kind of impression Steve and Alexis made in those days. They had
the look of slightly ruffled surprise that baby birds have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their idea was bad though. And since we thought then that we were
funding ideas rather than founders, we rejected them. But we felt
bad about it. Jessica was sad that we&#39;d rejected the muffins. And
it seemed wrong to me to turn down the people we&#39;d been inspired
to start YC to fund.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t think the startup sense of the word &quot;pivot&quot; had been invented
yet, but we wanted to fund Steve and Alexis, so if their idea was
bad, they&#39;d have to work on something else. And I knew what else.
In those days there was a site called Delicious where you could
save links. It had a page called del.icio.us/popular that listed
the most-saved links, and people were using this page as a de facto
Reddit. I knew because a lot of the traffic to my site was coming
from it. There needed to be something like del.icio.us/popular, but
designed for sharing links instead of being a byproduct of saving
them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I called Steve and Alexis and said that we liked them, just not
their idea, so we&#39;d fund them if they&#39;d work on something else.
They were on the train home to Virginia at that point. They got off
at the next station and got on the next train north, and by the end
of the day were committed to working on what&#39;s now called Reddit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They would have liked to call it Snoo, as in &quot;What snoo?&quot; But
snoo.com was too expensive, so they settled for calling the mascot
Snoo and picked a name for the site that wasn&#39;t registered. Early
on Reddit was just a provisional name, or so they told me at least,
but it&#39;s probably too late to change it now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As with all the really great startups, there&#39;s an uncannily close
match between the company and the founders. Steve in particular.
Reddit has a certain personality — curious, skeptical, ready to
be amused — and that personality is Steve&#39;s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Steve will roll his eyes at this, but he&#39;s an intellectual; he&#39;s
interested in ideas for their own sake. That was how he came to be
in that audience in Cambridge in the first place. He knew me because
he was interested in a programming language I&#39;ve written about
called Lisp, and Lisp is one of those languages few people learn
except out of intellectual curiosity. Steve&#39;s kind of vacuum-cleaner
curiosity is exactly what you want when you&#39;re starting a site
that&#39;s a list of links to literally anything interesting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Steve was not a big fan of authority, so he also liked the idea of
a site without editors. In those days the top forum for programmers
was a site called Slashdot. It was a lot like Reddit, except the
stories on the frontpage were chosen by human moderators. And though
they did a good job, that one small difference turned out to be a
big difference. Being driven by user submissions meant Reddit was
fresher than Slashdot. News there was newer, and users will always
go where the newest news is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I pushed the Reddits to launch fast. A version one didn&#39;t need to
be more than a couple hundred lines of code. How could that take
more than a week or two to build? And they did launch comparatively
fast, about three weeks into the first YC batch. The first users
were Steve, Alexis, me, and some of their YC batchmates and college
friends. It turns out you don&#39;t need that many users to collect a
decent list of interesting links, especially if you have multiple
accounts per user.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reddit got two more people from their YC batch: Chris Slowe and
Aaron Swartz, and they too were unusually smart. Chris was just
finishing his PhD in physics at Harvard. Aaron was younger, a college
freshman, and even more anti-authority than Steve. It&#39;s not
exaggerating to describe him as a martyr for what authority later
did to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slowly but inexorably Reddit&#39;s traffic grew. At first the numbers
were so small they were hard to distinguish from background noise.
But within a few weeks it was clear that there was a core of real
users returning regularly to the site. And although all kinds of
things have happened to Reddit the company in the years since,
Reddit the &lt;i&gt;site&lt;/i&gt; never looked back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reddit the site (and now app) is such a fundamentally useful thing
that it&#39;s almost unkillable. Which is why, despite a long stretch
after Steve left when the management strategy ranged from benign
neglect to spectacular blunders, traffic just kept growing. You
can&#39;t do that with most companies. Most companies you take your eye
off the ball for six months and you&#39;re in deep trouble. But Reddit
was special, and when Steve came back in 2015, I knew the world was
in for a surprise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People thought they had Reddit&#39;s number: one of the players in
Silicon Valley, but not one of the big ones. But those who knew
what had been going on behind the scenes knew there was more to the
story than this. If Reddit could grow to the size it had with
management that was harmless at best, what could it do if Steve
came back? We now know the answer to that question. Or at least a
lower bound on the answer. Steve is not out of ideas yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><link>http://paulgraham.com/reddits.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://paulgraham.com/reddits.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>How to Start Google</title><description>March 2024&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(This is a talk I gave to 14 and 15 year olds about what to do now
if they might want to start a startup later. Lots of schools think
they should tell students something about startups. This is what I
think they should tell them.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of you probably think that when you&#39;re released into the
so-called real world you&#39;ll eventually have to get some kind of
job. That&#39;s not true, and today I&#39;m going to talk about a trick you
can use to avoid ever having to get a job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trick is to start your own company. So it&#39;s not a trick for
avoiding &lt;i&gt;work&lt;/i&gt;, because if you start your own company you&#39;ll
work harder than you would if you had an ordinary job. But you will
avoid many of the annoying things that come with a job, including
a boss telling you what to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s more exciting to work on your own project than someone else&#39;s.
And you can also get a lot richer. In fact, this is the standard
way to get 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/richnow.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;really rich&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you look at the lists of the richest
people that occasionally get published in the press, nearly all of
them did it by starting their own companies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starting your own company can mean anything from starting a barber
shop to starting Google. I&#39;m here to talk about one extreme end of
that continuum. I&#39;m going to tell you how to start Google.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The companies at the Google end of the continuum are called startups
when they&#39;re young. The reason I know about them is that my wife
Jessica and I started something called Y Combinator that is basically
a startup factory. Since 2005, Y Combinator has funded over 4000
startups. So we know exactly what you need to start a startup,
because we&#39;ve helped people do it for the last 19 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You might have thought I was joking when I said I was going to tell
you how to start Google. You might be thinking &quot;How could &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt;
start Google?&quot; But that&#39;s effectively what the people who did start
Google were thinking before they started it. If you&#39;d told Larry
Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google, that the company they
were about to start would one day be worth over a trillion dollars,
their heads would have exploded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All you can know when you start working on a startup is that it
seems worth pursuing. You can&#39;t know whether it will turn into
a company worth billions or one that goes out of business. So when I
say I&#39;m going to tell you how to start Google, I mean I&#39;m going to
tell you how to get to the point where you can start a company that
has as much chance of being Google as Google had of being Google.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/google.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do you get from where you are now to the point where you can
start a successful startup? You need three things. You need to be
good at some kind of technology, you need an idea for what you&#39;re
going to build, and you need cofounders to start the company with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do you get good at technology? And how do you choose which
technology to get good at? Both of those questions turn out to have
the same answer: work on your own projects. Don&#39;t try to guess
whether gene editing or LLMs or rockets will turn out to be the
most valuable technology to know about. No one can predict that.
Just work on whatever interests you the most. You&#39;ll work much
harder on something you&#39;re interested in than something you&#39;re doing
because you think you&#39;re supposed to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&#39;re not sure what technology to get good at, get good at
programming. That has been the source of the median startup for the
last 30 years, and this is probably not going to change in the next
10.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those of you who are taking computer science classes in school may
at this point be thinking, ok, we&#39;ve got this sorted. We&#39;re already
being taught all about programming. But sorry, this is not enough.
You have to be working on your own projects, not just learning stuff
in classes. You can do well in computer science classes without
ever really learning to program. In fact you can graduate with a
degree in computer science from a top university and still not be
any good at programming. That&#39;s why tech companies all make you
take a coding test before they&#39;ll hire you, regardless of where you
went to university or how well you did there. They know grades and
exam results prove nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you really want to learn to program, you have to work on your
own projects. You learn so much faster that way. Imagine you&#39;re
writing a game and there&#39;s something you want to do in it, and you
don&#39;t know how. You&#39;re going to figure out how a lot faster than
you&#39;d learn anything in a class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You don&#39;t have to learn programming, though. If you&#39;re wondering
what counts as technology, it includes practically everything you
could describe using the words &quot;make&quot; or &quot;build.&quot; So welding would
count, or making clothes, or making videos. Whatever you&#39;re most
interested in. The critical distinction is whether you&#39;re producing
or just consuming. Are you writing computer games, or just playing
them? That&#39;s the cutoff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, spent time when he was a teenager
studying calligraphy — the sort of beautiful writing that
you see in medieval manuscripts. No one, including him, thought
that this would help him in his career. He was just doing it because
he was interested in it. But it turned out to help him a lot. The
computer that made Apple really big, the Macintosh, came out at
just the moment when computers got powerful enough to make letters
like the ones in printed books instead of the computery-looking
letters you see in 8 bit games. Apple destroyed everyone else at
this, and one reason was that Steve was one of the few people in
the computer business who really got graphic design.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t feel like your projects have to be &lt;i&gt;serious&lt;/i&gt;. They can
be as frivolous as you like, so long as you&#39;re building things
you&#39;re excited about. Probably 90% of programmers start out building
games. They and their friends like to play games. So they build
the kind of things they and their friends want. And that&#39;s exactly
what you should be doing at 15 if you want to start a startup one
day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You don&#39;t have to do just one project. In fact it&#39;s good to learn
about multiple things. Steve Jobs didn&#39;t just learn calligraphy.
He also learned about electronics, which was even more valuable.
Whatever you&#39;re interested in. (Do you notice a theme here?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So that&#39;s the first of the three things you need, to get good at
some kind or kinds of technology. You do it the same way you get
good at the violin or football: practice. If you start a startup
at 22, and you start writing your own programs now, then by the
time you start the company you&#39;ll have spent at least 7 years
practicing writing code, and you can get pretty good at anything
after practicing it for 7 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let&#39;s suppose you&#39;re 22 and you&#39;ve succeeded: You&#39;re now really
good at some technology. How do you get 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;startup ideas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? It might
seem like that&#39;s the hard part. Even if you are a good programmer,
how do you get the idea to start Google?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actually it&#39;s easy to get startup ideas once you&#39;re good at technology.
Once you&#39;re good at some technology, when you look at the world you
see dotted outlines around the things that are missing. You start
to be able to see both the things that are missing from the technology
itself, and all the broken things that could be fixed using it, and
each one of these is a potential startup.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the town near our house there&#39;s a shop with a sign warning that
the door is hard to close. The sign has been there for several
years. To the people in the shop it must seem like this mysterious
natural phenomenon that the door sticks, and all they can do is put
up a sign warning customers about it. But any carpenter looking at
this situation would think &quot;why don&#39;t you just plane off the part
that sticks?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once you&#39;re good at programming, all the missing software in the
world starts to become as obvious as a sticking door to a carpenter.
I&#39;ll give you a real world example. Back in the 20th century,
American universities used to publish printed directories with all
the students&#39; names and contact info. When I tell you what these
directories were called, you&#39;ll know which startup I&#39;m talking
about. They were called facebooks, because they usually had a picture
of each student next to their name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So Mark Zuckerberg shows up at Harvard in 2002, and the university
still hasn&#39;t gotten the facebook online. Each individual house has
an online facebook, but there isn&#39;t one for the whole university.
The university administration has been diligently having meetings
about this, and will probably have solved the problem in another
decade or so. Most of the students don&#39;t consciously notice that
anything is wrong. But Mark is a programmer. He looks at this
situation and thinks &quot;Well, this is stupid. I could write a program
to fix this in one night. Just let people upload their own photos
and then combine the data into a new site for the whole university.&quot;
So he does. And almost literally overnight he has thousands of
users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course Facebook was not a startup yet. It was just a... project.
There&#39;s that word again. Projects aren&#39;t just the best way to learn
about technology. They&#39;re also the best source of startup ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook was not unusual in this respect. Apple and Google also
began as projects. Apple wasn&#39;t meant to be a company. Steve Wozniak
just wanted to build his own computer. It only turned into a company
when Steve Jobs said &quot;Hey, I wonder if we could sell plans for this
computer to other people.&quot; That&#39;s how Apple started. They weren&#39;t
even selling computers, just plans for computers. Can you imagine
how lame this company seemed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ditto for Google. Larry and Sergey weren&#39;t trying to start a company
at first. They were just trying to make search better. Before Google,
most search engines didn&#39;t try to sort the results they gave you
in order of importance. If you searched for &quot;rugby&quot; they just gave
you every web page that contained the word &quot;rugby.&quot; And the web was
so small in 1997 that this actually worked! Kind of. There might
only be 20 or 30 pages with the word &quot;rugby,&quot; but the web was growing
exponentially, which meant this way of doing search was becoming
exponentially more broken. Most users just thought, &quot;Wow, I sure
have to look through a lot of search results to find what I want.&quot;
Door sticks. But like Mark, Larry and Sergey were programmers. Like
Mark, they looked at this situation and thought &quot;Well, this is
stupid. Some pages about rugby matter more than others. Let&#39;s figure
out which those are and show them first.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s obvious in retrospect that this was a great idea for a startup.
It wasn&#39;t obvious at the time. It&#39;s never obvious. If it was obviously
a good idea to start Apple or Google or Facebook, someone else would
have already done it. That&#39;s why the best startups grow out of
projects that aren&#39;t meant to be startups. You&#39;re not trying to
start a company. You&#39;re just following your instincts about what&#39;s
interesting. And if you&#39;re young and good at technology, then your
unconscious instincts about what&#39;s interesting are better than your
conscious ideas about what would be a good company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So it&#39;s critical, if you&#39;re a young founder, to build things for
yourself and your friends to use. The biggest mistake young founders
make is to build something for some mysterious group of other people.
But if you can make something that you and your friends truly want
to use — something your friends aren&#39;t just using out of
loyalty to you, but would be really sad to lose if you shut it down
— then you almost certainly have the germ of a good startup
idea. It may not seem like a startup to you. It may not be obvious
how to make money from it. But trust me, there&#39;s a way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What you need in a startup idea, and all you need, is something
your friends actually want. And those ideas aren&#39;t hard to see once
you&#39;re good at technology. There are sticking doors everywhere.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/google.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now for the third and final thing you need: a cofounder, or cofounders.
The optimal startup has two or three founders, so you need one or
two cofounders. How do you find them? Can you predict what I&#39;m going
to say next? It&#39;s the same thing: projects. You find cofounders by
working on projects with them. What you need in a cofounder is
someone who&#39;s good at what they do and that you work well with, and
the only way to judge this is to work with them on things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At this point I&#39;m going to tell you something you might not want
to hear. It really matters to do well in your classes, even the
ones that are just memorization or blathering about literature,
because you need to do well in your classes to get into a good
university. And if you want to start a startup you should try to
get into the best university you can, because that&#39;s where the best
cofounders are. It&#39;s also where the best employees are. When Larry
and Sergey started Google, they began by just hiring all the smartest
people they knew out of Stanford, and this was a real advantage for
them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The empirical evidence is clear on this. If you look at where the
largest numbers of successful startups come from, it&#39;s pretty much
the same as the list of the most selective universities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the prestigious names of these universities that
cause more good startups to come out of them. Nor do I think it&#39;s
because the quality of the teaching is better. What&#39;s driving this
is simply the difficulty of getting in. You have to be pretty smart
and determined to get into MIT or Cambridge, so if you do manage
to get in, you&#39;ll find the other students include a lot of smart
and determined people.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/google.html#f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You don&#39;t have to start a startup with someone you meet at university.
The founders of Twitch met when they were seven. The founders of
Stripe, Patrick and John Collison, met when John was born. But
universities are the main source of cofounders. And because they&#39;re
where the cofounders are, they&#39;re also where the ideas are, because
the best ideas grow out of projects you do with the people who
become your cofounders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the list of what you need to do to get from here to starting a
startup is quite short. You need to get good at technology, and the
way to do that is to work on your own projects. And you need to do
as well in school as you can, so you can get into a good university,
because that&#39;s where the cofounders and the ideas are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s it, just two things, build stuff and do well in school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The rhetorical trick in this sentence is that the &quot;Google&quot;s
refer to different things. What I mean is: a company that has as
much chance of growing as big as Google ultimately did as Larry and
Sergey could have reasonably expected Google itself would at the
time they started it. But I think the original version is zippier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Making something for your friends isn&#39;t the only source of
startup ideas. It&#39;s just the best source for young founders, who
have the least knowledge of what other people want, and whose own
wants are most predictive of future demand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Strangely enough this is particularly true in countries like
the US where undergraduate admissions are done badly. US admissions
departments make applicants jump through a lot of arbitrary hoops
that have little to do with their intellectual ability. But the
more arbitrary a test, the more it becomes a test of mere determination
and resourcefulness. And those are the two most important qualities
in startup founders. So US admissions departments are better at
selecting founders than they would be if they were better at selecting
students.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;888888&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Jared Friedman, Carolynn Levy, Jessica Livingston, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts of this.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><link>http://paulgraham.com/google.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://paulgraham.com/google.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Best Essay</title><description>March 2024&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite its title this isn&#39;t meant to be the best essay. My goal
here is to figure out what the best essay would be like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would be well-written, but you can write well about any topic.
What made it special would be what it was about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Obviously some topics would be better than others. It probably
wouldn&#39;t be about this year&#39;s lipstick colors. But it wouldn&#39;t be
vaporous talk about elevated themes either. A good essay has to be
surprising. It has to tell people something they don&#39;t already know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best essay would be on the most important topic you could tell
people something surprising about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That may sound obvious, but it has some unexpected consequences.
One is that science enters the picture like an elephant stepping
into a rowboat. For example, Darwin first described the idea of
natural selection in an essay written in 1844.
Talk about an
important topic you could tell people something surprising about.
If that&#39;s the test of a great essay, this was surely the best one
written in 1844. 
And indeed, the best possible essay at any given
time would usually be one describing the most important scientific
or technological discovery it was possible to make.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/best.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another unexpected consequence: I imagined when I started writing
this that the best essay would be fairly timeless — that the best
essay you could write in 1844 would be much the same as the best
one you could write now. But in fact the opposite seems to be true.
It might be true that the best painting would be timeless in this
sense. But it wouldn&#39;t be impressive to write an essay introducing
natural selection now. The best essay &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; would be one describing
a great discovery we didn&#39;t yet know about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the question of how to write the best possible essay reduces to
the question of how to make great discoveries, then I started with
the wrong question. Perhaps what this exercise shows is that we
shouldn&#39;t waste our time writing essays but instead focus on making
discoveries in some specific domain. But I&#39;m interested in essays
and what can be done with them, so I want to see if there&#39;s some
other question I could have asked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is, and on the face of it, it seems almost identical to the
one I started with. Instead of asking &lt;i&gt;what would the best essay
be?&lt;/i&gt; I should have asked &lt;i&gt;how do you write essays well?&lt;/i&gt; Though
these seem only phrasing apart, their answers diverge. The answer
to the first question, as we&#39;ve seen, isn&#39;t really about essay
writing. The second question forces it to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Writing essays, at its best, is a way of discovering ideas. How do
you do that well? How do you discover by writing?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An essay should ordinarily start with what I&#39;m going to call a
question, though I mean this in a very general sense: it doesn&#39;t
have to be a question grammatically, just something that acts like
one in the sense that it spurs some response.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do you get this initial question? It probably won&#39;t work to
choose some important-sounding topic at random and go at it.
Professional traders won&#39;t even trade unless they have what they
call an &lt;i&gt;edge&lt;/i&gt; — a convincing story about why in some class of
trades they&#39;ll win more than they lose. Similarly, you shouldn&#39;t
attack a topic unless you have a way in — some new insight about
it or way of approaching it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You don&#39;t need to have a complete thesis; you just need some kind
of gap you can explore. In fact, merely having questions about
something other people take for granted can be edge enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you come across a question that&#39;s sufficiently puzzling, it could
be worth exploring even if it doesn&#39;t seem very momentous. Many an
important discovery has been made by pulling on a thread that seemed
insignificant at first. How can they &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; be finches? 
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/best.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once you&#39;ve got a question, then what? You start thinking out loud
about it. Not literally out loud, but you commit to a specific
string of words in response, as you would if you were talking. This
initial response is usually mistaken or incomplete. Writing converts
your ideas from vague to bad. But that&#39;s a step forward, because
once you can see the brokenness, you can fix it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps beginning writers are alarmed at the thought of starting
with something mistaken or incomplete, but you shouldn&#39;t be, because
this is why essay writing works. Forcing yourself to commit to some
specific string of words gives you a starting point, and if it&#39;s
wrong, you&#39;ll see that when you reread it. At least half of essay
writing is rereading what you&#39;ve written and asking &lt;i&gt;is this correct
and complete?&lt;/i&gt; You have to be very strict when rereading, not just
because you want to keep yourself honest, but because a gap between
your response and the truth is often a sign of new ideas to be
discovered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The prize for being strict with what you&#39;ve written is not just
refinement. When you take a roughly correct answer and try to make
it exactly right, sometimes you find that you can&#39;t, and that the
reason is that you were depending on a false assumption. And when
you discard it, the answer turns out to be completely different.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/best.html#f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ideally the response to a question is two things: the first step
in a process that converges on the truth, and a source of additional
questions (in my very general sense of the word). So the process
continues recursively, as response spurs response. 
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/best.html#f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Usually there are several possible responses to a question, which
means you&#39;re traversing a tree. But essays are linear, not tree-shaped,
which means you have to choose one branch to follow at each point.
How do you choose? Usually you should follow whichever offers the
greatest combination of generality and novelty. I don&#39;t consciously
rank branches this way; I just follow whichever seems most exciting;
but generality and novelty are what make a branch exciting. 
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/best.html#f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&#39;re willing to do a lot of rewriting, you don&#39;t have to guess
right. You can follow a branch and see how it turns out, and if it
isn&#39;t good enough, cut it and backtrack. I do this all the time.
In this essay I&#39;ve already cut a 17-paragraph subtree, in addition
to countless shorter ones. Maybe I&#39;ll reattach it at the end, or
boil it down to a footnote, or spin it off as its own essay; we&#39;ll
see. 
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/best.html#f6n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In general you want to be quick to cut. One of the most dangerous
temptations in writing (and in software and painting) is to keep
something that isn&#39;t right, just because it contains a few good bits
or cost you a lot of effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most surprising new question being thrown off at this point is
&lt;i&gt;does it really matter what the initial question is?&lt;/i&gt; If the space
of ideas is highly connected, it shouldn&#39;t, because you should be
able to get from any question to the most valuable ones in a few
hops. And we see evidence that it&#39;s highly connected in the way,
for example, that people who are obsessed with some topic can turn
any conversation toward it. But that only works if you know where
you want to go, and you don&#39;t in an essay. That&#39;s the whole point.
You don&#39;t want to be the obsessive conversationalist, or all your
essays will be about the same thing. 
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/best.html#f7n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other reason the initial question matters is that you usually
feel somewhat obliged to stick to it. I don&#39;t think about this when
I decide which branch to follow. I just follow novelty and generality.
Sticking to the question is enforced later, when I notice I&#39;ve
wandered too far and have to backtrack. But I think this is
the optimal solution. You don&#39;t want the hunt for novelty and
generality to be constrained in the moment. Go with it and see what
you get.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/best.html#f8n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the initial question does constrain you, in the best case it
sets an upper bound on the quality of essay you&#39;ll write. If you
do as well as you possibly can on the chain of thoughts that follow
from the initial question, the initial question itself is the only
place where there&#39;s room for variation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would be a mistake to let this make you too conservative though,
because you can&#39;t predict where a question will lead. Not if you&#39;re
doing things right, because doing things right means making
discoveries, and by definition you can&#39;t predict those. So the way
to respond to this situation is not to be cautious about which
initial question you choose, but to write a lot of essays. Essays
are for taking risks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost any question can get you a good essay. Indeed, it took some
effort to think of a sufficiently unpromising topic in the third
paragraph, because any essayist&#39;s first impulse on hearing that the
best essay couldn&#39;t be about x would be to try to write it. But if
most questions yield good essays, only some yield great ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can we predict which questions will yield great essays? Considering
how long I&#39;ve been writing essays, it&#39;s alarming how novel that
question feels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing I like in an initial question is outrageousness. I love
questions that seem naughty in some way — for example, by seeming
counterintuitive or overambitious or heterodox. Ideally all three.
This essay is an example. Writing about the best essay implies there
is such a thing, which pseudo-intellectuals will dismiss as reductive,
though it follows necessarily from the possibility of one essay
being better than another. And thinking about how to do something
so ambitious is close enough to doing it that it holds your attention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I like to start an essay with a gleam in my eye. This could be just
a taste of mine, but there&#39;s one aspect of it that probably isn&#39;t:
to write a really good essay on some topic, you have to be interested
in it. A good writer can write well about anything, but to stretch
for the novel insights that are the raison d&#39;etre of the essay, you
have to care.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If caring about it is one of the criteria for a good initial question,
then the optimal question varies from person to person. It also
means you&#39;re more likely to write great essays if you care about a
lot of different things. The more curious you are, the greater the
probable overlap between the set of things you&#39;re curious about and
the set of topics that yield great essays.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What other qualities would a great initial question have? It&#39;s
probably good if it has implications in a lot of different areas.
And I find it&#39;s a good sign if it&#39;s one that people think has already
been thoroughly explored. But the truth is that I&#39;ve barely thought
about how to choose initial questions, because I rarely do it. I
rarely &lt;i&gt;choose&lt;/i&gt; what to write about; I just start thinking about
something, and sometimes it turns into an essay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Am I going to stop writing essays about whatever I happen to be
thinking about and instead start working my way through some
systematically generated list of topics? That doesn&#39;t sound like
much fun. And yet I want to write good essays, and if the initial
question matters, I should care about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps the answer is to go one step earlier: to write about whatever
pops into your head, but try to ensure that what pops into your
head is good. Indeed, now that I think about it, this has to be the
answer, because a mere list of topics wouldn&#39;t be any use if you
didn&#39;t have edge with any of them. To start writing an essay, you
need a topic plus some initial insight about it, and you can&#39;t
generate those systematically. If only. 
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/best.html#f9n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can probably cause yourself to have more of them, though. The
quality of the ideas that come out of your head depends on what goes
in, and you can improve that in two dimensions, breadth and depth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can&#39;t learn everything, so getting breadth implies learning
about topics that are very different from one another. When I tell
people about my book-buying trips to Hay and they ask what I buy
books about, I usually feel a bit sheepish answering, because the
topics seem like a laundry list of unrelated subjects. But perhaps
that&#39;s actually optimal in this business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can also get ideas by talking to people, by doing and building
things, and by going places and seeing things. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s
important to talk to new people so much as the sort of people who
make you have new ideas. I get more new ideas after talking for an
afternoon with Robert Morris than from talking to 20 new smart
people. I know because that&#39;s what a block of office hours at Y
Combinator consists of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While breadth comes from reading and talking and seeing, depth comes
from doing. The way to really learn about some domain is to have
to solve problems in it. Though this could take the form of writing,
I suspect that to be a good essayist you also have to do, or have
done, some other kind of work. That may not be true for most other
fields, but essay writing is different. You could spend half your
time working on something else and be net ahead, so long as it was
hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m not proposing that as a recipe so much as an encouragement to
those already doing it. If you&#39;ve spent all your life so far working
on other things, you&#39;re already halfway there. Though of course to
be good at writing you have to like it, and if you like writing
you&#39;d probably have spent at least some time doing it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything I&#39;ve said about initial questions applies also to the
questions you encounter in writing the essay. They&#39;re the same
thing; every subtree of an essay is usually a shorter essay, just
as every subtree of a Calder mobile is a smaller mobile. So any
technique that gets you good initial questions also gets you good
whole essays.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At some point the cycle of question and response reaches what feels
like a natural end. Which is a little suspicious; shouldn&#39;t every
answer suggest more questions? I think what happens is that you
start to feel sated. Once you&#39;ve covered enough interesting ground,
you start to lose your appetite for new questions. Which is just
as well, because the reader is probably feeling sated too. And it&#39;s
not lazy to stop asking questions, because you could instead be
asking the initial question of a new essay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s the ultimate source of drag on the connectedness of ideas:
the discoveries you make along the way. If you discover enough
starting from question A, you&#39;ll never make it to question B. Though
if you keep writing essays you&#39;ll gradually fix this problem by
burning off such discoveries. So bizarrely enough, writing lots of
essays makes it as if the space of ideas were more highly connected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a subtree comes to an end, you can do one of two things. You
can either stop, or pull the Cubist trick of laying separate subtrees
end to end by returning to a question you skipped earlier. Usually
it requires some sleight of hand to make the essay flow continuously
at this point, but not this time. This time I actually need an
example of the phenomenon. For example, we discovered earlier that
the best possible essay wouldn&#39;t usually be timeless in the way the
best painting would. This seems surprising enough to be
worth investigating further.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are two senses in which an essay can be timeless: to be about
a matter of permanent importance, and always to have the same effect
on readers. With art these two senses blend together. Art that
looked beautiful to the ancient Greeks still looks beautiful to us.
But with essays the two senses diverge, because essays
teach, and you can&#39;t teach people something they already know.
Natural selection is certainly a matter of permanent importance,
but an essay explaining it couldn&#39;t have the same effect on us that
it would have had on Darwin&#39;s contemporaries, precisely because his
ideas were so successful that everyone already knows about them.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/best.html#f10n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;10&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I imagined when I started writing this that the best possible essay
would be timeless in the stricter, evergreen sense: that it would
contain some deep, timeless wisdom that would appeal equally to
Aristotle and Feynman. That doesn&#39;t seem to be true. But if the
best possible essay wouldn&#39;t usually be timeless in this stricter
sense, what would it take to write essays that were?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The answer to that turns out to be very strange: to be the evergreen
kind of timeless, an essay has to be ineffective, in the sense that
its discoveries aren&#39;t assimilated into our shared culture. Otherwise
there will be nothing new in it for the second generation of readers.
If you want to surprise readers not just now but in the future as
well, you have to write essays that won&#39;t stick — essays that,
no matter how good they are, won&#39;t become part of what people in
the future learn before they read them. 
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/best.html#f11n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;11&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can imagine several ways to do that. One would be to write about
things people never learn. For example, it&#39;s a long-established
pattern for ambitious people to chase after various types of prizes,
and only later, perhaps too late, to realize that some of them
weren&#39;t worth as much as they thought. If you write about that, you
can be confident of a conveyor belt of future readers to be surprised
by it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ditto if you write about the tendency of the inexperienced to overdo
things — of young engineers to produce overcomplicated solutions,
for example. There are some kinds of mistakes people never learn
to avoid except by making them. Any of those should be a timeless
topic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes when we&#39;re slow to grasp things it&#39;s not just because
we&#39;re obtuse or in denial but because we&#39;ve been deliberately lied
to. There are a lot of things adults &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/lies.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;lie&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
to kids about, and when
you reach adulthood, they don&#39;t take you aside and hand you a list
of them. They don&#39;t remember which lies they told you, and most
were implicit anyway. So contradicting such lies will be a source
of surprises for as long as adults keep telling them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes it&#39;s systems that lie to you. For example, the educational
systems in most countries train you to win by 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;hacking the test&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But
that&#39;s not how you win at the most important real-world tests, and
after decades of training, this is hard for new arrivals in the real
world to grasp. Helping them overcome such institutional lies will
work as long as the institutions remain broken. 
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/best.html#f12n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;12&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another recipe for timelessness is to write about things readers
already know, but in much more detail than can be transmitted
culturally. &quot;Everyone knows,&quot; for example, that it can be rewarding
to have &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/kids.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;kids&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But till you have them you don&#39;t know precisely what
forms that takes, and even then much of what you know you may never
have put into words.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve written about all these kinds of topics. But I didn&#39;t do it
in a deliberate attempt to write essays that were timeless in the
stricter sense. And indeed, the fact that this depends on one&#39;s ideas
not sticking suggests that it&#39;s not worth making a deliberate attempt
to. You should write about topics of timeless importance, yes, but
if you do such a good job that your conclusions stick and future
generations find your essay obvious instead of novel, so much the
better. You&#39;ve crossed into Darwin territory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Writing about topics of timeless importance is an instance of
something even more general, though: breadth of applicability. And
there are more kinds of breadth than chronological — applying to
lots of different fields, for example. So breadth is the ultimate
aim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I already aim for it. Breadth and novelty are the two things I&#39;m
always chasing. But I&#39;m glad I understand where timelessness fits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I understand better where a lot of things fit now. This essay has
been a kind of tour of essay writing. I started out hoping to get
advice about topics; if you assume good writing, the only thing
left to differentiate the best essay is its topic. And I did get
advice about topics: discover natural selection. Yeah, that would
be nice. But when you step back and ask what&#39;s the best you can do
short of making some great discovery like that, the answer turns
out to be about procedure. Ultimately the quality of an essay is a
function of the ideas discovered in it, and the way you get them
is by casting a wide net for questions and then being very exacting
with the answers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most striking feature of this map of essay writing are the
alternating stripes of inspiration and effort required. The questions
depend on inspiration, but the answers can be got by sheer persistence.
You don&#39;t have to get an answer right the first time, but there&#39;s
no excuse for not getting it right eventually, because you can keep
rewriting till you do. And this is not just a theoretical possibility.
It&#39;s a pretty accurate description of the way I work. I&#39;m rewriting
as we speak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But although I wish I could say that writing great essays depends mostly
on effort, in the limit case it&#39;s inspiration that makes the
difference. In the limit case, the questions are the harder thing
to get. That pool has no bottom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How to get more questions? That is the most important question of
all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
There might be some resistance to this conclusion on the
grounds that some of these discoveries could only be understood by
a small number of readers. But you get into all sorts of difficulties
if you want to disqualify essays on this account. How do you decide
where the cutoff should be? If a virus kills off everyone except a 
handful of people sequestered at Los Alamos,
could an essay that had been disqualified now be eligible? Etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darwin&#39;s 1844 essay was derived from an earlier version written in 1839.
Extracts from it were published in 1858.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
When you find yourself very curious about an apparently minor
question, that&#39;s an exciting sign. Evolution has designed you to
pay attention to things that matter. So when you&#39;re very curious
about something random, that could mean you&#39;ve unconsciously noticed
it&#39;s less random than it seems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Corollary: If you&#39;re not intellectually honest, your writing
won&#39;t just be biased, but also boring, because you&#39;ll miss all the
ideas you&#39;d have discovered if you pushed for the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Sometimes this process begins before you start writing.
Sometimes you&#39;ve already figured out the first few things you want
to say. Schoolchildren are often taught they should decide &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;
they want to say, and write this down as an outline before they
start writing the essay itself. Maybe that&#39;s a good way to get them
started — or not, I don&#39;t know — but it&#39;s antithetical to the
spirit of essay writing. The more detailed your outline, the less
your ideas can benefit from the sort of discovery that essays are for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The problem with this type of &quot;greedy&quot; algorithm is that you
can end up on a local maximum. If the most valuable question is
preceded by a boring one, you&#39;ll overlook it. But I can&#39;t imagine
a better strategy. There&#39;s no lookahead except by writing. So use
a greedy algorithm and a lot of time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f6n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I ended up reattaching the first 5 of the 17 paragraphs, and
discarding the rest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f7n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Stephen Fry confessed to making use of this phenomenon when
taking exams at Oxford. He had in his head a standard essay about
some general literary topic, and he would find a way to turn the
exam question toward it and then just reproduce it again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strictly speaking it&#39;s the graph of ideas that would be highly
connected, not the space, but that usage would confuse people who
don&#39;t know graph theory, whereas people who do know it will get
what I mean if I say &quot;space&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f8n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Too far doesn&#39;t depend just on the distance from the original
topic. It&#39;s more like that distance divided by the value of whatever
I&#39;ve discovered in the subtree.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f9n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Or can you? I should try writing about this. Even if the
chance of succeeding is small, the expected value is huge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f10n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;10&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
There was a vogue in the 20th century for saying that the
purpose of art was also to teach. Some artists tried to justify
their work by explaining that their goal was not to produce something
good, but to challenge our preconceptions about art. And to be fair,
art can teach somewhat. The ancient Greeks&#39; naturalistic sculptures
represented a new idea, and must have been extra exciting to
contemporaries on that account. But they still look good to us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f11n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;11&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Bertrand Russell caused huge controversy in the early 20th
century with his ideas about &quot;trial marriage.&quot; But they make boring
reading now, because they prevailed. &quot;Trial marriage&quot; is what we
call &quot;dating.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f12n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;12&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
If you&#39;d asked me 10 years ago, I&#39;d have predicted that schools
would continue to teach hacking the test for centuries. But now it
seems plausible that students will soon be taught individually by
AIs, and that exams will be replaced by ongoing, invisible
micro-assessments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;888888&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, 
Jessica Livingston, Robert
Morris, Courtenay Pipkin, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of

when I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performance
are superlinear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear.
&quot;You get out,&quot; I heard a thousand times, &quot;what you put in.&quot; They
meant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only half
as good as your competitor&#39;s, you don&#39;t get half as many customers.
You get no customers, and you go out of business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear
in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if
we changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear
returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact
of rules we&#39;ve invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power,
military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all
of these, the rich get richer.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can&#39;t understand the world without understanding the concept
of superlinear returns. And if you&#39;re ambitious you definitely
should, because this will be the wave you surf on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It may seem as if there are a lot of different situations with
superlinear returns, but as far as I can tell they reduce to two
fundamental causes: exponential growth and thresholds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you&#39;re working
on something that grows exponentially. For example, growing bacterial
cultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially. But they&#39;re
tricky to grow. Which means the difference in outcome between someone
who&#39;s adept at it and someone who&#39;s not is very great.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Startups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same pattern
there. Some manage to achieve high growth rates. Most don&#39;t. And
as a result you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companies
with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the
ones with lower growth rates may not even survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather
than absolute numbers. It prevents them from being discouraged early
on, when the absolute numbers are still low. It also helps them
decide what to focus on: you can use growth rate as a compass to
tell you how to evolve the company. But the main advantage is that
by focusing on growth rate you tend to get something that grows
exponentially.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;YC doesn&#39;t explicitly tell founders that with growth rate &quot;you get
out what you put in,&quot; but it&#39;s not far from the truth. And if growth
rate were proportional to performance, then the reward for performance
&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; over time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; would be proportional to &lt;i&gt;p&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even after decades of thinking about this, I find that sentence
startling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whenever how well you do depends on how well you&#39;ve done, you&#39;ll
get exponential growth. But neither our DNA nor our customs prepare
us for it. No one finds exponential growth natural; every child is
surprised, the first time they hear it, by the story of the man who
asks the king for a single grain of rice the first day and double
the amount each successive day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What we don&#39;t understand naturally we develop customs to deal with,
but we don&#39;t have many customs about exponential growth either,
because there have been so few instances of it in human history.
In principle herding should have been one: the more animals you
had, the more offspring they&#39;d have. But in practice grazing land
was the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing that
exponentially.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or more precisely, no generally applicable plan. There &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a way
to grow one&#39;s territory exponentially: by conquest. The more territory
you control, the more powerful your army becomes, and the easier
it is to conquer new territory. This is why history is full of
empires. But so few people created or ran empires that their
experiences didn&#39;t affect customs very much. The emperor was a
remote and terrifying figure, not a source of lessons one could use
in one&#39;s own life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times
was probably scholarship. The more you know, the easier it is to
learn new things. The result, then as now, was that some people
were startlingly more knowledgeable than the rest about certain
topics. But this didn&#39;t affect customs much either. Although empires
of ideas can overlap and there can thus be far more emperors, in
preindustrial times this type of empire had little practical effect.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That has changed in the last few centuries. Now the emperors of
ideas can design bombs that defeat the emperors of territory. But
this phenomenon is still so new that we haven&#39;t fully assimilated
it. Few even of the participants realize they&#39;re benefitting from
exponential growth or ask what they can learn from other instances
of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other source of superlinear returns is embodied in the expression
&quot;winner take all.&quot; In a sports match the relationship between
performance and return is a step function: the winning team gets
one win whether they do much better or just slightly better.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The source of the step function is not competition per se, however.
It&#39;s that there are thresholds in the outcome. You don&#39;t need
competition to get those. There can be thresholds in situations
where you&#39;re the only participant, like proving a theorem or hitting
a target.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s remarkable how often a situation with one source of superlinear
returns also has the other. Crossing thresholds leads to exponential
growth: the winning side in a battle usually suffers less damage,
which makes them more likely to win in the future. And exponential
growth helps you cross thresholds: in a market with network effects,
a company that grows fast enough can shut out potential competitors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fame is an interesting example of a phenomenon that combines both
sources of superlinear returns. Fame grows exponentially because
existing fans bring you new ones. But the fundamental reason it&#39;s
so concentrated is thresholds: there&#39;s only so much room on the
A-list in the average person&#39;s head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most important case combining both sources of superlinear returns
may be learning. Knowledge grows exponentially, but there are also
thresholds in it. Learning to ride a bicycle, for example. Some of
these thresholds are akin to machine tools: once you learn to read,
you&#39;re able to learn anything else much faster. But the most important
thresholds of all are those representing new discoveries. Knowledge
seems to be fractal in the sense that if you push hard at the
boundary of one area of knowledge, you sometimes discover a whole
new field. And if you do, you get first crack at all the new
discoveries to be made in it. Newton did this, and so did Durer and
Darwin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Are there general rules for finding situations with superlinear
returns? The most obvious one is to seek work that compounds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are two ways work can compound. It can compound directly, in
the sense that doing well in one cycle causes you to do better in
the next. That happens for example when you&#39;re building infrastructure,
or growing an audience or brand. Or work can compound by teaching
you, since learning compounds. This second case is an interesting
one because you may feel you&#39;re doing badly as it&#39;s happening. You
may be failing to achieve your immediate goal. But if you&#39;re learning
a lot, then you&#39;re getting exponential growth nonetheless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is one reason Silicon Valley is so tolerant of failure. People
in Silicon Valley aren&#39;t blindly tolerant of failure. They&#39;ll only
continue to bet on you if you&#39;re learning from your failures. But
if you are, you are in fact a good bet: maybe your company didn&#39;t
grow the way you wanted, but you yourself have, and that should
yield results eventually.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, the forms of exponential growth that don&#39;t consist of
learning are so often intermixed with it that we should probably
treat this as the rule rather than the exception. Which yields
another heuristic: always be learning. If you&#39;re not learning,
you&#39;re probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But don&#39;t overoptimize &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; you&#39;re learning. Don&#39;t limit yourself
to learning things that are already known to be valuable. You&#39;re
learning; you don&#39;t know for sure yet what&#39;s going to be valuable,
and if you&#39;re too strict you&#39;ll lop off the outliers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What about step functions? Are there also useful heuristics of the
form &quot;seek thresholds&quot; or &quot;seek competition?&quot; Here the situation
is trickier. The existence of a threshold doesn&#39;t guarantee the
game will be worth playing. If you play a round of Russian roulette,
you&#39;ll be in a situation with a threshold, certainly, but in the
best case you&#39;re no better off. &quot;Seek competition&quot; is similarly
useless; what if the prize isn&#39;t worth competing for? Sufficiently
fast exponential growth guarantees both the shape and magnitude of
the return curve — because something that grows fast enough will
grow big even if it&#39;s trivially small at first — but thresholds
only guarantee the shape.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A principle for taking advantage of thresholds has to include a
test to ensure the game is worth playing. Here&#39;s one that does: if
you come across something that&#39;s mediocre yet still popular, it
could be a good idea to replace it. For example, if a company makes
a product that people dislike yet still buy, then presumably they&#39;d
buy a better alternative if you made one.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would be great if there were a way to find promising intellectual
thresholds. Is there a way to tell which questions have whole new
fields beyond them? I doubt we could ever predict this with certainty,
but the prize is so valuable that it would be useful to have
predictors that were even a little better than random, and there&#39;s
hope of finding those. We can to some degree predict when a research
problem &lt;i&gt;isn&#39;t&lt;/i&gt; likely to lead to new discoveries: when it seems
legit but boring. Whereas the kind that do lead to new discoveries
tend to seem very mystifying, but perhaps unimportant. (If they
were mystifying and obviously important, they&#39;d be famous open
questions with lots of people already working on them.) So one
heuristic here is to be driven by curiosity rather than careerism
— to give free rein to your curiosity instead of working on what
you&#39;re supposed to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The prospect of superlinear returns for performance is an exciting
one for the ambitious. And there&#39;s good news in this department:
this territory is expanding in both directions. There are more types
of work in which you can get superlinear returns, and the returns
themselves are growing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are two reasons for this, though they&#39;re so closely intertwined
that they&#39;re more like one and a half: progress in technology, and
the decreasing importance of organizations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fifty years ago it used to be much more necessary to be part of an
organization to work on ambitious projects. It was the only way to
get the resources you needed, the only way to have colleagues, and
the only way to get distribution. So in 1970 your prestige was in
most cases the prestige of the organization you belonged to. And
prestige was an accurate predictor, because if you weren&#39;t part of
an organization, you weren&#39;t likely to achieve much. There were a
handful of exceptions, most notably artists and writers, who worked
alone using inexpensive tools and had their own brands. But even
they were at the mercy of organizations for reaching audiences.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f6n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A world dominated by organizations damped variation in the returns
for performance. But this world has eroded significantly just in
my lifetime. Now a lot more people can have the freedom that artists
and writers had in the 20th century. There are lots of ambitious
projects that don&#39;t require much initial funding, and lots of new
ways to learn, make money, find colleagues, and reach audiences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s still plenty of the old world left, but the rate of change
has been dramatic by historical standards. Especially considering
what&#39;s at stake. It&#39;s hard to imagine a more fundamental change
than one in the returns for performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without the damping effect of institutions, there will be more
variation in outcomes. Which doesn&#39;t imply everyone will be better
off: people who do well will do even better, but those who do badly
will do worse. That&#39;s an important point to bear in mind. Exposing
oneself to superlinear returns is not for everyone. Most people
will be better off as part of the pool. So who should shoot for
superlinear returns? Ambitious people of two types: those who know
they&#39;re so good that they&#39;ll be net ahead in a world with higher
variation, and those, particularly the young, who can afford to
risk trying it to find out.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f7n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The switch away from institutions won&#39;t simply be an exodus of their
current inhabitants. Many of the new winners will be people they&#39;d
never have let in. So the resulting democratization of opportunity
will be both greater and more authentic than any tame intramural
version the institutions themselves might have cooked up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Not everyone is happy about this great unlocking of ambition. It
threatens some vested interests and contradicts some ideologies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f8n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
But if you&#39;re an ambitious individual it&#39;s good news for you.
How should you take advantage of it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most obvious way to take advantage of superlinear returns for
performance is by doing exceptionally good work. At the far end of
the curve, incremental effort is a bargain. All the more so because
there&#39;s less competition at the far end — and not just for the
obvious reason that it&#39;s hard to do something exceptionally well,
but also because people find the prospect so intimidating that few
even try. Which means it&#39;s not just a bargain to do exceptional
work, but a bargain even to try to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are many variables that affect how good your work is, and if
you want to be an outlier you need to get nearly all of them right.
For example, to do something exceptionally well, you have to be
interested in it. Mere diligence is not enough. So in a world with
superlinear returns, it&#39;s even more valuable to know what you&#39;re
interested in, and to find ways to work on it.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f9n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
It will also be
important to choose work that suits your circumstances. For example,
if there&#39;s a kind of work that inherently requires a huge expenditure
of time and energy, it will be increasingly valuable to do it when
you&#39;re young and don&#39;t yet have children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s a surprising amount of technique to doing great work.
It&#39;s not just a matter of trying hard. I&#39;m going to take a shot
giving a recipe in one paragraph.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Choose work you have a natural aptitude for and a deep interest in.
Develop a habit of working on your own projects; it doesn&#39;t matter
what they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious. Work
as hard as you can without burning out, and this will eventually
bring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. These look smooth
from a distance, but up close they&#39;re full of gaps. Notice and
explore such gaps, and if you&#39;re lucky one will expand into a whole
new field. Take as much risk as you can afford; if you&#39;re not failing
occasionally you&#39;re probably being too conservative. Seek out the
best colleagues. Develop good taste and learn from the best examples.
Be honest, especially with yourself. Exercise and eat and sleep
well and avoid the more dangerous drugs. When in doubt, follow your
curiosity. It never lies, and it knows more than you do about what&#39;s
worth paying attention to.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f10n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;10&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And there is of course one other thing you need: to be lucky. Luck
is always a factor, but it&#39;s even more of a factor when you&#39;re
working on your own rather than as part of an organization. And
though there are some valid aphorisms about luck being where
preparedness meets opportunity and so on, there&#39;s also a component
of true chance that you can&#39;t do anything about. The solution is
to take multiple shots. Which is another reason to start taking
risks early.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The best example of a field with superlinear returns is probably
science. It has exponential growth, in the form of learning, combined
with thresholds at the extreme edge of performance — literally at
the limits of knowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The result has been a level of inequality in scientific discovery
that makes the wealth inequality of even the most stratified societies
seem mild by comparison. Newton&#39;s discoveries were arguably greater
than all his contemporaries&#39; combined.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f11n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;11&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This point may seem obvious, but it might be just as well to spell
it out. Superlinear returns imply inequality. The steeper the return
curve, the greater the variation in outcomes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact, the correlation between superlinear returns and inequality
is so strong that it yields another heuristic for finding work of
this type: look for fields where a few big winners outperform
everyone else. A kind of work where everyone does about the same
is unlikely to be one with superlinear returns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What are fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else?
Here are some obvious ones: sports, politics, art, music, acting,
directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing.
In sports the phenomenon is due to externally imposed thresholds;
you only need to be a few percent faster to win every race. In
politics, power grows much as it did in the days of emperors. And
in some of the other fields (including politics) success is driven
largely by fame, which has its own source of superlinear growth.
But when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, a
remarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the same
as the list of fields where you have to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/think.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;independent-minded&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to
succeed — where your ideas have to be not just correct, but novel
as well.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html#f12n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;12&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is obviously the case in science. You can&#39;t publish papers
saying things that other people have already said. But it&#39;s just
as true in investing, for example. It&#39;s only useful to believe that
a company will do well if most other investors don&#39;t; if everyone
else thinks the company will do well, then its stock price will
already reflect that, and there&#39;s no room to make money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What else can we learn from these fields? In all of them you have
to put in the initial effort. Superlinear returns seem small at
first. &lt;i&gt;At this rate,&lt;/i&gt; you find yourself thinking, &lt;i&gt;I&#39;ll never get
anywhere.&lt;/i&gt; But because the reward curve rises so steeply at the far
end, it&#39;s worth taking extraordinary measures to get there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the startup world, the name for this principle is &quot;do things
that don&#39;t scale.&quot; If you pay a ridiculous amount of attention to
your tiny initial set of customers, ideally you&#39;ll kick off exponential
growth by word of mouth. But this same principle applies to anything
that grows exponentially. Learning, for example. When you first
start learning something, you feel lost. But it&#39;s worth making the
initial effort to get a toehold, because the more you learn, the
easier it will get.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s another more subtle lesson in the list of fields with
superlinear returns: not to equate work with a job. For most of the
20th century the two were identical for nearly everyone, and as a
result we&#39;ve inherited a custom that equates productivity with
having a job. Even now to most people the phrase &quot;your work&quot; means
their job. But to a writer or artist or scientist it means whatever
they&#39;re currently studying or creating. For someone like that, their
work is something they carry with them from job to job, if they
have jobs at all. It may be done for an employer, but it&#39;s part of
their portfolio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It&#39;s an intimidating prospect to enter a field where a few big
winners outperform everyone else. Some people do this deliberately,
but you don&#39;t need to. If you have sufficient natural ability and
you follow your curiosity sufficiently far, you&#39;ll end up in one.
Your curiosity won&#39;t let you be interested in boring questions, and
interesting questions tend to create fields with superlinear returns
if they&#39;re not already part of one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The territory of superlinear returns is by no means static. Indeed,
the most extreme returns come from expanding it. So while both
ambition and curiosity can get you into this territory, curiosity
may be the more powerful of the two. Ambition tends to make you
climb existing peaks, but if you stick close enough to an interesting
enough question, it may grow into a mountain beneath you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s a limit to how sharply you can distinguish between effort,
performance, and return, because they&#39;re not sharply distinguished
in fact. What counts as return to one person might be performance
to another. But though the borders of these concepts are blurry,
they&#39;re not meaningless. I&#39;ve tried to write about them as precisely
as I could without crossing into error.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Evolution itself is probably the most pervasive example of
superlinear returns for performance. But this is hard for us to
empathize with because we&#39;re not the recipients; we&#39;re the returns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Knowledge did of course have a practical effect before the
Industrial Revolution. The development of agriculture changed human
life completely. But this kind of change was the result of broad,
gradual improvements in technique, not the discoveries of a few
exceptionally learned people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
It&#39;s not mathematically correct to describe a step function as
superlinear, but a step function starting from zero works like a
superlinear function when it describes the reward curve for effort
by a rational actor. If it starts at zero then the part before the
step is below any linearly increasing return, and the part after
the step must be above the necessary return at that point or no one
would bother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Seeking competition could be a good heuristic in the sense that
some people find it motivating. It&#39;s also somewhat of a guide to
promising problems, because it&#39;s a sign that other people find them
promising. But it&#39;s a very imperfect sign: often there&#39;s a clamoring
crowd chasing some problem, and they all end up being trumped by
someone quietly working on another one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Not always, though. You have to be careful with this rule. When
something is popular despite being mediocre, there&#39;s often a hidden
reason why. Perhaps monopoly or regulation make it hard to compete.
Perhaps customers have bad taste or have broken procedures for
deciding what to buy. There are huge swathes of mediocre things
that exist for such reasons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f6n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
In my twenties I wanted to be an &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/worked.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;artist&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
and even went to art
school to study painting. Mostly because I liked art, but a nontrivial
part of my motivation came from the fact that artists seemed least
at the mercy of organizations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f7n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
In principle everyone is getting superlinear returns. Learning
compounds, and everyone learns in the course of their life. But in
practice few push this kind of everyday learning to the point where
the return curve gets really steep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f8n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
It&#39;s unclear exactly what advocates of &quot;equity&quot; mean by it.
They seem to disagree among themselves. But whatever they mean is
probably at odds with a world in which institutions have less power
to control outcomes, and a handful of outliers do much better than
everyone else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It may seem like bad luck for this concept that it arose at just
the moment when the world was shifting in the opposite direction,
but I don&#39;t think this was a coincidence. I think one reason it
arose now is because its adherents feel threatened by rapidly
increasing variation in performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f9n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Corollary: Parents who pressure their kids to work on something
prestigious, like medicine, even though they have no interest in
it, will be hosing them even more than they have in the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f10n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;10&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The original version of this paragraph was the first draft of
&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;How to Do Great Work&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; 
As soon as I wrote it I realized it was a more important topic than superlinear
returns, so I paused the present essay to expand this paragraph into its
own. Practically nothing remains of the original version, because
after I finished &quot;How to Do Great Work&quot; I rewrote it based on that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f11n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;11&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Before the Industrial Revolution, people who got rich usually
did it like emperors: capturing some resource made them more powerful
and enabled them to capture more. Now it can be done like a scientist,
by discovering or building something uniquely valuable. Most people
who get rich use a mix of the old and the new ways, but in the most
advanced economies the ratio has &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/richnow.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;shifted dramatically&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; toward discovery
just in the last half century.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f12n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;12&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
It&#39;s not surprising that conventional-minded people would
dislike inequality if independent-mindedness is one of the biggest
drivers of it. But it&#39;s not simply that they don&#39;t want anyone to
have what they can&#39;t. The conventional-minded literally can&#39;t imagine
what it&#39;s like to have novel ideas. So the whole phenomenon of great
variation in performance seems unnatural to them, and when they
encounter it they assume it must be due to cheating or to some
malign external influence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;888888&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt;

of different fields, what would the intersection look like? I decided
to find out by making it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Partly my goal was to create a guide that could be used by someone
working in any field. But I was also curious about the shape of the
intersection. And one thing this exercise shows is that it does
have a definite shape; it&#39;s not just a point labelled &quot;work hard.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The following recipe assumes you&#39;re very ambitious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose
needs to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a
natural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that
offers scope to do great work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In practice you don&#39;t have to worry much about the third criterion.
Ambitious people are if anything already too conservative about it.
So all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for
and great interest in.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That sounds straightforward, but it&#39;s often quite difficult. When
you&#39;re young you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re good at or what different
kinds of work are like. Some kinds of work you end up doing may not
even exist yet. So while some people know what they want to do at
14, most have to figure it out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you&#39;re not
sure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going.
You&#39;ll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that&#39;s fine. It&#39;s
good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries
come from noticing connections between different fields.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don&#39;t let &quot;work&quot;
mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do
great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own.
It may be within some bigger project, but you&#39;ll be driving your
part of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly
ambitious. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves,
exciting and important will converge. At 7 it may seem excitingly
ambitious to build huge things out of Lego, then at 14 to teach
yourself calculus, till at 21 you&#39;re starting to explore unanswered
questions in physics. But always preserve excitingness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s a kind of excited curiosity that&#39;s both the engine and the
rudder of great work. It will not only drive you, but if you let
it have its way, will also show you what to work on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What are you excessively curious about — curious to a degree that
would bore most other people? That&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once you&#39;ve found something you&#39;re excessively interested in, the
next step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the
frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge expands fractally, and from a
distance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get
close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next step is to notice them. This takes some skill, because
your brain wants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simpler
model of the world. Many discoveries have come from asking questions
about things that everyone else took for granted. 
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the answers seem strange, so much the better. Great work often
has a tincture of strangeness. You see this from painting to math.
It would be affected to try to manufacture it, but if it appears,
embrace it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boldly chase outlier ideas, even if other people aren&#39;t interested
in them — in fact, especially if they aren&#39;t. If you&#39;re excited
about some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you have
enough expertise to say precisely what they&#39;re all overlooking,
that&#39;s as good a bet as you&#39;ll find.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier,
notice gaps, explore promising ones. This is how practically everyone
who&#39;s done great work has done it, from painters to physicists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Steps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible
to prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but the
empirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality.
That&#39;s why it&#39;s essential to work on something you&#39;re deeply
interested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere
diligence ever could.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the
desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and
that combination is the most powerful of all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The big prize is to discover a new fractal bud. You notice a crack
in the surface of knowledge, pry it open, and there&#39;s a whole world
inside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let&#39;s talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring
out what to work on. The main reason it&#39;s hard is that you can&#39;t
tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. Which
means the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something for
years before you know how much you like it or how good you are at
it. And in the meantime you&#39;re not doing, and thus not learning
about, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you choose
late based on very incomplete information.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes in
two forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that
grows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the
more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what
to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The educational systems in most countries pretend it&#39;s easy. They
expect you to commit to a field long before you could know what
it&#39;s really like. And as a result an ambitious person on an optimal
trajectory will often read to the system as an instance of breakage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would be better if they at least admitted it — if they admitted
that the system not only can&#39;t do much to help you figure out what
to work on, but is designed on the assumption that you&#39;ll somehow
magically guess as a teenager. They don&#39;t tell you, but I will:
when it comes to figuring out what to work on, you&#39;re on your own.
Some people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest will
find themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on
the assumption that everyone does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What should you do if you&#39;re young and ambitious but don&#39;t know
what to work on? What you should &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; do is drift along passively,
assuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action.
But there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read
biographies of people who&#39;ve done great work, it&#39;s remarkable how
much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result
of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up.
So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to
do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people,
read lots of books, ask lots of questions.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you
learn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very
different from what you do in high school math classes. So you need
to give different types of work a chance to show you what they&#39;re
like. But a field should become &lt;i&gt;increasingly&lt;/i&gt; interesting as you
learn more about it. If it doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s probably not for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t worry if you find you&#39;re interested in different things than
other people. The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the
better. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste
for work means you&#39;ll be productive. And you&#39;re more likely to find
new things if you&#39;re looking where few have looked before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One sign that you&#39;re suited for some kind of work is when you like
even the parts that other people find tedious or frightening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But fields aren&#39;t people; you don&#39;t owe them any loyalty. If in the
course of working on one thing you discover another that&#39;s more
exciting, don&#39;t be afraid to switch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&#39;re making something for people, make sure it&#39;s something
they actually want. The best way to do this is to make something
you yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the tool
you want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests,
this will also get you your initial audience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; follow from the excitingness rule. Obviously the most
exciting story to write will be the one you want to read. The reason
I mention this case explicitly is that so many people get it wrong.
Instead of making what they want, they try to make what some
imaginary, more sophisticated audience wants. And once you go down
that route, you&#39;re lost.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f6n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you&#39;re
trying to figure out what to work on. Pretentiousness, fashion,
fear, money, politics, other people&#39;s wishes, eminent frauds. But
if you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you&#39;ll be proof
against all of them. If you&#39;re interested, you&#39;re not astray.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Following your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy,
but in practice it usually means following them past all sorts of
obstacles. You usually have to risk rejection and failure. So it
does take a good deal of boldness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But while you need boldness, you don&#39;t usually need much planning.
In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard
on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of
it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try
to preserve certain invariants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements
you can describe in advance. You can win a gold medal or get rich
by deciding to as a child and then tenaciously pursuing that goal,
but you can&#39;t discover natural selection that way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy
is not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most
interesting and gives you the best options for the future. I call
this approach &quot;staying upwind.&quot; This is how most people who&#39;ve done
great work seem to have done it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Even when you&#39;ve found something exciting to work on, working on
it is not always straightforward. There will be times when some new
idea makes you leap out of bed in the morning and get straight to
work. But there will also be plenty of times when things aren&#39;t
like that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You don&#39;t just put out your sail and get blown forward by inspiration.
There are headwinds and currents and hidden shoals. So there&#39;s a
technique to working, just as there is to sailing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, while you must work hard, it&#39;s possible to work too
hard, and if you do that you&#39;ll find you get diminishing returns:
fatigue will make you stupid, and eventually even damage your health.
The point at which work yields diminishing returns depends on the
type. Some of the hardest types you might only be able to do for
four or five hours a day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ideally those hours will be contiguous. To the extent you can, try
to arrange your life so you have big blocks of time to work in.
You&#39;ll shy away from hard tasks if you know you might be interrupted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working.
You&#39;ll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial
threshold. Don&#39;t worry about this; it&#39;s the nature of work, not a
flaw in your character. Work has a sort of activation energy, both
per day and per project. And since this threshold is fake in the
sense that it&#39;s higher than the energy required to keep going, it&#39;s
ok to tell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over
it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s usually a mistake to lie to yourself if you want to do great
work, but this is one of the rare cases where it isn&#39;t. When I&#39;m
reluctant to start work in the morning, I often trick myself by
saying &quot;I&#39;ll just read over what I&#39;ve got so far.&quot; Five minutes
later I&#39;ve found something that seems mistaken or incomplete, and
I&#39;m off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similar techniques work for starting new projects. It&#39;s ok to lie
to yourself about how much work a project will entail, for example.
Lots of great things began with someone saying &quot;How hard could it
be?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is one case where the young have an advantage. They&#39;re more
optimistic, and even though one of the sources of their optimism
is ignorance, in this case ignorance can sometimes beat knowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be
more work than you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercise
in tidiness or self-discipline. In many projects a lot of the best
work happens in what was meant to be the final stage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another permissible lie is to exaggerate the importance of what
you&#39;re working on, at least in your own mind. If that helps you
discover something new, it may turn out not to have been a lie after
all.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f7n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Since there are two senses of starting work — per day and per
project — there are also two forms of procrastination. Per-project
procrastination is far the more dangerous. You put off starting
that ambitious project from year to year because the time isn&#39;t
quite right. When you&#39;re procrastinating in units of years, you can
get a lot not done.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f8n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it
usually camouflages itself as work. You&#39;re not just sitting around
doing nothing; you&#39;re working industriously on something else. So
per-project procrastination doesn&#39;t set off the alarms that per-day
procrastination does. You&#39;re too busy to notice it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I
working on what I most want to work on? When you&#39;re young it&#39;s ok
if the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous
as you get older.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f9n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people
an unreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can&#39;t think of
this time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find the
work sufficiently engaging as it&#39;s happening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years
at things you hate before you get to the good part, but this is not
how great work happens. Great work happens by focusing consistently
on something you&#39;re genuinely interested in. When you pause to take
stock, you&#39;re surprised how far you&#39;ve come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason we&#39;re surprised is that we underestimate the cumulative
effect of work. Writing a page a day doesn&#39;t sound like much, but
if you do it every day you&#39;ll write a book a year. That&#39;s the key:
consistency. People who do great things don&#39;t get a lot done every
day. They get something done, rather than nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you do work that compounds, you&#39;ll get exponential growth. Most
people who do this do it unconsciously, but it&#39;s worth stopping to
think about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon:
the more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more.
Growing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the more
new fans they&#39;ll bring you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat
in the beginning. It isn&#39;t; it&#39;s still a wonderful exponential
curve. But we can&#39;t grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential
growth in its early stages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it&#39;s
worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. But since
we underrate exponential growth early on, this too is mostly done
unconsciously: people push through the initial, unrewarding phase
of learning something new because they know from experience that
learning new things always takes an initial push, or they grow their
audience one fan at a time because they have nothing better to do.
If people consciously realized they could invest in exponential
growth, many more would do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Work doesn&#39;t just happen when you&#39;re trying to. There&#39;s a kind of
undirected thinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lying
in bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind wander a
little, you&#39;ll often solve problems you were unable to solve by
frontal attack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have to be working hard in the normal way to benefit from this
phenomenon, though. You can&#39;t just walk around daydreaming. The
daydreaming has to be interleaved with deliberate work that feeds
it questions.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f10n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;10&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone knows to avoid distractions at work, but it&#39;s also important
to avoid them in the other half of the cycle. When you let your
mind wander, it wanders to whatever you care about most at that
moment. So avoid the kind of distraction that pushes your work out
of the top spot, or you&#39;ll waste this valuable type of thinking on
the distraction instead. (Exception: Don&#39;t avoid love.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Consciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field.
Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don&#39;t
know what you&#39;re aiming for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; what you&#39;re aiming for, because if you don&#39;t try to
be the best, you won&#39;t even be good. This observation has been made
by so many people in so many different fields that it might be worth
thinking about why it&#39;s true. It could be because ambition is a
phenomenon where almost all the error is in one direction — where
almost all the shells that miss the target miss by falling short.
Or it could be because ambition to be the best is a qualitatively
different thing from ambition to be good. Or maybe being good is
simply too vague a standard. Probably all three are true.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f11n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;11&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunately there&#39;s a kind of economy of scale here. Though it might
seem like you&#39;d be taking on a heavy burden by trying to be the
best, in practice you often end up net ahead. It&#39;s exciting, and
also strangely liberating. It simplifies things. In some ways it&#39;s
easier to try to be the best than to try merely to be good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One way to aim high is to try to make something that people will
care about in a hundred years. Not because their opinions matter
more than your contemporaries&#39;, but because something that still
seems good in a hundred years is more likely to be genuinely good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don&#39;t try to work in a distinctive style. Just try to do the best
job you can; you won&#39;t be able to help doing it in a distinctive
way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Style is doing things in a distinctive way without trying to. Trying
to is affectation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Affectation is in effect to pretend that someone other than you is
doing the work. You adopt an impressive but fake persona, and while
you&#39;re pleased with the impressiveness, the fakeness is what shows
in the work.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f12n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;12&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The temptation to be someone else is greatest for the young. They
often feel like nobodies. But you never need to worry about that
problem, because it&#39;s self-solving if you work on sufficiently
ambitious projects. If you succeed at an ambitious project, you&#39;re
not a nobody; you&#39;re the person who did it. So just do the work and
your identity will take care of itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Avoid affectation&quot; is a useful rule so far as it goes, but how
would you express this idea positively? How would you say what to
be, instead of what not to be? The best answer is earnest. If you&#39;re
earnest you avoid not just affectation but a whole set of similar
vices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The core of being earnest is being intellectually honest. We&#39;re
taught as children to be honest as an unselfish virtue — as a kind
of sacrifice. But in fact it&#39;s a source of power too. To see new
ideas, you need an exceptionally sharp eye for the truth. You&#39;re
trying to see more truth than others have seen so far. And how can
you have a sharp eye for the truth if you&#39;re intellectually dishonest?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One way to avoid intellectual dishonesty is to maintain a slight
positive pressure in the opposite direction. Be aggressively willing
to admit that you&#39;re mistaken. Once you&#39;ve admitted you were mistaken
about something, you&#39;re free. Till then you have to carry it.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f13n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;13&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another more subtle component of earnestness is informality.
Informality is much more important than its grammatically negative
name implies. It&#39;s not merely the absence of something. It means
focusing on what matters instead of what doesn&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What formality and affectation have in common is that as well as
doing the work, you&#39;re trying to seem a certain way as you&#39;re doing
it. But any energy that goes into how you seem comes out of being
good. That&#39;s one reason nerds have an advantage in doing great work:
they expend little effort on seeming anything. In fact that&#39;s
basically the definition of a nerd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness that&#39;s exactly what you need
in doing great work. It&#39;s not learned; it&#39;s preserved from childhood.
So hold onto it. Be the one who puts things out there rather than
the one who sits back and offers sophisticated-sounding criticisms
of them. &quot;It&#39;s easy to criticize&quot; is true in the most literal sense,
and the route to great work is never easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There may be some jobs where it&#39;s an advantage to be cynical and
pessimistic, but if you want to do great work it&#39;s an advantage to
be optimistic, even though that means you&#39;ll risk looking like a
fool sometimes. There&#39;s an old tradition of doing the opposite. The
Old Testament says it&#39;s better to keep quiet lest you look like a
fool. But that&#39;s advice for &lt;i&gt;seeming&lt;/i&gt; smart. If you actually want
to discover new things, it&#39;s better to take the risk of telling
people your ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some people are naturally earnest, and with others it takes a
conscious effort. Either kind of earnestness will suffice. But I
doubt it would be possible to do great work without being earnest.
It&#39;s so hard to do even if you are. You don&#39;t have enough margin
for error to accommodate the distortions introduced by being affected,
intellectually dishonest, orthodox, fashionable, or cool.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f14n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;14&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Great work is consistent not only with who did it, but with itself.
It&#39;s usually all of a piece. So if you face a decision in the middle
of working on something, ask which choice is more consistent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You may have to throw things away and redo them. You won&#39;t necessarily
have to, but you have to be willing to. And that can take some
effort; when there&#39;s something you need to redo, status quo bias
and laziness will combine to keep you in denial about it. To beat
this ask: If I&#39;d already made the change, would I want to revert
to what I have now?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have the confidence to cut. Don&#39;t keep something that doesn&#39;t fit
just because you&#39;re proud of it, or because it cost you a lot of
effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, in some kinds of work it&#39;s good to strip whatever you&#39;re
doing to its essence. The result will be more concentrated; you&#39;ll
understand it better; and you won&#39;t be able to lie to yourself about
whether there&#39;s anything real there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mathematical elegance may sound like a mere metaphor, drawn from
the arts. That&#39;s what I thought when I first heard the term &quot;elegant&quot;
applied to a proof. But now I suspect it&#39;s conceptually prior — 
that the main ingredient in artistic elegance is mathematical
elegance. At any rate it&#39;s a useful standard well beyond math.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elegance can be a long-term bet, though. Laborious solutions will
often have more prestige in the short term. They cost a lot of
effort and they&#39;re hard to understand, both of which impress people,
at least temporarily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whereas some of the very best work will seem like it took comparatively
little effort, because it was in a sense already there. It didn&#39;t
have to be built, just seen. It&#39;s a very good sign when it&#39;s hard
to say whether you&#39;re creating something or discovering it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you&#39;re doing work that could be seen as either creation or
discovery, err on the side of discovery. Try thinking of yourself
as a mere conduit through which the ideas take their natural shape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Strangely enough, one exception is the problem of choosing a problem
to work on. This is usually seen as search, but in the best case
it&#39;s more like creating something. In the best case you create the
field in the process of exploring it.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, if you&#39;re trying to build a powerful tool, make it
gratuitously unrestrictive. A powerful tool almost by definition
will be used in ways you didn&#39;t expect, so err on the side of
eliminating restrictions, even if you don&#39;t know what the benefit
will be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Great work will often be tool-like in the sense of being something
others build on. So it&#39;s a good sign if you&#39;re creating ideas that
others could use, or exposing questions that others could answer.
The best ideas have implications in many different areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you express your ideas in the most general form, they&#39;ll be truer
than you intended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
True by itself is not enough, of course. Great ideas have to be
true and new. And it takes a certain amount of ability to see new
ideas even once you&#39;ve learned enough to get to one of the frontiers
of knowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In English we give this ability names like originality, creativity,
and imagination. And it seems reasonable to give it a separate name,
because it does seem to some extent a separate skill. It&#39;s possible
to have a great deal of ability in other respects — to have a great
deal of what&#39;s often called &lt;i&gt;technical&lt;/i&gt; ability — and yet not have
much of this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve never liked the term &quot;creative process.&quot; It seems misleading.
Originality isn&#39;t a process, but a habit of mind. Original thinkers
throw off new ideas about whatever they focus on, like an angle
grinder throwing off sparks. They can&#39;t help it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the thing they&#39;re focused on is something they don&#39;t understand
very well, these new ideas might not be good. One of the most
original thinkers I know decided to focus on dating after he got
divorced. He knew roughly as much about dating as the average 15
year old, and the results were spectacularly colorful. But to see
originality separated from expertise like that made its nature all
the more clear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible to cultivate originality, but there
are definitely ways to make the most of however much you have. For
example, you&#39;re much more likely to have original ideas when you&#39;re
working on something. Original ideas don&#39;t come from trying to have
original ideas. They come from trying to build or understand something
slightly too difficult.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f15n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;15&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking or writing about the things you&#39;re interested in is a good
way to generate new ideas. When you try to put ideas into words, a
missing idea creates a sort of vacuum that draws it out of you.
Indeed, there&#39;s a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Changing your context can help. If you visit a new place, you&#39;ll
often find you have new ideas there. The journey itself often
dislodges them. But you may not have to go far to get this benefit.
Sometimes it&#39;s enough just to go for a walk.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f16n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;16&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It also helps to travel in topic space. You&#39;ll have more new ideas
if you explore lots of different topics, partly because it gives
the angle grinder more surface area to work on, and partly because
analogies are an especially fruitful source of new ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t divide your attention &lt;i&gt;evenly&lt;/i&gt; between many topics though,
or you&#39;ll spread yourself too thin. You want to distribute it
according to something more like a power law.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f17n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;17&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
Be professionally
curious about a few topics and idly curious about many more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Curiosity and originality are closely related. Curiosity feeds
originality by giving it new things to work on. But the relationship
is closer than that. Curiosity is itself a kind of originality;
it&#39;s roughly to questions what originality is to answers. And since
questions at their best are a big component of answers, curiosity
at its best is a creative force.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Having new ideas is a strange game, because it usually consists of
seeing things that were right under your nose. Once you&#39;ve seen a
new idea, it tends to seem obvious. Why did no one think of this
before?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When an idea seems simultaneously novel and obvious, it&#39;s probably
a good one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seeing something obvious sounds easy. And yet empirically having
new ideas is hard. What&#39;s the source of this apparent contradiction?
It&#39;s that seeing the new idea usually requires you to change the
way you look at the world. We see the world through models that
both help and constrain us. When you fix a broken model, new ideas
become obvious. But noticing and fixing a broken model is hard.
That&#39;s how new ideas can be both obvious and yet hard to discover:
they&#39;re easy to see after you do something hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One way to discover broken models is to be stricter than other
people. Broken models of the world leave a trail of clues where
they bash against reality. Most people don&#39;t want to see these
clues. It would be an understatement to say that they&#39;re attached
to their current model; it&#39;s what they think in; so they&#39;ll tend
to ignore the trail of clues left by its breakage, however conspicuous
it may seem in retrospect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To find new ideas you have to seize on signs of breakage instead
of looking away. That&#39;s what Einstein did. He was able to see the
wild implications of Maxwell&#39;s equations not so much because he was
looking for new ideas as because he was stricter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other thing you need is a willingness to break rules. Paradoxical
as it sounds, if you want to fix your model of the world, it helps
to be the sort of person who&#39;s comfortable breaking rules. From the
point of view of the old model, which everyone including you initially
shares, the new model usually breaks at least implicit rules.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Few understand the degree of rule-breaking required, because new
ideas seem much more conservative once they succeed. They seem
perfectly reasonable once you&#39;re using the new model of the world
they brought with them. But they didn&#39;t at the time; it took the
greater part of a century for the heliocentric model to be generally
accepted, even among astronomers, because it felt so wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, if you think about it, a good new idea has to seem bad to
most people, or someone would have already explored it. So what
you&#39;re looking for is ideas that seem crazy, but the right kind of
crazy. How do you recognize these? You can&#39;t with certainty. Often
ideas that seem bad are bad. But ideas that are the right kind of
crazy tend to be exciting; they&#39;re rich in implications; whereas
ideas that are merely bad tend to be depressing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are two ways to be comfortable breaking rules: to enjoy
breaking them, and to be indifferent to them. I call these two cases
being aggressively and passively independent-minded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The aggressively independent-minded are the naughty ones. Rules
don&#39;t merely fail to stop them; breaking rules gives them additional
energy. For this sort of person, delight at the sheer audacity of
a project sometimes supplies enough activation energy to get it
started.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other way to break rules is not to care about them, or perhaps
even to know they exist. This is why novices and outsiders often
make new discoveries; their ignorance of a field&#39;s assumptions acts
as a source of temporary passive independent-mindedness. Aspies
also seem to have a kind of immunity to conventional beliefs.
Several I know say that this helps them to have new ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strictness plus rule-breaking sounds like a strange combination.
In popular culture they&#39;re opposed. But popular culture has a broken
model in this respect. It implicitly assumes that issues are trivial
ones, and in trivial matters strictness and rule-breaking &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt;
opposed. But in questions that really matter, only rule-breakers
can be truly strict.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An overlooked idea often doesn&#39;t lose till the semifinals. You do
see it, subconsciously, but then another part of your subconscious
shoots it down because it would be too weird, too risky, too much
work, too controversial. This suggests an exciting possibility: if
you could turn off such filters, you could see more new ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One way to do that is to ask what would be good ideas for &lt;i&gt;someone
else&lt;/i&gt; to explore. Then your subconscious won&#39;t shoot them down to
protect you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You could also discover overlooked ideas by working in the other
direction: by starting from what&#39;s obscuring them. Every cherished
but mistaken principle is surrounded by a dead zone of valuable
ideas that are unexplored because they contradict it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Religions are collections of cherished but mistaken principles. So
anything that can be described either literally or metaphorically
as a religion will have valuable unexplored ideas in its shadow.
Copernicus and Darwin both made discoveries of this type.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f18n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;18&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What are people in your field religious about, in the sense of being
too attached to some principle that might not be as self-evident
as they think? What becomes possible if you discard it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
People show much more originality in solving problems than in
deciding which problems to solve. Even the smartest can be surprisingly
conservative when deciding what to work on. People who&#39;d never dream
of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on
fashionable problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One reason people are more conservative when choosing problems than
solutions is that problems are bigger bets. A problem could occupy
you for years, while exploring a solution might only take days. But
even so I think most people are too conservative. They&#39;re not merely
responding to risk, but to fashion as well. Unfashionable problems
are undervalued.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the most interesting kinds of unfashionable problem is the
problem that people think has been fully explored, but hasn&#39;t.
Great work often takes something that already exists and shows its
latent potential. Durer and Watt both did this. So if you&#39;re
interested in a field that others think is tapped out, don&#39;t let
their skepticism deter you. People are often wrong about this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working on an unfashionable problem can be very pleasing. There&#39;s
no hype or hurry. Opportunists and critics are both occupied
elsewhere. The existing work often has an old-school solidity. And
there&#39;s a satisfying sense of economy in cultivating ideas that
would otherwise be wasted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the most common type of overlooked problem is not explicitly
unfashionable in the sense of being out of fashion. It just doesn&#39;t
seem to matter as much as it actually does. How do you find these?
By being self-indulgent — by letting your curiosity have its way,
and tuning out, at least temporarily, the little voice in your head
that says you should only be working on &quot;important&quot; problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You do need to work on important problems, but almost everyone is
too conservative about what counts as one. And if there&#39;s an important
but overlooked problem in your neighborhood, it&#39;s probably already
on your subconscious radar screen. So try asking yourself: if you
were going to take a break from &quot;serious&quot; work to work on something
just because it would be really interesting, what would you do? The
answer is probably more important than it seems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Originality in choosing problems seems to matter even more than
originality in solving them. That&#39;s what distinguishes the people
who discover whole new fields. So what might seem to be merely the
initial step — deciding what to work on — is in a sense the key
to the whole game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Few grasp this. One of the biggest misconceptions about new ideas
is about the ratio of question to answer in their composition.
People think big ideas are answers, but often the real insight was
in the question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part of the reason we underrate questions is the way they&#39;re used
in schools. In schools they tend to exist only briefly before being
answered, like unstable particles. But a really good question can
be much more than that. A really good question is a partial discovery.
How do new species arise? Is the force that makes objects fall to
earth the same as the one that keeps planets in their orbits? By
even asking such questions you were already in excitingly novel
territory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable things to carry around
with you. But the more you&#39;re carrying, the greater the chance of
noticing a solution — or perhaps even more excitingly, noticing
that two unanswered questions are the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes you carry a question for a long time. Great work often
comes from returning to a question you first noticed years before
— in your childhood, even — and couldn&#39;t stop thinking about.
People talk a lot about the importance of keeping your youthful
dreams alive, but it&#39;s just as important to keep your youthful
questions alive.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f19n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;19&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is one of the places where actual expertise differs most from
the popular picture of it. In the popular picture, experts are
certain. But actually the more puzzled you are, the better, so long
as (a) the things you&#39;re puzzled about matter, and (b) no one else
understands them either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Think about what&#39;s happening at the moment just before a new idea
is discovered. Often someone with sufficient expertise is puzzled
about something. Which means that originality consists partly of
puzzlement — of confusion! You have to be comfortable enough with
the world being full of puzzles that you&#39;re willing to see them,
but not so comfortable that you don&#39;t want to solve them.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f20n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;20&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s a great thing to be rich in unanswered questions. And this is
one of those situations where the rich get richer, because the best
way to acquire new questions is to try answering existing ones.
Questions don&#39;t just lead to answers, but also to more questions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The best questions grow in the answering. You notice a thread
protruding from the current paradigm and try pulling on it, and it
just gets longer and longer. So don&#39;t require a question to be
obviously big before you try answering it. You can rarely predict
that. It&#39;s hard enough even to notice the thread, let alone to
predict how much will unravel if you pull on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s better to be promiscuously curious — to pull a little bit on
a lot of threads, and see what happens. Big things start small. The
initial versions of big things were often just experiments, or side
projects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger. So start
lots of small things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being prolific is underrated. The more different things you try,
the greater the chance of discovering something new. Understand,
though, that trying lots of things will mean trying lots of things
that don&#39;t work. You can&#39;t have a lot of good ideas without also
having a lot of bad ones.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f21n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;21&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though it sounds more responsible to begin by studying everything
that&#39;s been done before, you&#39;ll learn faster and have more fun by
trying stuff. And you&#39;ll understand previous work better when you
do look at it. So err on the side of starting. Which is easier when
starting means starting small; those two ideas fit together like
two puzzle pieces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do you get from starting small to doing something great? By
making successive versions. Great things are almost always made in
successive versions. You start with something small and evolve it,
and the final version is both cleverer and more ambitious than
anything you could have planned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s particularly useful to make successive versions when you&#39;re
making something for people — to get an initial version in front
of them quickly, and then evolve it based on their response.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Begin by trying the simplest thing that could possibly work.
Surprisingly often, it does. If it doesn&#39;t, this will at least get
you started.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t try to cram too much new stuff into any one version. There
are names for doing this with the first version (taking too long
to ship) and the second (the second system effect), but these are
both merely instances of a more general principle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An early version of a new project will sometimes be dismissed as a
toy. It&#39;s a good sign when people do this. That means it has
everything a new idea needs except scale, and that tends to follow.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f22n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;22&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The alternative to starting with something small and evolving it
is to plan in advance what you&#39;re going to do. And planning does
usually seem the more responsible choice. It sounds more organized
to say &quot;we&#39;re going to do x and then y and then z&quot; than &quot;we&#39;re going
to try x and see what happens.&quot; And it is more &lt;i&gt;organized&lt;/i&gt;; it just
doesn&#39;t work as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Planning per se isn&#39;t good. It&#39;s sometimes necessary, but it&#39;s a
necessary evil — a response to unforgiving conditions. It&#39;s something
you have to do because you&#39;re working with inflexible media, or
because you need to coordinate the efforts of a lot of people. If
you keep projects small and use flexible media, you don&#39;t have to
plan as much, and your designs can evolve instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Take as much risk as you can afford. In an efficient market, risk
is proportionate to reward, so don&#39;t look for certainty, but for a
bet with high expected value. If you&#39;re not failing occasionally,
you&#39;re probably being too conservative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though conservatism is usually associated with the old, it&#39;s the
young who tend to make this mistake. Inexperience makes them fear
risk, but it&#39;s when you&#39;re young that you can afford the most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even a project that fails can be valuable. In the process of working
on it, you&#39;ll have crossed territory few others have seen, and
encountered questions few others have asked. And there&#39;s probably
no better source of questions than the ones you encounter in trying
to do something slightly too hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Use the advantages of youth when you have them, and the advantages
of age once you have those. The advantages of youth are energy,
time, optimism, and freedom. The advantages of age are knowledge,
efficiency, money, and power. With effort you can acquire some of
the latter when young and keep some of the former when old.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The old also have the advantage of knowing which advantages they
have. The young often have them without realizing it. The biggest
is probably time. The young have no idea how rich they are in time.
The best way to turn this time to advantage is to use it in slightly
frivolous ways: to learn about something you don&#39;t need to know
about, just out of curiosity, or to try building something just
because it would be cool, or to become freakishly good at something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That &quot;slightly&quot; is an important qualification. Spend time lavishly
when you&#39;re young, but don&#39;t simply waste it. There&#39;s a big difference
between doing something you worry might be a waste of time and doing
something you know for sure will be. The former is at least a bet,
and possibly a better one than you think.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f23n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;23&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most subtle advantage of youth, or more precisely of inexperience,
is that you&#39;re seeing everything with fresh eyes. When your brain
embraces an idea for the first time, sometimes the two don&#39;t fit
together perfectly. Usually the problem is with your brain, but
occasionally it&#39;s with the idea. A piece of it sticks out awkwardly
and jabs you when you think about it. People who are used to the
idea have learned to ignore it, but you have the opportunity not
to.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f24n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;24&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when you&#39;re learning about something for the first time, pay
attention to things that seem wrong or missing. You&#39;ll be tempted
to ignore them, since there&#39;s a 99% chance the problem is with you.
And you may have to set aside your misgivings temporarily to keep
progressing. But don&#39;t forget about them. When you&#39;ve gotten further
into the subject, come back and check if they&#39;re still there. If
they&#39;re still viable in the light of your present knowledge, they
probably represent an undiscovered idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One of the most valuable kinds of knowledge you get from experience
is to know what you &lt;i&gt;don&#39;t&lt;/i&gt; have to worry about. The young know all
the things that could matter, but not their relative importance.
So they worry equally about everything, when they should worry much
more about a few things and hardly at all about the rest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what you don&#39;t know is only half the problem with inexperience.
The other half is what you do know that ain&#39;t so. You arrive at
adulthood with your head full of nonsense — bad habits you&#39;ve
acquired and false things you&#39;ve been taught — and you won&#39;t be
able to do great work till you clear away at least the nonsense in
the way of whatever type of work you want to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much of the nonsense left in your head is left there by schools.
We&#39;re so used to schools that we unconsciously treat going to school
as identical with learning, but in fact schools have all sorts of
strange qualities that warp our ideas about learning and thinking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, schools induce passivity. Since you were a small child,
there was an authority at the front of the class telling all of you
what you had to learn and then measuring whether you did. But neither
classes nor tests are intrinsic to learning; they&#39;re just artifacts
of the way schools are usually designed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sooner you overcome this passivity, the better. If you&#39;re still
in school, try thinking of your education as your project, and your
teachers as working for you rather than vice versa. That may seem
a stretch, but it&#39;s not merely some weird thought experiment. It&#39;s
the truth economically, and in the best case it&#39;s the truth
intellectually as well. The best teachers don&#39;t want to be your
bosses. They&#39;d prefer it if you pushed ahead, using them as a source
of advice, rather than being pulled by them through the material.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Schools also give you a misleading impression of what work is like.
In school they tell you what the problems are, and they&#39;re almost
always soluble using no more than you&#39;ve been taught so far. In
real life you have to figure out what the problems are, and you
often don&#39;t know if they&#39;re soluble at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But perhaps the worst thing schools do to you is train you to win
by hacking the test. You can&#39;t do great work by doing that. You
can&#39;t trick God. So stop looking for that kind of shortcut. The way
to beat the system is to focus on problems and solutions that others
have overlooked, not to skimp on the work itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don&#39;t think of yourself as dependent on some gatekeeper giving you
a &quot;big break.&quot; Even if this were true, the best way to get it would
be to focus on doing good work rather than chasing influential
people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And don&#39;t take rejection by committees to heart. The qualities that
impress admissions officers and prize committees are quite different
from those required to do great work. The decisions of selection
committees are only meaningful to the extent that they&#39;re part of
a feedback loop, and very few are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
People new to a field will often copy existing work. There&#39;s nothing
inherently bad about that. There&#39;s no better way to learn how
something works than by trying to reproduce it. Nor does
copying necessarily make your work unoriginal. Originality is the
presence of new ideas, not the absence of old ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s a good way to copy and a bad way. If you&#39;re going to copy
something, do it openly instead of furtively, or worse still,
unconsciously. This is what&#39;s meant by the famously misattributed
phrase &quot;Great artists steal.&quot; The really dangerous kind of copying,
the kind that gives copying a bad name, is the kind that&#39;s done
without realizing it, because you&#39;re nothing more than a train
running on tracks laid down by someone else. But at the other
extreme, copying can be a sign of superiority rather than subordination.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f25n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;25&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In many fields it&#39;s almost inevitable that your early work will be
in some sense based on other people&#39;s. Projects rarely arise in a
vacuum. They&#39;re usually a reaction to previous work. When you&#39;re
first starting out, you don&#39;t have any previous work; if you&#39;re
going to react to something, it has to be someone else&#39;s. Once
you&#39;re established, you can react to your own. But while the former
gets called derivative and the latter doesn&#39;t, structurally the two
cases are more similar than they seem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oddly enough, the very novelty of the most novel ideas sometimes
makes them seem at first to be more derivative than they are. New
discoveries often have to be conceived initially as variations of
existing things, &lt;i&gt;even by their discoverers&lt;/i&gt;, because there isn&#39;t
yet the conceptual vocabulary to express them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are definitely some dangers to copying, though. One is that
you&#39;ll tend to copy old things — things that were in their day at
the frontier of knowledge, but no longer are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And when you do copy something, don&#39;t copy every feature of it.
Some will make you ridiculous if you do. Don&#39;t copy the manner of
an eminent 50 year old professor if you&#39;re 18, for example, or the
idiom of a Renaissance poem hundreds of years later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of the features of things you admire are flaws they succeeded
despite. Indeed, the features that are easiest to imitate are the
most likely to be the flaws.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is particularly true for behavior. Some talented people are
jerks, and this sometimes makes it seem to the inexperienced that
being a jerk is part of being talented. It isn&#39;t; being talented
is merely how they get away with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to copy something from
one field into another. History is so full of chance discoveries
of this type that it&#39;s probably worth giving chance a hand by
deliberately learning about other kinds of work. You can take ideas
from quite distant fields if you let them be metaphors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Negative examples can be as inspiring as positive ones. In fact you
can sometimes learn more from things done badly than from things
done well; sometimes it only becomes clear what&#39;s needed when it&#39;s
missing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If a lot of the best people in your field are collected in one
place, it&#39;s usually a good idea to visit for a while. It will
increase your ambition, and also, by showing you that these people
are human, increase your self-confidence.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f26n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;26&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&#39;re earnest you&#39;ll probably get a warmer welcome than you
might expect. Most people who are very good at something are happy
to talk about it with anyone who&#39;s genuinely interested. If they&#39;re
really good at their work, then they probably have a hobbyist&#39;s
interest in it, and hobbyists always want to talk about their
hobbies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It may take some effort to find the people who are really good,
though. Doing great work has such prestige that in some places,
particularly universities, there&#39;s a polite fiction that everyone
is engaged in it. And that is far from true. People within universities
can&#39;t say so openly, but the quality of the work being done in
different departments varies immensely. Some departments have people
doing great work; others have in the past; others never have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Seek out the best colleagues. There are a lot of projects that can&#39;t
be done alone, and even if you&#39;re working on one that can be, it&#39;s
good to have other people to encourage you and to bounce ideas off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colleagues don&#39;t just affect your work, though; they also affect
you. So work with people you want to become like, because you will.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quality is more important than quantity in colleagues. It&#39;s better
to have one or two great ones than a building full of pretty good
ones. In fact it&#39;s not merely better, but necessary, judging from
history: the degree to which great work happens in clusters suggests
that one&#39;s colleagues often make the difference between doing great
work and not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do you know when you have sufficiently good colleagues? In my
experience, when you do, you know. Which means if you&#39;re unsure,
you probably don&#39;t. But it may be possible to give a more concrete
answer than that. Here&#39;s an attempt: sufficiently good colleagues
offer &lt;i&gt;surprising&lt;/i&gt; insights. They can see and do things that you
can&#39;t. So if you have a handful of colleagues good enough to keep
you on your toes in this sense, you&#39;re probably over the threshold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of us can benefit from collaborating with colleagues, but some
projects require people on a larger scale, and starting one of those
is not for everyone. If you want to run a project like that, you&#39;ll
have to become a manager, and managing well takes aptitude and
interest like any other kind of work. If you don&#39;t have them, there
is no middle path: you must either force yourself to learn management
as a second language, or avoid such projects.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f27n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;27&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Husband your morale. It&#39;s the basis of everything when you&#39;re working
on ambitious projects. You have to nurture and protect it like a
living organism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Morale starts with your view of life. You&#39;re more likely to do great
work if you&#39;re an optimist, and more likely to if you think of
yourself as lucky than if you think of yourself as a victim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, work can to some extent protect you from your problems. If
you choose work that&#39;s pure, its very difficulties will serve as a
refuge from the difficulties of everyday life. If this is escapism,
it&#39;s a very productive form of it, and one that has been used by
some of the greatest minds in history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Morale compounds via work: high morale helps you do good work, which
increases your morale and helps you do even better work. But this
cycle also operates in the other direction: if you&#39;re not doing
good work, that can demoralize you and make it even harder to. Since
it matters so much for this cycle to be running in the right
direction, it can be a good idea to switch to easier work when
you&#39;re stuck, just so you start to get something done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the biggest mistakes ambitious people make is to allow
setbacks to destroy their morale all at once, like a balloon bursting.
You can inoculate yourself against this by explicitly considering
setbacks a part of your process. Solving hard problems always
involves some backtracking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is the
desire to. So &quot;If at first you don&#39;t succeed, try, try again&quot; isn&#39;t
quite right. It should be: If at first you don&#39;t succeed, either
try again, or backtrack and then try again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Never give up&quot; is also not quite right. Obviously there are times
when it&#39;s the right choice to eject. A more precise version would
be: Never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than you
need to. Corollary: Never abandon the root node.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s not necessarily a bad sign if work is a struggle, any more
than it&#39;s a bad sign to be out of breath while running. It depends
how fast you&#39;re running. So learn to distinguish good pain from
bad. Good pain is a sign of effort; bad pain is a sign of damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An audience is a critical component of morale. If you&#39;re a scholar,
your audience may be your peers; in the arts, it may be an audience
in the traditional sense. Either way it doesn&#39;t need to be big.
The value of an audience doesn&#39;t grow anything like linearly with
its size. Which is bad news if you&#39;re famous, but good news if
you&#39;re just starting out, because it means a small but dedicated
audience can be enough to sustain you. If a handful of people
genuinely love what you&#39;re doing, that&#39;s enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To the extent you can, avoid letting intermediaries come between
you and your audience. In some types of work this is inevitable,
but it&#39;s so liberating to escape it that you might be better off
switching to an adjacent type if that will let you go direct.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f28n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;28&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The people you spend time with will also have a big effect on your
morale. You&#39;ll find there are some who increase your energy and
others who decrease it, and the effect someone has is not always
what you&#39;d expect. Seek out the people who increase your energy and
avoid those who decrease it. Though of course if there&#39;s someone
you need to take care of, that takes precedence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t marry someone who doesn&#39;t understand that you need to work,
or sees your work as competition for your attention. If you&#39;re
ambitious, you need to work; it&#39;s almost like a medical condition;
so someone who won&#39;t let you work either doesn&#39;t understand you,
or does and doesn&#39;t care.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ultimately morale is physical. You think with your body, so it&#39;s
important to take care of it. That means exercising regularly,
eating and sleeping well, and avoiding the more dangerous kinds of
drugs. Running and walking are particularly good forms of exercise
because they&#39;re good for thinking.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f29n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;29&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People who do great work are not necessarily happier than everyone
else, but they&#39;re happier than they&#39;d be if they didn&#39;t. In fact,
if you&#39;re smart and ambitious, it&#39;s dangerous &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to be productive.
People who are smart and ambitious but don&#39;t achieve much tend to
become bitter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It&#39;s ok to want to impress other people, but choose the right people.
The opinion of people you respect is signal. Fame, which is the
opinion of a much larger group you might or might not respect, just
adds noise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The prestige of a type of work is at best a trailing indicator and
sometimes completely mistaken. If you do anything well enough,
you&#39;ll make it prestigious. So the question to ask about a type of
work is not how much prestige it has, but how well it could be done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Competition can be an effective motivator, but don&#39;t let it choose
the problem for you; don&#39;t let yourself get drawn into chasing
something just because others are. In fact, don&#39;t let competitors
make you do anything much more specific than work harder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Curiosity is the best guide. Your curiosity never lies, and it knows
more than you do about what&#39;s worth paying attention to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Notice how often that word has come up. If you asked an oracle the
secret to doing great work and the oracle replied with a single
word, my bet would be on &quot;curiosity.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That doesn&#39;t translate directly to advice. It&#39;s not enough just to
be curious, and you can&#39;t command curiosity anyway. But you can
nurture it and let it drive you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will
choose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to
notice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them. The whole
process is a kind of dance with curiosity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Believe it or not, I tried to make this essay as short as I could.
But its length at least means it acts as a filter. If you made it
this far, you must be interested in doing great work. And if so
you&#39;re already further along than you might realize, because the
set of people willing to want to is small.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The factors in doing great work are factors in the literal,
mathematical sense, and they are: ability, interest, effort, and
luck. Luck by definition you can&#39;t do anything about, so we can
ignore that. And we can assume effort, if you do in fact want to
do great work. So the problem boils down to ability and interest.
Can you find a kind of work where your ability and interest will
combine to yield an explosion of new ideas?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here there are grounds for optimism. There are so many different
ways to do great work, and even more that are still undiscovered.
Out of all those different types of work, the one you&#39;re most suited
for is probably a pretty close match. Probably a comically close
match. It&#39;s just a question of finding it, and how far into it your
ability and interest can take you. And you can only answer that by
trying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many more people could try to do great work than do. What holds
them back is a combination of modesty and fear. It seems presumptuous
to try to be Newton or Shakespeare. It also seems hard; surely if
you tried something like that, you&#39;d fail. Presumably the calculation
is rarely explicit. Few people consciously decide not to try to do
great work. But that&#39;s what&#39;s going on subconsciously; they shy
away from the question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I&#39;m going to pull a sneaky trick on you. Do you want to do great
work, or not? Now you have to decide consciously. Sorry about that.
I wouldn&#39;t have done it to a general audience. But we already know
you&#39;re interested.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t worry about being presumptuous. You don&#39;t have to tell anyone.
And if it&#39;s too hard and you fail, so what? Lots of people have
worse problems than that. In fact you&#39;ll be lucky if it&#39;s the worst
problem you have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, you&#39;ll have to work hard. But again, lots of people have to
work hard. And if you&#39;re working on something you find very
interesting, which you necessarily will if you&#39;re on the right path,
the work will probably feel less burdensome than a lot of your
peers&#39;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The discoveries are out there, waiting to be made. Why not by you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I don&#39;t think you could give a precise definition of what
counts as great work. Doing great work means doing something important
so well that you expand people&#39;s ideas of what&#39;s possible. But
there&#39;s no threshold for importance. It&#39;s a matter of degree, and
often hard to judge at the time anyway. So I&#39;d rather people focused
on developing their interests rather than worrying about whether
they&#39;re important or not. Just try to do something amazing, and
leave it to future generations to say if you succeeded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
A lot of standup comedy is based on noticing anomalies in
everyday life. &quot;Did you ever notice...?&quot; New ideas come from doing
this about nontrivial things. Which may help explain why people&#39;s
reaction to a new idea is often the first half of laughing: Ha!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
That second qualifier is critical. If you&#39;re excited about
something most authorities discount, but you can&#39;t give a more
precise explanation than &quot;they don&#39;t get it,&quot; then you&#39;re starting
to drift into the territory of cranks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Finding something to work on is not simply a matter of finding
a match between the current version of you and a list of known
problems. You&#39;ll often have to coevolve with the problem. That&#39;s
why it can sometimes be so hard to figure out what to work on. The
search space is huge. It&#39;s the cartesian product of all possible
types of work, both known and yet to be discovered, and all possible
future versions of you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s no way you could search this whole space, so you have to
rely on heuristics to generate promising paths through it and hope
the best matches will be clustered. Which they will not always be;
different types of work have been collected together as much by
accidents of history as by the intrinsic similarities between them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
There are many reasons curious people are more likely to do
great work, but one of the more subtle is that, by casting a wide
net, they&#39;re more likely to find the right thing to work on in the
first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f6n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
It can also be dangerous to make things for an audience you
feel is less sophisticated than you, if that causes you to talk
down to them. You can make a lot of money doing that, if you do it
in a sufficiently cynical way, but it&#39;s not the route to great work.
Not that anyone using this m.o. would care.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f7n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
This idea I learned from Hardy&#39;s &lt;i&gt;A Mathematician&#39;s Apology&lt;/i&gt;,
which I recommend to anyone ambitious to do great work, in any
field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f8n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Just as we overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate
what we can do over several years, we overestimate the damage done
by procrastinating for a day and underestimate the damage done by
procrastinating for several years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f9n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
You can&#39;t usually get paid for doing exactly what you want,
especially early on. There are two options: get paid for doing work
close to what you want and hope to push it closer, or get paid for
doing something else entirely and do your own projects on the side.
Both can work, but both have drawbacks: in the first approach your
work is compromised by default, and in the second you have to fight
to get time to do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f10n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;10&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
If you set your life up right, it will deliver the focus-relax
cycle automatically. The perfect setup is an office you work in and
that you walk to and from.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f11n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;11&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
There may be some very unworldly people who do great work
without consciously trying to. If you want to expand this rule to
cover that case, it becomes: Don&#39;t try to be anything except the
best.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f12n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;12&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
This gets more complicated in work like acting, where the
goal is to adopt a fake persona. But even here it&#39;s possible to be
affected. Perhaps the rule in such fields should be to avoid
&lt;i&gt;unintentional&lt;/i&gt; affectation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f13n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;13&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
It&#39;s safe to have beliefs that you treat as unquestionable
if and only if they&#39;re also unfalsifiable. For example, it&#39;s safe
to have the principle that everyone should be treated equally under
the law, because a sentence with a &quot;should&quot; in it isn&#39;t really a
statement about the world and is therefore hard to disprove. And
if there&#39;s no evidence that could disprove one of your principles,
there can&#39;t be any facts you&#39;d need to ignore in order to preserve
it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f14n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;14&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Affectation is easier to cure than intellectual dishonesty.
Affectation is often a shortcoming of the young that burns off in
time, while intellectual dishonesty is more of a character flaw.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f15n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;15&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Obviously you don&#39;t have to be working at the exact moment
you have the idea, but you&#39;ll probably have been working fairly
recently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f16n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;16&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Some say psychoactive drugs have a similar effect. I&#39;m
skeptical, but also almost totally ignorant of their effects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f17n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;17&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
For example you might give the nth most important topic
(m-1)/m^n of your attention, for some m &amp;gt; 1. You couldn&#39;t allocate
your attention so precisely, of course, but this at least gives an
idea of a reasonable distribution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f18n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;18&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The principles defining a religion have to be mistaken.
Otherwise anyone might adopt them, and there would be nothing to
distinguish the adherents of the religion from everyone else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f19n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;19&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
It might be a good exercise to try writing down a list of
questions you wondered about in your youth. You might find you&#39;re
now in a position to do something about some of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f20n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;20&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The connection between originality and uncertainty causes a
strange phenomenon: because the conventional-minded are more certain
than the independent-minded, this tends to give them the upper hand
in disputes, even though they&#39;re generally stupider.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
   The best lack all conviction, while the worst&lt;br&gt;
   Are full of passionate intensity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[&lt;a name=&quot;f21n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;21&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Derived from Linus Pauling&#39;s &quot;If you want to have good ideas,
you must have many ideas.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f22n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;22&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Attacking a project as a &quot;toy&quot; is similar to attacking a
statement as &quot;inappropriate.&quot; It means that no more substantial
criticism can be made to stick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f23n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;23&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
One way to tell whether you&#39;re wasting time is to ask if
you&#39;re producing or consuming. Writing computer games is less likely
to be a waste of time than playing them, and playing games where
you create something is less likely to be a waste of time than
playing games where you don&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f24n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;24&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Another related advantage is that if you haven&#39;t said anything
publicly yet, you won&#39;t be biased toward evidence that supports
your earlier conclusions. With sufficient integrity you could achieve
eternal youth in this respect, but few manage to. For most people,
having previously published opinions has an effect similar to
ideology, just in quantity 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f25n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;25&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
In the early 1630s Daniel Mytens made a painting of Henrietta
Maria handing a laurel wreath to Charles I. Van Dyck then painted
his own version to show how much better he was.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f26n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;26&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I&#39;m being deliberately vague about what a place is. As of
this writing, being in the same physical place has advantages that
are hard to duplicate, but that could change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f27n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;27&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
This is false when the work the other people have to do is
very constrained, as with SETI@home or Bitcoin. It may be possible
to expand the area in which it&#39;s false by defining similarly
restricted protocols with more freedom of action in the nodes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f28n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;28&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Corollary: Building something that enables people to go around
intermediaries and engage directly with their audience is probably
a good idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f29n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;29&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
It may be helpful always to walk or run the same route, because
that frees attention for thinking. It feels that way to me, and
there is some historical evidence for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;888888&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt;

of different fields, what would the intersection look like? I decided
to find out by making it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Partly my goal was to create a guide that could be used by someone
working in any field. But I was also curious about the shape of the
intersection. And one thing this exercise shows is that it does
have a definite shape; it&#39;s not just a point labelled &quot;work hard.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The following recipe assumes you&#39;re very ambitious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose
needs to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a
natural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that
offers scope to do great work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In practice you don&#39;t have to worry much about the third criterion.
Ambitious people are if anything already too conservative about it.
So all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for
and great interest in.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That sounds straightforward, but it&#39;s often quite difficult. When
you&#39;re young you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re good at or what different
kinds of work are like. Some kinds of work you end up doing may not
even exist yet. So while some people know what they want to do at
14, most have to figure it out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you&#39;re not
sure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going.
You&#39;ll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that&#39;s fine. It&#39;s
good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries
come from noticing connections between different fields.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don&#39;t let &quot;work&quot;
mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do
great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own.
It may be within some bigger project, but you&#39;ll be driving your
part of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly
ambitious. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves,
exciting and important will converge. At 7 it may seem excitingly
ambitious to build huge things out of Lego, then at 14 to teach
yourself calculus, till at 21 you&#39;re starting to explore unanswered
questions in physics. But always preserve excitingness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s a kind of excited curiosity that&#39;s both the engine and the
rudder of great work. It will not only drive you, but if you let
it have its way, will also show you what to work on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What are you excessively curious about — curious to a degree that
would bore most other people? That&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once you&#39;ve found something you&#39;re excessively interested in, the
next step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the
frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge expands fractally, and from a
distance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get
close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next step is to notice them. This takes some skill, because
your brain wants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simpler
model of the world. Many discoveries have come from asking questions
about things that everyone else took for granted. 
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the answers seem strange, so much the better. Great work often
has a tincture of strangeness. You see this from painting to math.
It would be affected to try to manufacture it, but if it appears,
embrace it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boldly chase outlier ideas, even if other people aren&#39;t interested
in them — in fact, especially if they aren&#39;t. If you&#39;re excited
about some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you have
enough expertise to say precisely what they&#39;re all overlooking,
that&#39;s as good a bet as you&#39;ll find.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier,
notice gaps, explore promising ones. This is how practically everyone
who&#39;s done great work has done it, from painters to physicists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Steps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible
to prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but the
empirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality.
That&#39;s why it&#39;s essential to work on something you&#39;re deeply
interested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere
diligence ever could.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the
desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and
that combination is the most powerful of all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The big prize is to discover a new fractal bud. You notice a crack
in the surface of knowledge, pry it open, and there&#39;s a whole world
inside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let&#39;s talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring
out what to work on. The main reason it&#39;s hard is that you can&#39;t
tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. Which
means the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something for
years before you know how much you like it or how good you are at
it. And in the meantime you&#39;re not doing, and thus not learning
about, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you choose
late based on very incomplete information.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes in
two forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that
grows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the
more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what
to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The educational systems in most countries pretend it&#39;s easy. They
expect you to commit to a field long before you could know what
it&#39;s really like. And as a result an ambitious person on an optimal
trajectory will often read to the system as an instance of breakage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would be better if they at least admitted it — if they admitted
that the system not only can&#39;t do much to help you figure out what
to work on, but is designed on the assumption that you&#39;ll somehow
magically guess as a teenager. They don&#39;t tell you, but I will:
when it comes to figuring out what to work on, you&#39;re on your own.
Some people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest will
find themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on
the assumption that everyone does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What should you do if you&#39;re young and ambitious but don&#39;t know
what to work on? What you should &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; do is drift along passively,
assuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action.
But there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read
biographies of people who&#39;ve done great work, it&#39;s remarkable how
much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result
of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up.
So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to
do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people,
read lots of books, ask lots of questions.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you
learn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very
different from what you do in high school math classes. So you need
to give different types of work a chance to show you what they&#39;re
like. But a field should become &lt;i&gt;increasingly&lt;/i&gt; interesting as you
learn more about it. If it doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s probably not for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t worry if you find you&#39;re interested in different things than
other people. The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the
better. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste
for work means you&#39;ll be productive. And you&#39;re more likely to find
new things if you&#39;re looking where few have looked before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One sign that you&#39;re suited for some kind of work is when you like
even the parts that other people find tedious or frightening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But fields aren&#39;t people; you don&#39;t owe them any loyalty. If in the
course of working on one thing you discover another that&#39;s more
exciting, don&#39;t be afraid to switch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&#39;re making something for people, make sure it&#39;s something
they actually want. The best way to do this is to make something
you yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the tool
you want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests,
this will also get you your initial audience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; follow from the excitingness rule. Obviously the most
exciting story to write will be the one you want to read. The reason
I mention this case explicitly is that so many people get it wrong.
Instead of making what they want, they try to make what some
imaginary, more sophisticated audience wants. And once you go down
that route, you&#39;re lost.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f6n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you&#39;re
trying to figure out what to work on. Pretentiousness, fashion,
fear, money, politics, other people&#39;s wishes, eminent frauds. But
if you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you&#39;ll be proof
against all of them. If you&#39;re interested, you&#39;re not astray.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Following your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy,
but in practice it usually means following them past all sorts of
obstacles. You usually have to risk rejection and failure. So it
does take a good deal of boldness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But while you need boldness, you don&#39;t usually need much planning.
In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard
on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of
it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try
to preserve certain invariants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements
you can describe in advance. You can win a gold medal or get rich
by deciding to as a child and then tenaciously pursuing that goal,
but you can&#39;t discover natural selection that way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy
is not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most
interesting and gives you the best options for the future. I call
this approach &quot;staying upwind.&quot; This is how most people who&#39;ve done
great work seem to have done it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Even when you&#39;ve found something exciting to work on, working on
it is not always straightforward. There will be times when some new
idea makes you leap out of bed in the morning and get straight to
work. But there will also be plenty of times when things aren&#39;t
like that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You don&#39;t just put out your sail and get blown forward by inspiration.
There are headwinds and currents and hidden shoals. So there&#39;s a
technique to working, just as there is to sailing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, while you must work hard, it&#39;s possible to work too
hard, and if you do that you&#39;ll find you get diminishing returns:
fatigue will make you stupid, and eventually even damage your health.
The point at which work yields diminishing returns depends on the
type. Some of the hardest types you might only be able to do for
four or five hours a day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ideally those hours will be contiguous. To the extent you can, try
to arrange your life so you have big blocks of time to work in.
You&#39;ll shy away from hard tasks if you know you might be interrupted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working.
You&#39;ll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial
threshold. Don&#39;t worry about this; it&#39;s the nature of work, not a
flaw in your character. Work has a sort of activation energy, both
per day and per project. And since this threshold is fake in the
sense that it&#39;s higher than the energy required to keep going, it&#39;s
ok to tell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over
it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s usually a mistake to lie to yourself if you want to do great
work, but this is one of the rare cases where it isn&#39;t. When I&#39;m
reluctant to start work in the morning, I often trick myself by
saying &quot;I&#39;ll just read over what I&#39;ve got so far.&quot; Five minutes
later I&#39;ve found something that seems mistaken or incomplete, and
I&#39;m off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similar techniques work for starting new projects. It&#39;s ok to lie
to yourself about how much work a project will entail, for example.
Lots of great things began with someone saying &quot;How hard could it
be?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is one case where the young have an advantage. They&#39;re more
optimistic, and even though one of the sources of their optimism
is ignorance, in this case ignorance can sometimes beat knowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be
more work than you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercise
in tidiness or self-discipline. In many projects a lot of the best
work happens in what was meant to be the final stage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another permissible lie is to exaggerate the importance of what
you&#39;re working on, at least in your own mind. If that helps you
discover something new, it may turn out not to have been a lie after
all.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f7n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Since there are two senses of starting work — per day and per
project — there are also two forms of procrastination. Per-project
procrastination is far the more dangerous. You put off starting
that ambitious project from year to year because the time isn&#39;t
quite right. When you&#39;re procrastinating in units of years, you can
get a lot not done.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f8n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it
usually camouflages itself as work. You&#39;re not just sitting around
doing nothing; you&#39;re working industriously on something else. So
per-project procrastination doesn&#39;t set off the alarms that per-day
procrastination does. You&#39;re too busy to notice it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I
working on what I most want to work on? When you&#39;re young it&#39;s ok
if the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous
as you get older.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f9n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people
an unreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can&#39;t think of
this time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find the
work sufficiently engaging as it&#39;s happening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years
at things you hate before you get to the good part, but this is not
how great work happens. Great work happens by focusing consistently
on something you&#39;re genuinely interested in. When you pause to take
stock, you&#39;re surprised how far you&#39;ve come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason we&#39;re surprised is that we underestimate the cumulative
effect of work. Writing a page a day doesn&#39;t sound like much, but
if you do it every day you&#39;ll write a book a year. That&#39;s the key:
consistency. People who do great things don&#39;t get a lot done every
day. They get something done, rather than nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you do work that compounds, you&#39;ll get exponential growth. Most
people who do this do it unconsciously, but it&#39;s worth stopping to
think about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon:
the more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more.
Growing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the more
new fans they&#39;ll bring you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat
in the beginning. It isn&#39;t; it&#39;s still a wonderful exponential
curve. But we can&#39;t grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential
growth in its early stages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it&#39;s
worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. But since
we underrate exponential growth early on, this too is mostly done
unconsciously: people push through the initial, unrewarding phase
of learning something new because they know from experience that
learning new things always takes an initial push, or they grow their
audience one fan at a time because they have nothing better to do.
If people consciously realized they could invest in exponential
growth, many more would do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Work doesn&#39;t just happen when you&#39;re trying to. There&#39;s a kind of
undirected thinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lying
in bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind wander a
little, you&#39;ll often solve problems you were unable to solve by
frontal attack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have to be working hard in the normal way to benefit from this
phenomenon, though. You can&#39;t just walk around daydreaming. The
daydreaming has to be interleaved with deliberate work that feeds
it questions.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f10n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;10&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone knows to avoid distractions at work, but it&#39;s also important
to avoid them in the other half of the cycle. When you let your
mind wander, it wanders to whatever you care about most at that
moment. So avoid the kind of distraction that pushes your work out
of the top spot, or you&#39;ll waste this valuable type of thinking on
the distraction instead. (Exception: Don&#39;t avoid love.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Consciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field.
Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don&#39;t
know what you&#39;re aiming for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; what you&#39;re aiming for, because if you don&#39;t try to
be the best, you won&#39;t even be good. This observation has been made
by so many people in so many different fields that it might be worth
thinking about why it&#39;s true. It could be because ambition is a
phenomenon where almost all the error is in one direction — where
almost all the shells that miss the target miss by falling short.
Or it could be because ambition to be the best is a qualitatively
different thing from ambition to be good. Or maybe being good is
simply too vague a standard. Probably all three are true.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f11n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;11&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunately there&#39;s a kind of economy of scale here. Though it might
seem like you&#39;d be taking on a heavy burden by trying to be the
best, in practice you often end up net ahead. It&#39;s exciting, and
also strangely liberating. It simplifies things. In some ways it&#39;s
easier to try to be the best than to try merely to be good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One way to aim high is to try to make something that people will
care about in a hundred years. Not because their opinions matter
more than your contemporaries&#39;, but because something that still
seems good in a hundred years is more likely to be genuinely good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don&#39;t try to work in a distinctive style. Just try to do the best
job you can; you won&#39;t be able to help doing it in a distinctive
way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Style is doing things in a distinctive way without trying to. Trying
to is affectation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Affectation is in effect to pretend that someone other than you is
doing the work. You adopt an impressive but fake persona, and while
you&#39;re pleased with the impressiveness, the fakeness is what shows
in the work.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f12n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;12&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The temptation to be someone else is greatest for the young. They
often feel like nobodies. But you never need to worry about that
problem, because it&#39;s self-solving if you work on sufficiently
ambitious projects. If you succeed at an ambitious project, you&#39;re
not a nobody; you&#39;re the person who did it. So just do the work and
your identity will take care of itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Avoid affectation&quot; is a useful rule so far as it goes, but how
would you express this idea positively? How would you say what to
be, instead of what not to be? The best answer is earnest. If you&#39;re
earnest you avoid not just affectation but a whole set of similar
vices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The core of being earnest is being intellectually honest. We&#39;re
taught as children to be honest as an unselfish virtue — as a kind
of sacrifice. But in fact it&#39;s a source of power too. To see new
ideas, you need an exceptionally sharp eye for the truth. You&#39;re
trying to see more truth than others have seen so far. And how can
you have a sharp eye for the truth if you&#39;re intellectually dishonest?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One way to avoid intellectual dishonesty is to maintain a slight
positive pressure in the opposite direction. Be aggressively willing
to admit that you&#39;re mistaken. Once you&#39;ve admitted you were mistaken
about something, you&#39;re free. Till then you have to carry it.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f13n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;13&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another more subtle component of earnestness is informality.
Informality is much more important than its grammatically negative
name implies. It&#39;s not merely the absence of something. It means
focusing on what matters instead of what doesn&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What formality and affectation have in common is that as well as
doing the work, you&#39;re trying to seem a certain way as you&#39;re doing
it. But any energy that goes into how you seem comes out of being
good. That&#39;s one reason nerds have an advantage in doing great work:
they expend little effort on seeming anything. In fact that&#39;s
basically the definition of a nerd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness that&#39;s exactly what you need
in doing great work. It&#39;s not learned; it&#39;s preserved from childhood.
So hold onto it. Be the one who puts things out there rather than
the one who sits back and offers sophisticated-sounding criticisms
of them. &quot;It&#39;s easy to criticize&quot; is true in the most literal sense,
and the route to great work is never easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There may be some jobs where it&#39;s an advantage to be cynical and
pessimistic, but if you want to do great work it&#39;s an advantage to
be optimistic, even though that means you&#39;ll risk looking like a
fool sometimes. There&#39;s an old tradition of doing the opposite. The
Old Testament says it&#39;s better to keep quiet lest you look like a
fool. But that&#39;s advice for &lt;i&gt;seeming&lt;/i&gt; smart. If you actually want
to discover new things, it&#39;s better to take the risk of telling
people your ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some people are naturally earnest, and with others it takes a
conscious effort. Either kind of earnestness will suffice. But I
doubt it would be possible to do great work without being earnest.
It&#39;s so hard to do even if you are. You don&#39;t have enough margin
for error to accommodate the distortions introduced by being affected,
intellectually dishonest, orthodox, fashionable, or cool.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f14n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;14&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Great work is consistent not only with who did it, but with itself.
It&#39;s usually all of a piece. So if you face a decision in the middle
of working on something, ask which choice is more consistent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You may have to throw things away and redo them. You won&#39;t necessarily
have to, but you have to be willing to. And that can take some
effort; when there&#39;s something you need to redo, status quo bias
and laziness will combine to keep you in denial about it. To beat
this ask: If I&#39;d already made the change, would I want to revert
to what I have now?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have the confidence to cut. Don&#39;t keep something that doesn&#39;t fit
just because you&#39;re proud of it, or because it cost you a lot of
effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, in some kinds of work it&#39;s good to strip whatever you&#39;re
doing to its essence. The result will be more concentrated; you&#39;ll
understand it better; and you won&#39;t be able to lie to yourself about
whether there&#39;s anything real there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mathematical elegance may sound like a mere metaphor, drawn from
the arts. That&#39;s what I thought when I first heard the term &quot;elegant&quot;
applied to a proof. But now I suspect it&#39;s conceptually prior — 
that the main ingredient in artistic elegance is mathematical
elegance. At any rate it&#39;s a useful standard well beyond math.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elegance can be a long-term bet, though. Laborious solutions will
often have more prestige in the short term. They cost a lot of
effort and they&#39;re hard to understand, both of which impress people,
at least temporarily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whereas some of the very best work will seem like it took comparatively
little effort, because it was in a sense already there. It didn&#39;t
have to be built, just seen. It&#39;s a very good sign when it&#39;s hard
to say whether you&#39;re creating something or discovering it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you&#39;re doing work that could be seen as either creation or
discovery, err on the side of discovery. Try thinking of yourself
as a mere conduit through which the ideas take their natural shape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Strangely enough, one exception is the problem of choosing a problem
to work on. This is usually seen as search, but in the best case
it&#39;s more like creating something. In the best case you create the
field in the process of exploring it.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, if you&#39;re trying to build a powerful tool, make it
gratuitously unrestrictive. A powerful tool almost by definition
will be used in ways you didn&#39;t expect, so err on the side of
eliminating restrictions, even if you don&#39;t know what the benefit
will be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Great work will often be tool-like in the sense of being something
others build on. So it&#39;s a good sign if you&#39;re creating ideas that
others could use, or exposing questions that others could answer.
The best ideas have implications in many different areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you express your ideas in the most general form, they&#39;ll be truer
than you intended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
True by itself is not enough, of course. Great ideas have to be
true and new. And it takes a certain amount of ability to see new
ideas even once you&#39;ve learned enough to get to one of the frontiers
of knowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In English we give this ability names like originality, creativity,
and imagination. And it seems reasonable to give it a separate name,
because it does seem to some extent a separate skill. It&#39;s possible
to have a great deal of ability in other respects — to have a great
deal of what&#39;s often called &lt;i&gt;technical&lt;/i&gt; ability — and yet not have
much of this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve never liked the term &quot;creative process.&quot; It seems misleading.
Originality isn&#39;t a process, but a habit of mind. Original thinkers
throw off new ideas about whatever they focus on, like an angle
grinder throwing off sparks. They can&#39;t help it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the thing they&#39;re focused on is something they don&#39;t understand
very well, these new ideas might not be good. One of the most
original thinkers I know decided to focus on dating after he got
divorced. He knew roughly as much about dating as the average 15
year old, and the results were spectacularly colorful. But to see
originality separated from expertise like that made its nature all
the more clear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible to cultivate originality, but there
are definitely ways to make the most of however much you have. For
example, you&#39;re much more likely to have original ideas when you&#39;re
working on something. Original ideas don&#39;t come from trying to have
original ideas. They come from trying to build or understand something
slightly too difficult.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f15n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;15&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking or writing about the things you&#39;re interested in is a good
way to generate new ideas. When you try to put ideas into words, a
missing idea creates a sort of vacuum that draws it out of you.
Indeed, there&#39;s a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Changing your context can help. If you visit a new place, you&#39;ll
often find you have new ideas there. The journey itself often
dislodges them. But you may not have to go far to get this benefit.
Sometimes it&#39;s enough just to go for a walk.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f16n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;16&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It also helps to travel in topic space. You&#39;ll have more new ideas
if you explore lots of different topics, partly because it gives
the angle grinder more surface area to work on, and partly because
analogies are an especially fruitful source of new ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t divide your attention &lt;i&gt;evenly&lt;/i&gt; between many topics though,
or you&#39;ll spread yourself too thin. You want to distribute it
according to something more like a power law.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f17n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;17&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
Be professionally
curious about a few topics and idly curious about many more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Curiosity and originality are closely related. Curiosity feeds
originality by giving it new things to work on. But the relationship
is closer than that. Curiosity is itself a kind of originality;
it&#39;s roughly to questions what originality is to answers. And since
questions at their best are a big component of answers, curiosity
at its best is a creative force.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Having new ideas is a strange game, because it usually consists of
seeing things that were right under your nose. Once you&#39;ve seen a
new idea, it tends to seem obvious. Why did no one think of this
before?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When an idea seems simultaneously novel and obvious, it&#39;s probably
a good one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seeing something obvious sounds easy. And yet empirically having
new ideas is hard. What&#39;s the source of this apparent contradiction?
It&#39;s that seeing the new idea usually requires you to change the
way you look at the world. We see the world through models that
both help and constrain us. When you fix a broken model, new ideas
become obvious. But noticing and fixing a broken model is hard.
That&#39;s how new ideas can be both obvious and yet hard to discover:
they&#39;re easy to see after you do something hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One way to discover broken models is to be stricter than other
people. Broken models of the world leave a trail of clues where
they bash against reality. Most people don&#39;t want to see these
clues. It would be an understatement to say that they&#39;re attached
to their current model; it&#39;s what they think in; so they&#39;ll tend
to ignore the trail of clues left by its breakage, however conspicuous
it may seem in retrospect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To find new ideas you have to seize on signs of breakage instead
of looking away. That&#39;s what Einstein did. He was able to see the
wild implications of Maxwell&#39;s equations not so much because he was
looking for new ideas as because he was stricter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other thing you need is a willingness to break rules. Paradoxical
as it sounds, if you want to fix your model of the world, it helps
to be the sort of person who&#39;s comfortable breaking rules. From the
point of view of the old model, which everyone including you initially
shares, the new model usually breaks at least implicit rules.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Few understand the degree of rule-breaking required, because new
ideas seem much more conservative once they succeed. They seem
perfectly reasonable once you&#39;re using the new model of the world
they brought with them. But they didn&#39;t at the time; it took the
greater part of a century for the heliocentric model to be generally
accepted, even among astronomers, because it felt so wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, if you think about it, a good new idea has to seem bad to
most people, or someone would have already explored it. So what
you&#39;re looking for is ideas that seem crazy, but the right kind of
crazy. How do you recognize these? You can&#39;t with certainty. Often
ideas that seem bad are bad. But ideas that are the right kind of
crazy tend to be exciting; they&#39;re rich in implications; whereas
ideas that are merely bad tend to be depressing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are two ways to be comfortable breaking rules: to enjoy
breaking them, and to be indifferent to them. I call these two cases
being aggressively and passively independent-minded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The aggressively independent-minded are the naughty ones. Rules
don&#39;t merely fail to stop them; breaking rules gives them additional
energy. For this sort of person, delight at the sheer audacity of
a project sometimes supplies enough activation energy to get it
started.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other way to break rules is not to care about them, or perhaps
even to know they exist. This is why novices and outsiders often
make new discoveries; their ignorance of a field&#39;s assumptions acts
as a source of temporary passive independent-mindedness. Aspies
also seem to have a kind of immunity to conventional beliefs.
Several I know say that this helps them to have new ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strictness plus rule-breaking sounds like a strange combination.
In popular culture they&#39;re opposed. But popular culture has a broken
model in this respect. It implicitly assumes that issues are trivial
ones, and in trivial matters strictness and rule-breaking &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt;
opposed. But in questions that really matter, only rule-breakers
can be truly strict.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An overlooked idea often doesn&#39;t lose till the semifinals. You do
see it, subconsciously, but then another part of your subconscious
shoots it down because it would be too weird, too risky, too much
work, too controversial. This suggests an exciting possibility: if
you could turn off such filters, you could see more new ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One way to do that is to ask what would be good ideas for &lt;i&gt;someone
else&lt;/i&gt; to explore. Then your subconscious won&#39;t shoot them down to
protect you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You could also discover overlooked ideas by working in the other
direction: by starting from what&#39;s obscuring them. Every cherished
but mistaken principle is surrounded by a dead zone of valuable
ideas that are unexplored because they contradict it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Religions are collections of cherished but mistaken principles. So
anything that can be described either literally or metaphorically
as a religion will have valuable unexplored ideas in its shadow.
Copernicus and Darwin both made discoveries of this type.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f18n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;18&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What are people in your field religious about, in the sense of being
too attached to some principle that might not be as self-evident
as they think? What becomes possible if you discard it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
People show much more originality in solving problems than in
deciding which problems to solve. Even the smartest can be surprisingly
conservative when deciding what to work on. People who&#39;d never dream
of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on
fashionable problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One reason people are more conservative when choosing problems than
solutions is that problems are bigger bets. A problem could occupy
you for years, while exploring a solution might only take days. But
even so I think most people are too conservative. They&#39;re not merely
responding to risk, but to fashion as well. Unfashionable problems
are undervalued.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the most interesting kinds of unfashionable problem is the
problem that people think has been fully explored, but hasn&#39;t.
Great work often takes something that already exists and shows its
latent potential. Durer and Watt both did this. So if you&#39;re
interested in a field that others think is tapped out, don&#39;t let
their skepticism deter you. People are often wrong about this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working on an unfashionable problem can be very pleasing. There&#39;s
no hype or hurry. Opportunists and critics are both occupied
elsewhere. The existing work often has an old-school solidity. And
there&#39;s a satisfying sense of economy in cultivating ideas that
would otherwise be wasted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the most common type of overlooked problem is not explicitly
unfashionable in the sense of being out of fashion. It just doesn&#39;t
seem to matter as much as it actually does. How do you find these?
By being self-indulgent — by letting your curiosity have its way,
and tuning out, at least temporarily, the little voice in your head
that says you should only be working on &quot;important&quot; problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You do need to work on important problems, but almost everyone is
too conservative about what counts as one. And if there&#39;s an important
but overlooked problem in your neighborhood, it&#39;s probably already
on your subconscious radar screen. So try asking yourself: if you
were going to take a break from &quot;serious&quot; work to work on something
just because it would be really interesting, what would you do? The
answer is probably more important than it seems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Originality in choosing problems seems to matter even more than
originality in solving them. That&#39;s what distinguishes the people
who discover whole new fields. So what might seem to be merely the
initial step — deciding what to work on — is in a sense the key
to the whole game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Few grasp this. One of the biggest misconceptions about new ideas
is about the ratio of question to answer in their composition.
People think big ideas are answers, but often the real insight was
in the question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part of the reason we underrate questions is the way they&#39;re used
in schools. In schools they tend to exist only briefly before being
answered, like unstable particles. But a really good question can
be much more than that. A really good question is a partial discovery.
How do new species arise? Is the force that makes objects fall to
earth the same as the one that keeps planets in their orbits? By
even asking such questions you were already in excitingly novel
territory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable things to carry around
with you. But the more you&#39;re carrying, the greater the chance of
noticing a solution — or perhaps even more excitingly, noticing
that two unanswered questions are the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes you carry a question for a long time. Great work often
comes from returning to a question you first noticed years before
— in your childhood, even — and couldn&#39;t stop thinking about.
People talk a lot about the importance of keeping your youthful
dreams alive, but it&#39;s just as important to keep your youthful
questions alive.

the popular picture of it. In the popular picture, experts are
certain. But actually the more puzzled you are, the better, so long
as (a) the things you&#39;re puzzled about matter, and (b) no one else
understands them either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Think about what&#39;s happening at the moment just before a new idea
is discovered. Often someone with sufficient expertise is puzzled
about something. Which means that originality consists partly of
puzzlement — of confusion! You have to be comfortable enough with
the world being full of puzzles that you&#39;re willing to see them,
but not so comfortable that you don&#39;t want to solve them.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f20n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;20&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s a great thing to be rich in unanswered questions. And this is
one of those situations where the rich get richer, because the best
way to acquire new questions is to try answering existing ones.
Questions don&#39;t just lead to answers, but also to more questions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The best questions grow in the answering. You notice a thread
protruding from the current paradigm and try pulling on it, and it
just gets longer and longer. So don&#39;t require a question to be
obviously big before you try answering it. You can rarely predict
that. It&#39;s hard enough even to notice the thread, let alone to
predict how much will unravel if you pull on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s better to be promiscuously curious — to pull a little bit on
a lot of threads, and see what happens. Big things start small. The
initial versions of big things were often just experiments, or side
projects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger. So start
lots of small things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being prolific is underrated. The more different things you try,
the greater the chance of discovering something new. Understand,
though, that trying lots of things will mean trying lots of things
that don&#39;t work. You can&#39;t have a lot of good ideas without also
having a lot of bad ones.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f21n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;21&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though it sounds more responsible to begin by studying everything
that&#39;s been done before, you&#39;ll learn faster and have more fun by
trying stuff. And you&#39;ll understand previous work better when you
do look at it. So err on the side of starting. Which is easier when
starting means starting small; those two ideas fit together like
two puzzle pieces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do you get from starting small to doing something great? By
making successive versions. Great things are almost always made in
successive versions. You start with something small and evolve it,
and the final version is both cleverer and more ambitious than
anything you could have planned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s particularly useful to make successive versions when you&#39;re
making something for people — to get an initial version in front
of them quickly, and then evolve it based on their response.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Begin by trying the simplest thing that could possibly work.
Surprisingly often, it does. If it doesn&#39;t, this will at least get
you started.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t try to cram too much new stuff into any one version. There
are names for doing this with the first version (taking too long
to ship) and the second (the second system effect), but these are
both merely instances of a more general principle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An early version of a new project will sometimes be dismissed as a
toy. It&#39;s a good sign when people do this. That means it has
everything a new idea needs except scale, and that tends to follow.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f22n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;22&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The alternative to starting with something small and evolving it
is to plan in advance what you&#39;re going to do. And planning does
usually seem the more responsible choice. It sounds more organized
to say &quot;we&#39;re going to do x and then y and then z&quot; than &quot;we&#39;re going
to try x and see what happens.&quot; And it is more &lt;i&gt;organized&lt;/i&gt;; it just
doesn&#39;t work as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Planning per se isn&#39;t good. It&#39;s sometimes necessary, but it&#39;s a
necessary evil — a response to unforgiving conditions. It&#39;s something
you have to do because you&#39;re working with inflexible media, or
because you need to coordinate the efforts of a lot of people. If
you keep projects small and use flexible media, you don&#39;t have to
plan as much, and your designs can evolve instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Take as much risk as you can afford. In an efficient market, risk
is proportionate to reward, so don&#39;t look for certainty, but for a
bet with high expected value. If you&#39;re not failing occasionally,
you&#39;re probably being too conservative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though conservatism is usually associated with the old, it&#39;s the
young who tend to make this mistake. Inexperience makes them fear
risk, but it&#39;s when you&#39;re young that you can afford the most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even a project that fails can be valuable. In the process of working
on it, you&#39;ll have crossed territory few others have seen, and
encountered questions few others have asked. And there&#39;s probably
no better source of questions than the ones you encounter in trying
to do something slightly too hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Use the advantages of youth when you have them, and the advantages
of age once you have those. The advantages of youth are energy,
time, optimism, and freedom. The advantages of age are knowledge,
efficiency, money, and power. With effort you can acquire some of
the latter when young and keep some of the former when old.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The old also have the advantage of knowing which advantages they
have. The young often have them without realizing it. The biggest
is probably time. The young have no idea how rich they are in time.
The best way to turn this time to advantage is to use it in slightly
frivolous ways: to learn about something you don&#39;t need to know
about, just out of curiosity, or to try building something just
because it would be cool, or to become freakishly good at something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That &quot;slightly&quot; is an important qualification. Spend time lavishly
when you&#39;re young, but don&#39;t simply waste it. There&#39;s a big difference
between doing something you worry might be a waste of time and doing
something you know for sure will be. The former is at least a bet,
and possibly a better one than you think.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f23n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;23&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most subtle advantage of youth, or more precisely of inexperience,
is that you&#39;re seeing everything with fresh eyes. When your brain
embraces an idea for the first time, sometimes the two don&#39;t fit
together perfectly. Usually the problem is with your brain, but
occasionally it&#39;s with the idea. A piece of it sticks out awkwardly
and jabs you when you think about it. People who are used to the
idea have learned to ignore it, but you have the opportunity not
to.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f24n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;24&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when you&#39;re learning about something for the first time, pay
attention to things that seem wrong or missing. You&#39;ll be tempted
to ignore them, since there&#39;s a 99% chance the problem is with you.
And you may have to set aside your misgivings temporarily to keep
progressing. But don&#39;t forget about them. When you&#39;ve gotten further
into the subject, come back and check if they&#39;re still there. If
they&#39;re still viable in the light of your present knowledge, they
probably represent an undiscovered idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One of the most valuable kinds of knowledge you get from experience
is to know what you &lt;i&gt;don&#39;t&lt;/i&gt; have to worry about. The young know all
the things that could matter, but not their relative importance.
So they worry equally about everything, when they should worry much
more about a few things and hardly at all about the rest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what you don&#39;t know is only half the problem with inexperience.
The other half is what you do know that ain&#39;t so. You arrive at
adulthood with your head full of nonsense — bad habits you&#39;ve
acquired and false things you&#39;ve been taught — and you won&#39;t be
able to do great work till you clear away at least the nonsense in
the way of whatever type of work you want to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much of the nonsense left in your head is left there by schools.
We&#39;re so used to schools that we unconsciously treat going to school
as identical with learning, but in fact schools have all sorts of
strange qualities that warp our ideas about learning and thinking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, schools induce passivity. Since you were a small child,
there was an authority at the front of the class telling all of you
what you had to learn and then measuring whether you did. But neither
classes nor tests are intrinsic to learning; they&#39;re just artifacts
of the way schools are usually designed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sooner you overcome this passivity, the better. If you&#39;re still
in school, try thinking of your education as your project, and your
teachers as working for you rather than vice versa. That may seem
a stretch, but it&#39;s not merely some weird thought experiment. It&#39;s
the truth economically, and in the best case it&#39;s the truth
intellectually as well. The best teachers don&#39;t want to be your
bosses. They&#39;d prefer it if you pushed ahead, using them as a source
of advice, rather than being pulled by them through the material.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Schools also give you a misleading impression of what work is like.
In school they tell you what the problems are, and they&#39;re almost
always soluble using no more than you&#39;ve been taught so far. In
real life you have to figure out what the problems are, and you
often don&#39;t know if they&#39;re soluble at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But perhaps the worst thing schools do to you is train you to win
by hacking the test. You can&#39;t do great work by doing that. You
can&#39;t trick God. So stop looking for that kind of shortcut. The way
to beat the system is to focus on problems and solutions that others
have overlooked, not to skimp on the work itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don&#39;t think of yourself as dependent on some gatekeeper giving you
a &quot;big break.&quot; Even if this were true, the best way to get it would
be to focus on doing good work rather than chasing influential
people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And don&#39;t take rejection by committees to heart. The qualities that
impress admissions officers and prize committees are quite different
from those required to do great work. The decisions of selection
committees are only meaningful to the extent that they&#39;re part of
a feedback loop, and very few are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
People new to a field will often copy existing work. There&#39;s nothing
inherently bad about that. There&#39;s no better way to learn how
something works than by trying to reproduce it. Nor does
copying necessarily make your work unoriginal. Originality is the
presence of new ideas, not the absence of old ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s a good way to copy and a bad way. If you&#39;re going to copy
something, do it openly instead of furtively, or worse still,
unconsciously. This is what&#39;s meant by the famously misattributed
phrase &quot;Great artists steal.&quot; The really dangerous kind of copying,
the kind that gives copying a bad name, is the kind that&#39;s done
without realizing it, because you&#39;re nothing more than a train
running on tracks laid down by someone else. But at the other
extreme, copying can be a sign of superiority rather than subordination.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f25n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;25&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In many fields it&#39;s almost inevitable that your early work will be
in some sense based on other people&#39;s. Projects rarely arise in a
vacuum. They&#39;re usually a reaction to previous work. When you&#39;re
first starting out, you don&#39;t have any previous work; if you&#39;re
going to react to something, it has to be someone else&#39;s. Once
you&#39;re established, you can react to your own. But while the former
gets called derivative and the latter doesn&#39;t, structurally the two
cases are more similar than they seem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oddly enough, the very novelty of the most novel ideas sometimes
makes them seem at first to be more derivative than they are. New
discoveries often have to be conceived initially as variations of
existing things, &lt;i&gt;even by their discoverers&lt;/i&gt;, because there isn&#39;t
yet the conceptual vocabulary to express them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are definitely some dangers to copying, though. One is that
you&#39;ll tend to copy old things — things that were in their day at
the frontier of knowledge, but no longer are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And when you do copy something, don&#39;t copy every feature of it.
Some will make you ridiculous if you do. Don&#39;t copy the manner of
an eminent 50 year old professor if you&#39;re 18, for example, or the
idiom of a Renaissance poem hundreds of years later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of the features of things you admire are flaws they succeeded
despite. Indeed, the features that are easiest to imitate are the
most likely to be the flaws.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is particularly true for behavior. Some talented people are
jerks, and this sometimes makes it seem to the inexperienced that
being a jerk is part of being talented. It isn&#39;t; being talented
is merely how they get away with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to copy something from
one field into another. History is so full of chance discoveries
of this type that it&#39;s probably worth giving chance a hand by
deliberately learning about other kinds of work. You can take ideas
from quite distant fields if you let them be metaphors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Negative examples can be as inspiring as positive ones. In fact you
can sometimes learn more from things done badly than from things
done well; sometimes it only becomes clear what&#39;s needed when it&#39;s
missing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If a lot of the best people in your field are collected in one
place, it&#39;s usually a good idea to visit for a while. It will
increase your ambition, and also, by showing you that these people
are human, increase your self-confidence.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f26n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;26&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&#39;re earnest you&#39;ll probably get a warmer welcome than you
might expect. Most people who are very good at something are happy
to talk about it with anyone who&#39;s genuinely interested. If they&#39;re
really good at their work, then they probably have a hobbyist&#39;s
interest in it, and hobbyists always want to talk about their
hobbies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It may take some effort to find the people who are really good,
though. Doing great work has such prestige that in some places,
particularly universities, there&#39;s a polite fiction that everyone
is engaged in it. And that is far from true. People within universities
can&#39;t say so openly, but the quality of the work being done in
different departments varies immensely. Some departments have people
doing great work; others have in the past; others never have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Seek out the best colleagues. There are a lot of projects that can&#39;t
be done alone, and even if you&#39;re working on one that can be, it&#39;s
good to have other people to encourage you and to bounce ideas off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colleagues don&#39;t just affect your work, though; they also affect
you. So work with people you want to become like, because you will.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quality is more important than quantity in colleagues. It&#39;s better
to have one or two great ones than a building full of pretty good
ones. In fact it&#39;s not merely better, but necessary, judging from
history: the degree to which great work happens in clusters suggests
that one&#39;s colleagues often make the difference between doing great
work and not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do you know when you have sufficiently good colleagues? In my
experience, when you do, you know. Which means if you&#39;re unsure,
you probably don&#39;t. But it may be possible to give a more concrete
answer than that. Here&#39;s an attempt: sufficiently good colleagues
offer &lt;i&gt;surprising&lt;/i&gt; insights. They can see and do things that you
can&#39;t. So if you have a handful of colleagues good enough to keep
you on your toes in this sense, you&#39;re probably over the threshold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of us can benefit from collaborating with colleagues, but some
projects require people on a larger scale, and starting one of those
is not for everyone. If you want to run a project like that, you&#39;ll
have to become a manager, and managing well takes aptitude and
interest like any other kind of work. If you don&#39;t have them, there
is no middle path: you must either force yourself to learn management
as a second language, or avoid such projects.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f27n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;27&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Husband your morale. It&#39;s the basis of everything when you&#39;re working
on ambitious projects. You have to nurture and protect it like a
living organism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Morale starts with your view of life. You&#39;re more likely to do great
work if you&#39;re an optimist, and more likely to if you think of
yourself as lucky than if you think of yourself as a victim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, work can to some extent protect you from your problems. If
you choose work that&#39;s pure, its very difficulties will serve as a
refuge from the difficulties of everyday life. If this is escapism,
it&#39;s a very productive form of it, and one that has been used by
some of the greatest minds in history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Morale compounds via work: high morale helps you do good work, which
increases your morale and helps you do even better work. But this
cycle also operates in the other direction: if you&#39;re not doing
good work, that can demoralize you and make it even harder to. Since
it matters so much for this cycle to be running in the right
direction, it can be a good idea to switch to easier work when
you&#39;re stuck, just so you start to get something done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the biggest mistakes ambitious people make is to allow
setbacks to destroy their morale all at once, like a balloon bursting.
You can inoculate yourself against this by explicitly considering
setbacks a part of your process. Solving hard problems always
involves some backtracking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is the
desire to. So &quot;If at first you don&#39;t succeed, try, try again&quot; isn&#39;t
quite right. It should be: If at first you don&#39;t succeed, either
try again, or backtrack and then try again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Never give up&quot; is also not quite right. Obviously there are times
when it&#39;s the right choice to eject. A more precise version would
be: Never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than you
need to. Corollary: Never abandon the root node.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s not necessarily a bad sign if work is a struggle, any more
than it&#39;s a bad sign to be out of breath while running. It depends
how fast you&#39;re running. So learn to distinguish good pain from
bad. Good pain is a sign of effort; bad pain is a sign of damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An audience is a critical component of morale. If you&#39;re a scholar,
your audience may be your peers; in the arts, it may be an audience
in the traditional sense. Either way it doesn&#39;t need to be big.
The value of an audience doesn&#39;t grow anything like linearly with
its size. Which is bad news if you&#39;re famous, but good news if
you&#39;re just starting out, because it means a small but dedicated
audience can be enough to sustain you. If a handful of people
genuinely love what you&#39;re doing, that&#39;s enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To the extent you can, avoid letting intermediaries come between
you and your audience. In some types of work this is inevitable,
but it&#39;s so liberating to escape it that you might be better off
switching to an adjacent type if that will let you go direct.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f28n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;28&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The people you spend time with will also have a big effect on your
morale. You&#39;ll find there are some who increase your energy and
others who decrease it, and the effect someone has is not always
what you&#39;d expect. Seek out the people who increase your energy and
avoid those who decrease it. Though of course if there&#39;s someone
you need to take care of, that takes precedence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t marry someone who doesn&#39;t understand that you need to work,
or sees your work as competition for your attention. If you&#39;re
ambitious, you need to work; it&#39;s almost like a medical condition;
so someone who won&#39;t let you work either doesn&#39;t understand you,
or does and doesn&#39;t care.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ultimately morale is physical. You think with your body, so it&#39;s
important to take care of it. That means exercising regularly,
eating and sleeping well, and avoiding the more dangerous kinds of
drugs. Running and walking are particularly good forms of exercise
because they&#39;re good for thinking.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f29n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;29&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People who do great work are not necessarily happier than everyone
else, but they&#39;re happier than they&#39;d be if they didn&#39;t. In fact,
if you&#39;re smart and ambitious, it&#39;s dangerous &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to be productive.
People who are smart and ambitious but don&#39;t achieve much tend to
become bitter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It&#39;s ok to want to impress other people, but choose the right people.
The opinion of people you respect is signal. Fame, which is the
opinion of a much larger group you might or might not respect, just
adds noise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The prestige of a type of work is at best a trailing indicator and
sometimes completely mistaken. If you do anything well enough,
you&#39;ll make it prestigious. So the question to ask about a type of
work is not how much prestige it has, but how well it could be done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Competition can be an effective motivator, but don&#39;t let it choose
the problem for you; don&#39;t let yourself get drawn into chasing
something just because others are. In fact, don&#39;t let competitors
make you do anything much more specific than work harder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Curiosity is the best guide. Your curiosity never lies, and it knows
more than you do about what&#39;s worth paying attention to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Notice how often that word has come up. If you asked an oracle the
secret to doing great work and the oracle replied with a single
word, my bet would be on &quot;curiosity.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That doesn&#39;t translate directly to advice. It&#39;s not enough just to
be curious, and you can&#39;t command curiosity anyway. But you can
nurture it and let it drive you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will
choose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to
notice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them. The whole
process is a kind of dance with curiosity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Believe it or not, I tried to make this essay as short as I could.
But its length at least means it acts as a filter. If you made it
this far, you must be interested in doing great work. And if so
you&#39;re already further along than you might realize, because the
set of people willing to want to is small.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The factors in doing great work are factors in the literal,
mathematical sense, and they are: ability, interest, effort, and
luck. Luck by definition you can&#39;t do anything about, so we can
ignore that. And we can assume effort, if you do in fact want to
do great work. So the problem boils down to ability and interest.
Can you find a kind of work where your ability and interest will
combine to yield an explosion of new ideas?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here there are grounds for optimism. There are so many different
ways to do great work, and even more that are still undiscovered.
Out of all those different types of work, the one you&#39;re most suited
for is probably a pretty close match. Probably a comically close
match. It&#39;s just a question of finding it, and how far into it your
ability and interest can take you. And you can only answer that by
trying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many more people could try to do great work than do. What holds
them back is a combination of modesty and fear. It seems presumptuous
to try to be Newton or Shakespeare. It also seems hard; surely if
you tried something like that, you&#39;d fail. Presumably the calculation
is rarely explicit. Few people consciously decide not to try to do
great work. But that&#39;s what&#39;s going on subconsciously; they shy
away from the question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I&#39;m going to pull a sneaky trick on you. Do you want to do great
work, or not? Now you have to decide consciously. Sorry about that.
I wouldn&#39;t have done it to a general audience. But we already know
you&#39;re interested.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t worry about being presumptuous. You don&#39;t have to tell anyone.
And if it&#39;s too hard and you fail, so what? Lots of people have
worse problems than that. In fact you&#39;ll be lucky if it&#39;s the worst
problem you have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, you&#39;ll have to work hard. But again, lots of people have to
work hard. And if you&#39;re working on something you find very
interesting, which you necessarily will if you&#39;re on the right path,
the work will probably feel less burdensome than a lot of your
peers&#39;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The discoveries are out there, waiting to be made. Why not by you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I don&#39;t think you could give a precise definition of what
counts as great work. Doing great work means doing something important
so well that you expand people&#39;s ideas of what&#39;s possible. But
there&#39;s no threshold for importance. It&#39;s a matter of degree, and
often hard to judge at the time anyway. So I&#39;d rather people focused
on developing their interests rather than worrying about whether
they&#39;re important or not. Just try to do something amazing, and
leave it to future generations to say if you succeeded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
A lot of standup comedy is based on noticing anomalies in
everyday life. &quot;Did you ever notice...?&quot; New ideas come from doing
this about nontrivial things. Which may help explain why people&#39;s
reaction to a new idea is often the first half of laughing: Ha!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
That second qualifier is critical. If you&#39;re excited about
something most authorities discount, but you can&#39;t give a more
precise explanation than &quot;they don&#39;t get it,&quot; then you&#39;re starting
to drift into the territory of cranks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Finding something to work on is not simply a matter of finding
a match between the current version of you and a list of known
problems. You&#39;ll often have to coevolve with the problem. That&#39;s
why it can sometimes be so hard to figure out what to work on. The
search space is huge. It&#39;s the cartesian product of all possible
types of work, both known and yet to be discovered, and all possible
future versions of you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s no way you could search this whole space, so you have to
rely on heuristics to generate promising paths through it and hope
the best matches will be clustered. Which they will not always be;
different types of work have been collected together as much by
accidents of history as by the intrinsic similarities between them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
There are many reasons curious people are more likely to do
great work, but one of the more subtle is that, by casting a wide
net, they&#39;re more likely to find the right thing to work on in the
first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f6n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
It can also be dangerous to make things for an audience you
feel is less sophisticated than you, if that causes you to talk
down to them. You can make a lot of money doing that, if you do it
in a sufficiently cynical way, but it&#39;s not the route to great work.
Not that anyone using this m.o. would care.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f7n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
This idea I learned from Hardy&#39;s &lt;i&gt;A Mathematician&#39;s Apology&lt;/i&gt;,
which I recommend to anyone ambitious to do great work, in any
field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f8n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Just as we overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate
what we can do over several years, we overestimate the damage done
by procrastinating for a day and underestimate the damage done by
procrastinating for several years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f9n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
You can&#39;t usually get paid for doing exactly what you want,
especially early on. There are two options: get paid for doing work
close to what you want and hope to push it closer, or get paid for
doing something else entirely and do your own projects on the side.
Both can work, but both have drawbacks: in the first approach your
work is compromised by default, and in the second you have to fight
to get time to do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f10n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;10&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
If you set your life up right, it will deliver the focus-relax
cycle automatically. The perfect setup is an office you work in and
that you walk to and from.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f11n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;11&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
There may be some very unworldly people who do great work
without consciously trying to. If you want to expand this rule to
cover that case, it becomes: Don&#39;t try to be anything except the
best.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f12n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;12&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
This gets more complicated in work like acting, where the
goal is to adopt a fake persona. But even here it&#39;s possible to be
affected. Perhaps the rule in such fields should be to avoid
&lt;i&gt;unintentional&lt;/i&gt; affectation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f13n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;13&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
It&#39;s safe to have beliefs that you treat as unquestionable
if and only if they&#39;re also unfalsifiable. For example, it&#39;s safe
to have the principle that everyone should be treated equally under
the law, because a sentence with a &quot;should&quot; in it isn&#39;t really a
statement about the world and is therefore hard to disprove. And
if there&#39;s no evidence that could disprove one of your principles,
there can&#39;t be any facts you&#39;d need to ignore in order to preserve
it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f14n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;14&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Affectation is easier to cure than intellectual dishonesty.
Affectation is often a shortcoming of the young that burns off in
time, while intellectual dishonesty is more of a character flaw.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f15n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;15&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Obviously you don&#39;t have to be working at the exact moment
you have the idea, but you&#39;ll probably have been working fairly
recently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f16n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;16&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Some say psychoactive drugs have a similar effect. I&#39;m
skeptical, but also almost totally ignorant of their effects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f17n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;17&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
For example you might give the nth most important topic
(m-1)/m^n of your attention, for some m &amp;gt; 1. You couldn&#39;t allocate
your attention so precisely, of course, but this at least gives an
idea of a reasonable distribution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f18n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;18&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The principles defining a religion have to be mistaken.
Otherwise anyone might adopt them, and there would be nothing to
distinguish the adherents of the religion from everyone else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f19n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;19&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
It might be a good exercise to try writing down a list of
questions you wondered about in your youth. You might find you&#39;re
now in a position to do something about some of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f20n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;20&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The connection between originality and uncertainty causes a
strange phenomenon: because the conventional-minded are more certain
than the independent-minded, this tends to give them the upper hand
in disputes, even though they&#39;re generally stupider.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
   The best lack all conviction, while the worst&lt;br&gt;
   Are full of passionate intensity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[&lt;a name=&quot;f21n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;21&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Derived from Linus Pauling&#39;s &quot;If you want to have good ideas,
you must have many ideas.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f22n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;22&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Attacking a project as a &quot;toy&quot; is similar to attacking a
statement as &quot;inappropriate.&quot; It means that no more substantial
criticism can be made to stick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f23n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;23&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
One way to tell whether you&#39;re wasting time is to ask if
you&#39;re producing or consuming. Writing computer games is less likely
to be a waste of time than playing them, and playing games where
you create something is less likely to be a waste of time than
playing games where you don&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f24n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;24&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Another related advantage is that if you haven&#39;t said anything
publicly yet, you won&#39;t be biased toward evidence that supports
your earlier conclusions. With sufficient integrity you could achieve
eternal youth in this respect, but few manage to. For most people,
having previously published opinions has an effect similar to
ideology, just in quantity 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f25n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;25&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
In the early 1630s Daniel Mytens made a painting of Henrietta
Maria handing a laurel wreath to Charles I. Van Dyck then painted
his own version to show how much better he was.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f26n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;26&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I&#39;m being deliberately vague about what a place is. As of
this writing, being in the same physical place has advantages that
are hard to duplicate, but that could change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f27n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;27&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
This is false when the work the other people have to do is
very constrained, as with SETI@home or Bitcoin. It may be possible
to expand the area in which it&#39;s false by defining similarly
restricted protocols with more freedom of action in the nodes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f28n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;28&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Corollary: Building something that enables people to go around
intermediaries and engage directly with their audience is probably
a good idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f29n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;29&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
It may be helpful always to walk or run the same route, because
that frees attention for thinking. It feels that way to me, and
there is some historical evidence for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;888888&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt;

questions based on them, then asked it where good ideas come from.  The
answer was ok, but not what I would have said. This is what I would have said.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The way to get new ideas is to notice anomalies: what seems strange,
or missing, or broken? You can see anomalies in everyday life (much
of standup comedy is based on this), but the best place to look for
them is at the frontiers of knowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knowledge grows fractally.
From a distance its edges look smooth, but when you learn enough
to get close to one, you&#39;ll notice it&#39;s full of gaps. These gaps
will seem obvious; it will seem inexplicable that no one has tried
x or wondered about y. In the best case, exploring such gaps yields
whole new fractal buds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><link>http://paulgraham.com/getideas.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://paulgraham.com/getideas.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Need to Read</title><description>November 2022&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the science fiction books I read as a kid, reading had often
been replaced by some more efficient way of acquiring knowledge.
Mysterious &quot;tapes&quot; would load it into one&#39;s brain like a program
being loaded into a computer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That sort of thing is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Not just
because it would be hard to build a replacement for reading, but
because even if one existed, it would be insufficient. Reading about
x doesn&#39;t just teach you about x; it also teaches you how to write.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/read.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would that matter? If we replaced reading, would anyone need to be
good at writing?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason it would matter is that writing is not just a way to
convey ideas, but also a way to have them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A good writer doesn&#39;t just think, and then write down what he
thought, as a sort of transcript. A good writer will almost always
discover new things in the process of writing. And there is, as far
as I know, no substitute for this kind of discovery. Talking about
your ideas with other people is a good way to develop them. But
even after doing this, you&#39;ll find you still discover new things
when you sit down to write. There is a kind of thinking that can
only be done by &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/words.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;writing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are of course kinds of thinking that can be done without
writing. If you don&#39;t need to go too deeply into a problem, you can
solve it without writing. If you&#39;re thinking about how two pieces
of machinery should fit together, writing about it probably won&#39;t
help much. And when a problem can be described formally, you can
sometimes solve it in your head. But if you need to solve a
complicated, ill-defined problem, it will almost always help to
write about it. Which in turn means that someone who&#39;s not good at
writing will almost always be at a disadvantage in solving such
problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can&#39;t think well without writing well, and you can&#39;t write well
without reading well. And I mean that last &quot;well&quot; in both senses.
You have to be good at reading, and read good things.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/read.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People who just want information may find other ways to get it.
But people who want to have ideas can&#39;t afford to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Audiobooks can give you examples of good writing, but having
them read to you doesn&#39;t teach you as much about writing as reading
them yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
By &quot;good at reading&quot; I don&#39;t mean good at the mechanics of
reading. You don&#39;t have to be good at extracting words from the
page so much as extracting meaning from the words.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><link>http://paulgraham.com/read.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://paulgraham.com/read.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What You (Want to)* Want</title><description>November 2022&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since I was about 9 I&#39;ve been puzzled by the apparent contradiction
between being made of matter that behaves in a predictable way, and
the feeling that I could choose to do whatever I wanted. At the
time I had a self-interested motive for exploring the question. At
that age (like most succeeding ages) I was always in trouble with
the authorities, and it seemed to me that there might possibly be
some way to get out of trouble by arguing that I wasn&#39;t responsible
for my actions. I gradually lost hope of that, but the puzzle
remained: How do you reconcile being a machine made of matter with
the feeling that you&#39;re free to choose what you do?
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/want.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best way to explain the answer may be to start with a slightly
wrong version, and then fix it. The wrong version is: You can do
what you want, but you can&#39;t want what you want. Yes, you can control
what you do, but you&#39;ll do what you want, and you can&#39;t control
that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason this is mistaken is that people do sometimes change what
they want. People who don&#39;t want to want something — drug addicts,
for example — can sometimes make themselves stop wanting it. And
people who want to want something — who want to like classical
music, or broccoli — sometimes succeed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So we modify our initial statement: You can do what you want, but
you can&#39;t want to want what you want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s still not quite true. It&#39;s possible to change what you want
to want. I can imagine someone saying &quot;I decided to stop wanting
to like classical music.&quot; But we&#39;re getting closer to the truth.
It&#39;s rare for people to change what they want to want, and the more
&quot;want to&quot;s we add, the rarer it gets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We can get arbitrarily close to a true statement by adding more &quot;want
to&quot;s in much the same way we can get arbitrarily close to 1 by adding
more 9s to a string of 9s following a decimal point. In practice
three or four &quot;want to&quot;s must surely be enough. It&#39;s hard even to
envision what it would mean to change what you want to want to want
to want, let alone actually do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So one way to express the correct answer is to use a regular
expression. You can do what you want, but there&#39;s some statement
of the form &quot;you can&#39;t (want to)* want what you want&quot; that&#39;s true.
Ultimately you get back to a want that you don&#39;t control.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/want.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I didn&#39;t know when I was 9 that matter might behave randomly,
but I don&#39;t think it affects the problem much. Randomness destroys
the ghost in the machine as effectively as determinism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
If you don&#39;t like using an expression, you can make the same
point using higher-order desires: There is some n such that you
don&#39;t control your nth-order desires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

would be the same, because they&#39;re true by definition. Ditto for
the truths of physics; the mass of a carbon atom would be the same
on their planet. But I think we&#39;d share other truths with aliens
besides the truths of math and physics, and that it would be
worthwhile to think about what these might be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, I think we&#39;d share the principle that a controlled
experiment testing some hypothesis entitles us to have proportionally
increased belief in it. It seems fairly likely, too, that it would
be true for aliens that one can get better at something by practicing.
We&#39;d probably share Occam&#39;s razor. There doesn&#39;t seem anything
specifically human about any of these ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We can only guess, of course. We can&#39;t say for sure what forms
intelligent life might take. Nor is it my goal here to explore that
question, interesting though it is. The point of the idea of alien
truth is not that it gives us a way to speculate about what forms
intelligent life might take, but that it gives us a threshold, or
more precisely a target, for truth. If you&#39;re trying to find the
most general truths short of those of math or physics, then presumably
they&#39;ll be those we&#39;d share in common with other forms of intelligent
life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alien truth will work best as a heuristic if we err on the side of
generosity. If an idea might plausibly be relevant to aliens, that&#39;s
enough. Justice, for example. I wouldn&#39;t want to bet that all
intelligent beings would understand the concept of justice, but I
wouldn&#39;t want to bet against it either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The idea of alien truth is related to Erdos&#39;s idea of God&#39;s book.
He used to describe a particularly good proof as being in God&#39;s
book, the implication being (a) that a sufficiently good proof was
more discovered than invented, and (b) that its goodness would be
universally recognized. If there&#39;s such a thing as alien truth,
then there&#39;s more in God&#39;s book than math.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What should we call the search for alien truth? The obvious choice
is &quot;philosophy.&quot; Whatever else philosophy includes, it should
probably include this. I&#39;m fairly sure Aristotle would have thought
so. One could even make the case that the search for alien truth
is, if not an accurate description &lt;i&gt;of&lt;/i&gt; philosophy, a good
definition &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; it. I.e. that it&#39;s what people who call
themselves philosophers should be doing, whether or not they currently
are. But I&#39;m not wedded to that; doing it is what matters, not what
we call it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We may one day have something like alien life among us in the form
of AIs. And that may in turn allow us to be precise about what
truths an intelligent being would have to share with us. We might
find, for example, that it&#39;s impossible to create something we&#39;d
consider intelligent that doesn&#39;t use Occam&#39;s razor. We might one
day even be able to prove that. But though this sort of research
would be very interesting, it&#39;s not necessary for our purposes, or
even the same field; the goal of philosophy, if we&#39;re going to call it that, would be
to see what ideas we come up with using alien truth as a target,
not to say precisely where the threshold of it is. Those two questions might one
day converge, but they&#39;ll converge from quite different directions,
and till they do, it would be too constraining to restrict ourselves
to thinking only about things we&#39;re certain would be alien truths.
Especially since this will probably be one of those areas where the
best guesses turn out to be surprisingly close to optimal. (Let&#39;s
see if that one does.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whatever we call it, the attempt to discover alien truths would be
a worthwhile undertaking. And curiously enough, that is itself
probably an alien truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;888888&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Trevor Blackwell, Greg Brockman,

could give for getting in, per word, was 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Explain what you&#39;ve learned from users.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That tests a lot of things: whether you&#39;re paying attention to
users, how well you understand them, and even how much they need
what you&#39;re making.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Afterward I asked myself the same question. What have I learned
from YC&#39;s users, the startups we&#39;ve funded?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first thing that came to mind was that most startups have the
same problems. No two have exactly the same problems, but it&#39;s
surprising how much the problems remain the same, regardless of
what they&#39;re making. Once you&#39;ve advised 100 startups all doing
different things, you rarely encounter problems you haven&#39;t seen
before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This fact is one of the things that makes YC work. But I didn&#39;t
know it when we started YC. I only had a few data points: our own
startup, and those started by friends. It was a surprise to me how
often the same problems recur in different forms. Many later stage
investors might never realize this, because later stage investors
might not advise 100 startups in their whole career, but a YC partner
will get this much experience in the first year or two.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s one advantage of funding large numbers of early stage companies
rather than smaller numbers of later-stage ones. You get a lot of
data. Not just because you&#39;re looking at more companies, but also
because more goes wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But knowing (nearly) all the problems startups can encounter doesn&#39;t
mean that advising them can be automated, or reduced to a formula.
There&#39;s no substitute for individual office hours with a YC partner.
Each startup is unique, which means they have to be advised
by specific partners who know them well.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/users.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We learned that the hard way, in the notorious &quot;batch that broke
YC&quot; in the summer of 2012. Up till that point we treated the partners
as a pool. When a startup requested office hours, they got the next
available slot posted by any partner. That meant every partner had
to know every startup. This worked fine up to 60 startups, but when
the batch grew to 80, everything broke. The founders probably didn&#39;t
realize anything was wrong, but the partners were confused and
unhappy because halfway through the batch they still didn&#39;t know
all the companies yet.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/users.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first I was puzzled. How could things be fine at 60 startups and
broken at 80? It was only a third more. Then I realized what had
happened. We were using an &lt;i&gt;O(n&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/i&gt; algorithm. So of course it blew
up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The solution we adopted was the classic one in these situations.
We sharded the batch into smaller groups of startups, each overseen
by a dedicated group of partners. That fixed the problem, and has
worked fine ever since. But the batch that broke YC was a powerful
demonstration of how individualized the process of advising startups
has to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another related surprise is how bad founders can be at realizing
what their problems are. Founders will sometimes come in to talk
about some problem, and we&#39;ll discover another much bigger one in
the course of the conversation. For example (and this case is all
too common), founders will come in to talk about the difficulties
they&#39;re having raising money, and after digging into their situation,
it turns out the reason is that the company is doing badly, and
investors can tell. Or founders will come in worried that they still
haven&#39;t cracked the problem of user acquisition, and the reason turns out
to be that their product isn&#39;t good enough. There have been times
when I&#39;ve asked &quot;Would you use this yourself, if you hadn&#39;t built
it?&quot; and the founders, on thinking about it, said &quot;No.&quot; Well, there&#39;s
the reason you&#39;re having trouble getting users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Often founders know what their problems are, but not their relative
importance.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/users.html#f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
They&#39;ll come in to talk about three problems
they&#39;re worrying about. One is of moderate importance, one doesn&#39;t
matter at all, and one will kill the company if it isn&#39;t addressed
immediately. It&#39;s like watching one of those horror movies where
the heroine is deeply upset that her boyfriend cheated on her, and
only mildly curious about the door that&#39;s mysteriously ajar. You
want to say: never mind about your boyfriend, think about that door!
Fortunately in office hours you can. So while startups still die
with some regularity, it&#39;s rarely because they wandered into a room
containing a murderer. The YC partners can warn them where the
murderers are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not that founders listen. That was another big surprise: how often
founders don&#39;t listen to us. A couple weeks ago I talked to a partner
who had been working for YC for a couple batches and was starting
to see the pattern. &quot;They come back a year later,&quot; she said, &quot;and
say &#39;We wish we&#39;d listened to you.&#39;&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It took me a long time to figure out why founders don&#39;t listen. At
first I thought it was mere stubbornness. That&#39;s part of the reason,
but another and probably more important reason is that so much about
startups is &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/before.html&quot;&gt;counterintuitive&lt;/a&gt;. 
And when you tell someone something
counterintuitive, what it sounds to them is wrong. So the reason
founders don&#39;t listen to us is that they don&#39;t &lt;i&gt;believe&lt;/i&gt; us. At
least not till experience teaches them otherwise.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/users.html#f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason startups are so counterintuitive is that they&#39;re so
different from most people&#39;s other experiences. No one knows what
it&#39;s like except those who&#39;ve done it. Which is why YC partners
should usually have been founders themselves. But strangely enough,
the counterintuitiveness of startups turns out to be another of the
things that make YC work. If it weren&#39;t counterintuitive, founders
wouldn&#39;t need our advice about how to do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Focus is doubly important for early stage startups, because not
only do they have a hundred different problems, they don&#39;t have
anyone to work on them except the founders. If the founders focus
on things that don&#39;t matter, there&#39;s no one focusing on the things
that do. So the essence of what happens at YC is to figure out which
problems matter most, then cook up ideas for solving them — ideally
at a resolution of a week or less — and then try those ideas and
measure how well they worked. The focus is on action, with measurable,
near-term results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This doesn&#39;t imply that founders should rush forward regardless of
the consequences. If you correct course at a high enough frequency,
you can be simultaneously decisive at a micro scale and tentative
at a macro scale. The result is a somewhat winding path, but executed
very rapidly, like the path a running back takes downfield. And in
practice there&#39;s less backtracking than you might expect. Founders
usually guess right about which direction to run in, especially if
they have someone experienced like a YC partner to bounce their
hypotheses off. And when they guess wrong, they notice fast, because
they&#39;ll talk about the results at office hours the next week.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/users.html#f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A small improvement in navigational ability can make you a lot
faster, because it has a double effect: the path is shorter, and
you can travel faster along it when you&#39;re more certain it&#39;s the
right one. That&#39;s where a lot of YC&#39;s value lies, in helping founders
get an extra increment of focus that lets them move faster. And
since moving fast is the essence of a startup, YC in effect makes
startups more startup-like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speed defines startups. Focus enables speed. YC improves focus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why are founders uncertain about what to do? Partly because startups
almost by definition are doing something new, which means no one
knows how to do it yet, or in most cases even what &quot;it&quot; is. Partly
because startups are so counterintuitive generally. And partly
because many founders, especially young and ambitious ones, have
been trained to win the wrong way. That took me years to figure
out. The educational system in most countries trains you to win by
&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html&quot;&gt;hacking the test&lt;/a&gt; 
instead of actually doing whatever it&#39;s supposed
to measure. But that stops working when you start a startup. So
part of what YC does is to retrain founders to stop trying to hack
the test. (It takes a surprisingly long time. A year in, you still
see them reverting to their old habits.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;YC is not simply more experienced founders passing on their knowledge.
It&#39;s more like specialization than apprenticeship. The knowledge
of the YC partners and the founders have different shapes: It
wouldn&#39;t be worthwhile for a founder to acquire the encyclopedic
knowledge of startup problems that a YC partner has, just as it
wouldn&#39;t be worthwhile for a YC partner to acquire the depth of
domain knowledge that a founder has. That&#39;s why it can still be
valuable for an experienced founder to do YC, just as it can still
be valuable for an experienced athlete to have a coach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other big thing YC gives founders is colleagues, and this may
be even more important than the advice of partners. If you look at
history, great work clusters around certain places and institutions:
Florence in the late 15th century, the University of G�ttingen in
the late 19th, &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; under Ross, Bell Labs, Xerox PARC.
However good you are, good colleagues make you better. Indeed, very
ambitious people probably need colleagues more than anyone else,
because they&#39;re so starved for them in everyday life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether or not YC manages one day to be listed alongside those
famous clusters, it won&#39;t be for lack of trying. We were very aware
of this historical phenomenon and deliberately designed YC to be
one. By this point it&#39;s not bragging to say that it&#39;s the biggest
cluster of great startup founders. Even people trying to attack YC
concede that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colleagues and startup founders are two of the most powerful forces
in the world, so you&#39;d expect it to have a big effect to combine
them. Before YC, to the extent people thought about the question
at all, most assumed they couldn&#39;t be combined — that loneliness
was the price of independence. That was how it felt to us when we
started our own startup in Boston in the 1990s. We had a handful
of older people we could go to for advice (of varying quality), but
no peers. There was no one we could commiserate with about the
misbehavior of investors, or speculate with about the future of
technology. I often tell founders to make something they themselves
want, and YC is certainly that: it was designed to be exactly what
we wanted when we were starting a startup.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing we wanted was to be able to get seed funding without
having to make the rounds of random rich people. That has become a
commodity now, at least in the US. But great colleagues can never
become a commodity, because the fact that they cluster in some
places means they&#39;re proportionally absent from the rest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something magical happens where they do cluster though. The energy
in the room at a YC dinner is like nothing else I&#39;ve experienced.
We would have been happy just to have one or two other startups to
talk to. When you have a whole roomful it&#39;s another thing entirely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;YC founders aren&#39;t just inspired by one another. They also help one
another. That&#39;s the happiest thing I&#39;ve learned about startup
founders: how generous they can be in helping one another. We noticed
this in the first batch and consciously designed YC to magnify it.
The result is something far more intense than, say, a university.
Between the partners, the alumni, and their batchmates, founders
are surrounded by people who want to help them, and can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] 
This is why I&#39;ve never liked it when people refer to YC as a
&quot;bootcamp.&quot; It&#39;s intense like a bootcamp, but the opposite in
structure. Instead of everyone doing the same thing, they&#39;re each
talking to YC partners to figure out what their specific startup
needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] 
When I say the summer 2012 batch was broken, I mean it felt
to the partners that something was wrong. Things weren&#39;t yet so
broken that the startups had a worse experience. In fact that batch
did unusually well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] 
This situation reminds me of the research showing that people
are much better at answering questions than they are at judging how
accurate their answers are. The two phenomena feel very similar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] 
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/airbnbs.html&quot;&gt;Airbnbs&lt;/a&gt; were 
particularly good at listening — partly
because they were flexible and disciplined, but also because they&#39;d
had such a rough time during the preceding year. They were ready
to listen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] 
The optimal unit of decisiveness depends on how long it takes
to get results, and that depends on the type of problem you&#39;re
solving. When you&#39;re negotiating with investors, it could be a
couple days, whereas if you&#39;re building hardware it could be months.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

the rebirth of the concept of heresy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his excellent biography of Newton, Richard Westfall writes about the
moment when he was elected a fellow of Trinity College:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Supported comfortably, Newton was free to devote himself wholly
  to whatever he chose. To remain on, he had only to avoid the three
  unforgivable sins: crime, heresy, and marriage.
  &lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/heresy.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The first time I read that, in the 1990s, it sounded amusingly
medieval. How strange, to have to avoid committing heresy. But when
I reread it 20 years later it sounded like a description of
contemporary employment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are an ever-increasing number of opinions you can be fired
for. Those doing the firing don&#39;t use the word &quot;heresy&quot; to describe
them, but structurally they&#39;re equivalent. Structurally there are
two distinctive things about heresy: (1) that it takes priority
over the question of truth or falsity, and (2) that it outweighs
everything else the speaker has done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, when someone calls a statement &quot;x-ist,&quot; they&#39;re also
implicitly saying that this is the end of the discussion. They do
not, having said this, go on to consider whether the statement is
true or not. Using such labels is the conversational equivalent of
signalling an exception. That&#39;s one of the reasons they&#39;re used:
to end a discussion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you find yourself talking to someone who uses these labels a
lot, it might be worthwhile to ask them explicitly if they believe
any babies are being thrown out with the bathwater. Can a statement
be x-ist, for whatever value of x, and also true? If the answer is
yes, then they&#39;re admitting to banning the truth. That&#39;s obvious
enough that I&#39;d guess most would answer no. But if they answer no,
it&#39;s easy to show that they&#39;re mistaken, and that in practice such
labels are applied to statements regardless of their truth or
falsity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The clearest evidence of this is that whether a statement is
considered x-ist often depends on who said it. Truth doesn&#39;t work
that way. The same statement can&#39;t be true when one person says it,
but x-ist, and therefore false, when another person does.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/heresy.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other distinctive thing about heresies, compared to ordinary
opinions, is that the public expression of them outweighs everything
else the speaker has done. In ordinary matters, like knowledge of
history, or taste in music, you&#39;re judged by the average of your
opinions. A heresy is qualitatively different. It&#39;s like dropping
a chunk of uranium onto the scale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back in the day (and still, in some places) the punishment for
heresy was death. You could have led a life of exemplary goodness,
but if you publicly doubted, say, the divinity of Christ, you were
going to burn. Nowadays, in civilized countries, heretics only get
fired in the metaphorical sense, by losing their jobs. But the
structure of the situation is the same: the heresy
outweighs everything else. You could have spent the last ten years
saving children&#39;s lives, but if you express certain opinions, you&#39;re
automatically fired.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s much the same as if you committed a crime. No matter how
virtuously you&#39;ve lived, if you commit a crime, you must still
suffer the penalty of the law. Having lived a previously blameless
life might mitigate the punishment, but it doesn&#39;t affect whether
you&#39;re guilty or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A heresy is an opinion whose expression is treated like a crime —
one that makes some people feel not merely that you&#39;re mistaken,
but that you should be punished. Indeed, their desire to see you
punished is often stronger than it would be if you&#39;d committed an
actual crime. There are many on the far left who believe
strongly in the reintegration of felons (as I do myself), and yet
seem to feel that anyone guilty of certain heresies should never
work again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are always some heresies — some opinions you&#39;d be punished
for expressing. But there are a lot more now than there were a few
decades ago, and even those who are happy about this would have to
agree that it&#39;s so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why? Why has this antiquated-sounding religious concept come back
in a secular form? And why now?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You need two ingredients for a wave of intolerance: intolerant
people, and an ideology to guide them. The intolerant people are
always there. They exist in every sufficiently large society. That&#39;s
why waves of intolerance can arise so suddenly; all they need is
something to set them off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve already written an &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/conformism.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;essay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
describing the aggressively
conventional-minded. The short version is that people can be
classified in two dimensions according to (1) how independent- or
conventional-minded they are, and (2) how aggressive they are about
it. The aggressively conventional-minded are the enforcers of
orthodoxy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Normally they&#39;re only locally visible. They&#39;re the grumpy, censorious
people in a group — the ones who are always first to complain when
something violates the current rules of propriety. But occasionally,
like a vector field whose elements become aligned, a large number
of aggressively conventional-minded people unite behind some ideology
all at once. Then they become much more of a problem, because a mob
dynamic takes over, where the enthusiasm of each participant is
increased by the enthusiasm of the others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most notorious 20th century case may have been the Cultural
Revolution. Though initiated by Mao to undermine his rivals, the
Cultural Revolution was otherwise mostly a grass-roots phenomenon.
Mao said in essence: There are heretics among us. Seek them out and
punish them. And that&#39;s all the aggressively conventional-minded
ever need to hear. They went at it with the delight of dogs chasing
squirrels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To unite the conventional-minded, an ideology must have many of the
features of a religion. In particular it must have strict and
arbitrary rules that adherents can demonstrate their 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaHLd8de6nM&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;purity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
by obeying, and its adherents must believe that anyone who obeys these
rules is ipso facto morally superior to anyone who doesn&#39;t.

universities. It had a very strong component of moral purity, and
the aggressively conventional-minded seized upon it with their usual
eagerness — all the more because the relaxation of social norms
in the preceding decades meant there had been less and less to
forbid. The resulting wave of intolerance has been eerily similar
in form to the Cultural Revolution, though fortunately much smaller
in magnitude.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/heresy.html#f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve deliberately avoided mentioning any specific heresies here.
Partly because one of the universal tactics of heretic hunters, now
as in the past, is to accuse those who disapprove of the way in
which they suppress ideas of being heretics themselves. Indeed,
this tactic is so consistent that you could use it as a way of
detecting witch hunts in any era.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that&#39;s the second reason I&#39;ve avoided mentioning any specific
heresies. I want this essay to work in the future, not just now.
And unfortunately it probably will. The aggressively conventional-minded
will always be among us, looking for things to forbid. All they
need is an ideology to tell them what. And it&#39;s unlikely the current
one will be the last.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are aggressively conventional-minded people on both the right
and the left. The reason the current wave of intolerance comes from
the left is simply because the new unifying ideology happened to
come from the left. The next one might come from the right. Imagine
what that would be like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunately in western countries the suppression of heresies is
nothing like as bad as it used to be. Though the window of opinions
you can express publicly has narrowed in the last decade, it&#39;s still
much wider than it was a few hundred years ago. The problem is the
derivative. Up till about 1985 the window had been growing ever
wider. Anyone looking into the future in 1985 would have expected
freedom of expression to continue to increase. Instead it has
decreased.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/heresy.html#f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The situation is similar to what&#39;s happened with infectious diseases
like measles. Anyone looking into the future in 2010 would have
expected the number of measles cases in the US to continue to
decrease. Instead, thanks to anti-vaxxers, it has increased. The
absolute number is still not that high. The problem is the derivative.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/heresy.html#f6n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In both cases it&#39;s hard to know how much to worry. Is it really
dangerous to society as a whole if a handful of extremists refuse
to get their kids vaccinated, or shout down speakers at universities?
The point to start worrying is presumably when their efforts start
to spill over into everyone else&#39;s lives. And in both cases that
does seem to be happening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So it&#39;s probably worth spending some amount of effort on pushing
back to keep open the window of free expression. My hope is that
this essay will help form social antibodies not just against current
efforts to suppress ideas, but against the concept of heresy in
general. That&#39;s the real prize. How do you disable the concept of
heresy? Since the Enlightenment, western societies have discovered
many techniques for doing that, but there are surely more to be
discovered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall I&#39;m optimistic. Though the trend in freedom of expression
has been bad over the last decade, it&#39;s been good over the longer
term. And there are signs that the current wave of intolerance is
peaking. Independent-minded people I talk to seem more confident
than they did a few years ago. On the other side, even some of the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/opinion/cancel-culture-free-speech-poll.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;leaders&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are starting to wonder if things have 
gone too far. And popular culture among the young has already moved on. 
All we have
to do is keep pushing back, and the wave collapses. And then we&#39;ll
be net ahead, because as well as having defeated this wave, we&#39;ll
also have developed new tactics for resisting the next one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] 
Or more accurately, biographies of Newton, since Westfall wrote
two: a long version called &lt;i&gt;Never at Rest&lt;/i&gt;, and a shorter one called
&lt;i&gt;The Life of Isaac Newton&lt;/i&gt;. Both are great. The short version moves
faster, but the long one is full of interesting and often very funny
details. This passage is the same in both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Another more subtle but equally damning bit of evidence is
that claims of x-ism are never qualified. You never hear anyone say
that a statement is &quot;probably x-ist&quot; or &quot;almost certainly y-ist.&quot;
If claims of x-ism were actually claims about truth, you&#39;d expect
to see &quot;probably&quot; in front of &quot;x-ist&quot; as often as you see it in
front of &quot;fallacious.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] 
The rules must be strict, but they need not be demanding. So
the most effective type of rules are those about superficial matters,
like doctrinal minutiae, or the precise words adherents must use.
Such rules can be made extremely complicated, and yet don&#39;t repel
potential converts by requiring significant sacrifice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The superficial demands of orthodoxy make it an inexpensive substitute
for virtue. And that in turn is one of the reasons orthodoxy is so
attractive to bad people. You could be a horrible person, and yet
as long as you&#39;re orthodox, you&#39;re better than everyone who isn&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] 
Arguably there were two. The first had died down somewhat by
2000, but was followed by a second in the 2010s, probably caused
by social media.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] 
Fortunately most of those trying to suppress ideas today still
respect Enlightenment principles enough to pay lip service to them.
They know they&#39;re not supposed to ban ideas per se, so they have
to recast the ideas as causing &quot;harm,&quot; which sounds like something
that can be banned. The more extreme try to claim speech itself is
violence, or even that silence is. But strange as it may sound,
such gymnastics are a good sign. We&#39;ll know we&#39;re really in trouble
when they stop bothering to invent pretenses for banning ideas —
when, like the medieval church, they say &quot;Damn right we&#39;re banning
ideas, and in fact here&#39;s a list of them.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f6n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] 
People only have the luxury of ignoring the medical consensus
about vaccines because vaccines have worked so well. If we didn&#39;t
have any vaccines at all, the mortality rate would be so high that
most current anti-vaxxers would be begging for them. And the situation
with freedom of expression is similar. It&#39;s only because they live
in a world created by the Enlightenment that kids from the suburbs
can play at banning ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;888888&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Marc Andreessen, Chris Best,

you that you didn&#39;t know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas
into words is a severe test. The first words you choose are usually
wrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and over &lt;!-- if you want --&gt; to
get them exactly right. And your ideas won&#39;t just be imprecise, but
incomplete too. Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones
you thought of while you were writing it. Indeed, that&#39;s why I write
them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once you publish something, the convention is that whatever you
wrote was what you thought before you wrote it. These were your
ideas, and now you&#39;ve expressed them. But you know this isn&#39;t true.
You know that putting your ideas into words changed them. And not
just the ideas you published. Presumably there were others that
turned out to be too broken to fix, and those you discarded instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s not just having to commit your ideas to specific words that
makes writing so exacting. The real test is reading what you&#39;ve
written. You have to pretend to be a neutral reader who knows nothing
of what&#39;s in your head, only what you wrote. When he reads what you
wrote, does it seem correct? Does it seem complete? If you make an
effort, you can read your writing as if you were a complete stranger,
and when you do the news is usually bad. It takes me many cycles
before I can get an essay past the stranger. But the stranger is
rational, so you always can, if you ask him what he needs. If he&#39;s
not satisfied because you failed to mention x or didn&#39;t qualify
some sentence sufficiently, then you mention x or add more
qualifications. Happy now? It may cost you some nice sentences, but
you have to resign yourself to that. You just have to make them as
good as you can and still satisfy the stranger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This much, I assume, won&#39;t be that controversial. I think it will
accord with the experience of anyone who has tried to write about
anything nontrivial. There may exist people whose thoughts are so
perfectly formed that they just flow straight into words. But I&#39;ve
never known anyone who could do this, and if I met someone who said
they could, it would seem evidence of their limitations rather than
their ability. Indeed, this is a trope in movies: the guy who claims
to have a plan for doing some difficult thing, and who when questioned
further, taps his head and says &quot;It&#39;s all up here.&quot; Everyone watching
the movie knows what that means. At best the plan is vague and
incomplete. Very likely there&#39;s some undiscovered flaw that invalidates
it completely. At best it&#39;s a plan for a plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In precisely defined domains it&#39;s possible to form complete ideas
in your head. People can play chess in their heads, for example.
And mathematicians can do some amount of math in their heads, though
they don&#39;t seem to feel sure of a proof over a certain length till
they write it down. But this only seems possible with ideas you can
express in a formal language.  &lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/words.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt; Arguably what such people are
doing is putting ideas into words in their heads. I can to some
extent write essays in my head. I&#39;ll sometimes think of a paragraph
while walking or lying in bed that survives nearly unchanged in the
final version. But really I&#39;m writing when I do this. I&#39;m doing the
mental part of writing; my fingers just aren&#39;t moving as I do it.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/words.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can know a great deal about something without writing about it.
Can you ever know so much that you wouldn&#39;t learn more from trying
to explain what you know? I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;ve written about at
least two subjects I know well — Lisp hacking and startups
— and in both cases I learned a lot from writing about them.
In both cases there were things I didn&#39;t consciously realize till
I had to explain them. And I don&#39;t think my experience was anomalous.
A great deal of knowledge is unconscious, and experts have if
anything a higher proportion of unconscious knowledge than beginners.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m not saying that writing is the best way to explore all ideas.
If you have ideas about architecture, presumably the best way to
explore them is to build actual buildings. What I&#39;m saying is that
however much you learn from exploring ideas in other ways, you&#39;ll
still learn new things from writing about them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Putting ideas into words doesn&#39;t have to mean writing, of course.
You can also do it the old way, by talking. But in my experience,
writing is the stricter test. You have to commit to a single, optimal
sequence of words. Less can go unsaid when you don&#39;t have tone of
voice to carry meaning. And you can focus in a way that would seem
excessive in conversation. I&#39;ll often spend 2 weeks on an essay and
reread drafts 50 times. If you did that in conversation
it would seem evidence of some kind of
mental disorder. 
If you&#39;re lazy,
of course, writing and talking are equally useless. But if you want
to push yourself to get things right, writing is the steeper hill.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/words.html#f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason I&#39;ve spent so long establishing this rather obvious point
is that it leads to another that many people will find shocking.
If writing down your ideas always makes them more precise and more
complete, then no one who hasn&#39;t written about a topic has fully
formed ideas about it. And someone who never writes has no fully
formed ideas about anything nontrivial.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It feels to them as if they do, especially if they&#39;re not in the
habit of critically examining their own thinking. Ideas can feel
complete. It&#39;s only when you try to put them into words that you
discover they&#39;re not. So if you never subject your ideas to that
test, you&#39;ll not only never have fully formed ideas, but also never
realize it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Putting ideas into words is certainly no guarantee that they&#39;ll be
right. Far from it. But though it&#39;s not a sufficient condition, it
is a necessary one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] Machinery and
circuits are formal languages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] I thought of this
sentence as I was walking down the street in Palo Alto.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] There are two
senses of talking to someone: a strict sense in which the conversation
is verbal, and a more general sense in which it can take any form,
including writing. In the limit case (e.g. Seneca&#39;s letters),
conversation in the latter sense becomes essay writing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It can be very useful to talk (in either sense) with other people
as you&#39;re writing something. But a verbal conversation will never
be more exacting than when you&#39;re talking about something you&#39;re
writing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;888888&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Trevor Blackwell, Patrick
Collison, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><link>http://paulgraham.com/words.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://paulgraham.com/words.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Is There Such a Thing as Good Taste?</title><description>November 2021&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;(This essay is derived from a talk at the Cambridge Union.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I was a kid, I&#39;d have said there wasn&#39;t. My father told me so.
Some people like some things, and other people like other things,
and who&#39;s to say who&#39;s right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seemed so obvious that there was no such thing as good taste
that it was only through indirect evidence that I realized my father
was wrong. And that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to give you here: a proof by
reductio ad absurdum. If we start from the premise that there&#39;s no
such thing as good taste, we end up with conclusions that are
obviously false, and therefore the premise must be wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We&#39;d better start by saying what good taste is. There&#39;s a narrow
sense in which it refers to aesthetic judgements and a broader one
in which it refers to preferences of any kind. The strongest proof
would be to show that taste exists in the narrowest sense, so I&#39;m
going to talk about taste in art. You have better taste than me if
the art you like is better than the art I like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If there&#39;s no such thing as good taste, then there&#39;s no such thing
as &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/goodart.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;good art&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Because if there is such a
thing as good art, it&#39;s
easy to tell which of two people has better taste. Show them a lot
of works by artists they&#39;ve never seen before and ask them to
choose the best, and whoever chooses the better art has better
taste.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So if you want to discard the concept of good taste, you also have
to discard the concept of good art. And that means you have to
discard the possibility of people being good at making it. Which
means there&#39;s no way for artists to be good at their jobs. And not
just visual artists, but anyone who is in any sense an artist. You
can&#39;t have good actors, or novelists, or composers, or dancers
either. You can have popular novelists, but not good ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We don&#39;t realize how far we&#39;d have to go if we discarded the concept
of good taste, because we don&#39;t even debate the most obvious cases.
But it doesn&#39;t just mean we can&#39;t say which of two famous painters
is better. It means we can&#39;t say that any painter is better than a
randomly chosen eight year old.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was how I realized my father was wrong. I started studying
painting. And it was just like other kinds of work I&#39;d done: you
could do it well, or badly, and if you tried hard, you could get
better at it. And it was obvious that Leonardo and Bellini were
much better at it than me. That gap between us was not imaginary.
They were so good. And if they could be good, then art could be
good, and there was such a thing as good taste after all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that I&#39;ve explained how to show there is such a thing as good
taste, I should also explain why people think there isn&#39;t. There
are two reasons. One is that there&#39;s always so much disagreement
about taste. Most people&#39;s response to art is a tangle of unexamined
impulses. Is the artist famous? Is the subject attractive? Is this
the sort of art they&#39;re supposed to like? Is it hanging in a famous
museum, or reproduced in a big, expensive book? In practice most
people&#39;s response to art is dominated by such extraneous factors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the people who do claim to have good taste are so often mistaken.
The paintings admired by the so-called experts in one generation
are often so different from those admired a few generations later.
It&#39;s easy to conclude there&#39;s nothing real there at all. It&#39;s only
when you isolate this force, for example by trying to paint and
comparing your work to Bellini&#39;s, that you can see that it does in
fact exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other reason people doubt that art can be good is that there
doesn&#39;t seem to be any room in the art for this goodness. The
argument goes like this. Imagine several people looking at a work
of art and judging how good it is. If being good art really is a
property of objects, it should be in the object somehow. But it
doesn&#39;t seem to be; it seems to be something happening in the heads
of each of the observers. And if they disagree, how do you choose
between them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The solution to this puzzle is to realize that the purpose of art
is to work on its human audience, and humans have a lot in common.
And to the extent the things an object acts upon respond in the
same way, that&#39;s arguably what it means for the object to have the
corresponding property. If everything a particle interacts with
behaves as if the particle had a mass of &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;, then it has a mass of
&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;. So the distinction between &quot;objective&quot; and &quot;subjective&quot; is not
binary, but a matter of degree, depending on how much the subjects
have in common. Particles interacting with one another are at one
pole, but people interacting with art are not all the way at the
other; their reactions aren&#39;t &lt;i&gt;random&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because people&#39;s responses to art aren&#39;t random, art can be designed
to operate on people, and be good or bad depending on how effectively
it does so. Much as a vaccine can be. If someone were talking about
the ability of a vaccine to confer immunity, it would seem very
frivolous to object that conferring immunity wasn&#39;t really a property
of vaccines, because acquiring immunity is something that happens
in the immune system of each individual person. Sure, people&#39;s
immune systems vary, and a vaccine that worked on one might not
work on another, but that doesn&#39;t make it meaningless to talk about
the effectiveness of a vaccine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The situation with art is messier, of course. You can&#39;t measure
effectiveness by simply taking a vote, as you do with vaccines.
You have to imagine the responses of subjects with a deep knowledge
of art, and enough clarity of mind to be able to ignore extraneous
influences like the fame of the artist. And even then you&#39;d still
see some disagreement. People do vary, and judging art is hard,
especially recent art. There is definitely not a total order either
of works or of people&#39;s ability to judge them. But there is equally
definitely a partial order of both. So while it&#39;s not possible to
have perfect taste, it is possible to have good taste.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;888888&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to the Cambridge Union for inviting me, and to Trevor
Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts
of this.

that he was really smart. Even the ones who tried to give you a
more sophisticated-sounding answer would probably think this first.
Till a few years ago I would have given the same answer myself. But
that wasn&#39;t what was special about Einstein. What was special about
him was that he had important new ideas. Being very smart was a
necessary precondition for having those ideas, but the two are not
identical.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It may seem a hair-splitting distinction to point out that intelligence
and its consequences are not identical, but it isn&#39;t. There&#39;s a big
gap between them. Anyone who&#39;s spent time around universities and
research labs knows how big. There are a lot of genuinely smart
people who don&#39;t achieve very much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I grew up thinking that being smart was the thing most to be desired.
Perhaps you did too. But I bet it&#39;s not what you really want. Imagine
you had a choice between being really smart but discovering nothing
new, and being less smart but discovering lots of new ideas. Surely
you&#39;d take the latter. I would. The choice makes me uncomfortable,
but when you see the two options laid out explicitly like that,
it&#39;s obvious which is better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason the choice makes me uncomfortable is that being smart
still feels like the thing that matters, even though I know
intellectually that it isn&#39;t. I spent so many years thinking it
was. The circumstances of childhood are a perfect storm for fostering
this illusion. Intelligence is much easier to measure than the value
of new ideas, and you&#39;re constantly being judged by it. Whereas
even the kids who will ultimately discover new things aren&#39;t usually
discovering them yet. For kids that way inclined, intelligence is
the only game in town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are more subtle reasons too, which persist long into adulthood.
Intelligence wins in conversation, and thus becomes the basis of
the dominance hierarchy.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/smart.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
Plus having new ideas is such a new
thing historically, and even now done by so few people, that society
hasn&#39;t yet assimilated the fact that this is the actual destination,
and intelligence merely a means to an end.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/smart.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why do so many smart people fail to discover anything new? Viewed
from that direction, the question seems a rather depressing one.
But there&#39;s another way to look at it that&#39;s not just more optimistic,
but more interesting as well. Clearly intelligence is not the only
ingredient in having new ideas. What are the other ingredients?
Are they things we could cultivate?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because the trouble with intelligence, they say, is that it&#39;s mostly
inborn. The evidence for this seems fairly convincing, especially
considering that most of us don&#39;t want it to be true, and the
evidence thus has to face a stiff headwind. But I&#39;m not going
to get into that question here, because it&#39;s the other ingredients
in new ideas that I care about, and it&#39;s clear that many of them
can be cultivated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That means the truth is excitingly different from the story I got
as a kid. If intelligence is what matters, and also mostly inborn,
the natural consequence is a sort of &lt;i&gt;Brave New World&lt;/i&gt; fatalism. The
best you can do is figure out what sort of work you have an &quot;aptitude&quot;
for, so that whatever intelligence you were born with will at least
be put to the best use, and then work as hard as you can at it.
Whereas if intelligence isn&#39;t what matters, but only one of several
ingredients in what does, and many of those aren&#39;t inborn, things
get more interesting. You have a lot more control, but the problem
of how to arrange your life becomes that much more complicated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what are the other ingredients in having new ideas? The fact
that I can even ask this question proves the point I raised earlier
— that society hasn&#39;t assimilated the fact that it&#39;s this and not
intelligence that matters. Otherwise we&#39;d all know the answers
to such a fundamental question.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/smart.html#f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m not going to try to provide a complete catalogue of the other
ingredients here. This is the first time I&#39;ve posed
the question to myself this way, and I think it may take a while
to answer. But I wrote recently about one of the most important:
an obsessive &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/genius.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;interest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a particular topic. 
And this can definitely be cultivated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another quality you need in order to discover new ideas is
&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/think.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;independent-mindedness&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I wouldn&#39;t want to 
claim that this is
distinct from intelligence — I&#39;d be reluctant to call someone smart
who wasn&#39;t independent-minded — but though largely inborn, this
quality seems to be something that can be cultivated to some extent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are general techniques for having new ideas — for example,
for working on your own &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/own.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;projects&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
and
for overcoming the obstacles you face with &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/early.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;early&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; work
— and these
can all be learned. Some of them can be learned by societies. And
there are also collections of techniques for generating specific types
of new ideas, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html&quot;&gt;startup ideas&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/essay.html&quot;&gt;essay topics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And of course there are a lot of fairly mundane ingredients in
discovering new ideas, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;working hard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 
getting enough sleep, avoiding certain
kinds of stress, having the right colleagues, and finding tricks
for working on what you want even when it&#39;s not what you&#39;re supposed
to be working on. Anything that prevents people from doing great
work has an inverse that helps them to. And this class of ingredients
is not as boring as it might seem at first. For example, having new
ideas is generally associated with youth. But perhaps it&#39;s not youth
per se that yields new ideas, but specific things that come with
youth, like good health and lack of responsibilities. Investigating
this might lead to strategies that will help people of any age to
have better ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the most surprising ingredients in having new ideas is writing
ability. There&#39;s a class of new ideas that are best discovered by
writing essays and books. And that &quot;by&quot; is deliberate: you don&#39;t
think of the ideas first, and then merely write them down. There
is a kind of thinking that one does by writing, and if you&#39;re clumsy
at writing, or don&#39;t enjoy doing it, that will get in your way if
you try to do this kind of thinking.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/smart.html#f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I predict the gap between intelligence and new ideas will turn out
to be an interesting place. If we think of this gap merely as a measure
of unrealized potential, it becomes a sort of wasteland that we try to
hurry through with our eyes averted. But if we flip the question,
and start inquiring into the other ingredients in new ideas that
it implies must exist, we can mine this gap for discoveries about
discovery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
What wins in conversation depends on who with. It ranges from
mere aggressiveness at the bottom, through quick-wittedness in the
middle, to something closer to actual intelligence at the top,
though probably always with some component of quick-wittedness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Just as intelligence isn&#39;t the only ingredient in having new
ideas, having new ideas isn&#39;t the only thing intelligence is useful
for. It&#39;s also useful, for example, in diagnosing problems and figuring
out how to fix them. Both overlap with having new ideas, but both
have an end that doesn&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those ways of using intelligence are much more common than having
new ideas. And in such cases intelligence is even harder to distinguish
from its consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Some would attribute the difference between intelligence and
having new ideas to &quot;creativity,&quot; but this doesn&#39;t seem a very
useful term. As well as being pretty vague, it&#39;s shifted half a frame
sideways from what we care about: it&#39;s neither separable from
intelligence, nor responsible for all the difference between
intelligence and having new ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Curiously enough, this essay is an example. It started out
as an essay about writing ability. But when I came to the distinction
between intelligence and having new ideas, that seemed so much more
important that I turned the original essay inside out, making that
the topic and my original topic one of the points in it. As in many
other fields, that level of reworking is easier to contemplate once
you&#39;ve had a lot of practice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;888888&quot;&gt;

are basically equivalent, they&#39;re making a statement not about
languages but about the kind of programming they&#39;ve done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;99.5% of programming consists of gluing together calls to library
functions. All popular languages are equally good at this. So one
can easily spend one&#39;s whole career operating in the intersection
of popular programming languages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the other .5% of programming is disproportionately interesting.
If you want to learn what it consists of, the weirdness of weird
languages is a good clue to follow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weird languages aren&#39;t weird by accident. Not the good ones, at
least. The weirdness of the good ones usually implies the existence
of some form of programming that&#39;s not just the usual gluing together
of library calls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A concrete example: Lisp macros. Lisp macros seem weird even to
many Lisp programmers. They&#39;re not only not in the intersection of
popular languages, but by their nature would be hard to implement
properly in a language without turning it into a dialect of
Lisp. And macros are definitely evidence of techniques that go
beyond glue programming. For example, solving problems by first
writing a language for problems of that type, and then writing
your specific application in it. Nor is this all you can do with
macros; it&#39;s just one region in a space of program-manipulating
techniques that even now is far from fully explored.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So if you want to expand your concept of what programming can be,
one way to do it is by learning weird languages. Pick a language
that most programmers consider weird but whose median user is smart,
and then focus on the differences between this language and the
intersection of popular languages. What can you say in this language
that would be impossibly inconvenient to say in others? In the
process of learning how to say things you couldn&#39;t previously say,
you&#39;ll probably be learning how to think things you couldn&#39;t
previously think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;888888&quot;&gt;

Masad, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.

Anyone who&#39;s been to school knows what it entails, even if they
chose not to do it. There are 12 year olds who work amazingly hard. And
yet when I ask if I know more about working hard now than when I
was in school, the answer is definitely yes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing I know is that if you want to do great things, you&#39;ll
have to work very hard. I wasn&#39;t sure of that as a kid. Schoolwork
varied in difficulty; one didn&#39;t always have to work super hard to
do well. And some of the things famous adults did, they seemed to
do almost effortlessly. Was there, perhaps, some way to evade hard
work through sheer brilliance? Now I know the answer to that question.
There isn&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason some subjects seemed easy was that my school had low
standards. And the reason famous adults seemed to do things
effortlessly was years of practice; they made it look easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, those famous adults usually had a lot of natural ability
too. There are three ingredients in great work: natural ability,
practice, and effort. You can do pretty well with just two, but to
do the best work you need all three: you need great natural ability
&lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; to have practiced a lot &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; to be trying very hard. 
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bill Gates, for example, was among the smartest people in business
in his era, but he was also among the hardest working. &quot;I never
took a day off in my twenties,&quot; he said. &quot;Not one.&quot; It was similar
with Lionel Messi. He had great natural ability, but when his youth
coaches talk about him, what they remember is not his talent but
his dedication and his desire to win. P. G. Wodehouse would probably
get my vote for best English writer of the 20th century, if I had
to choose. Certainly no one ever made it look easier. But no one
ever worked harder. At 74, he wrote
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  with each new book of mine I have, as I say, the feeling that
  this time I have picked a lemon in the garden of literature. A
  good thing, really, I suppose. Keeps one up on one&#39;s toes and
  makes one rewrite every sentence ten times. Or in many cases
  twenty times.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sounds a bit extreme, you think. And yet Bill Gates sounds even
more extreme. Not one day off in ten years?  These two had about
as much natural ability as anyone could have, and yet they also
worked about as hard as anyone could work. You need both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That seems so obvious, and yet in practice we find it slightly hard
to grasp. There&#39;s a faint xor between talent and hard work. It comes
partly from popular culture, where it seems to run very deep, and
partly from the fact that the outliers are so rare. If great talent
and great drive are both rare, then people with both are rare
squared. Most people you meet who have a lot of one will have less
of the other. But you&#39;ll need both if you want to be an outlier
yourself. And since you can&#39;t really change how much natural talent
you have, in practice doing great work, insofar as you can, reduces
to working very hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s straightforward to work hard if you have clearly defined,
externally imposed goals, as you do in school. There is some technique
to it: you have to learn not to lie to yourself, not to procrastinate
(which is a form of lying to yourself), not to get distracted, and
not to give up when things go wrong. But this level of discipline
seems to be within the reach of quite young children, if they want
it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I&#39;ve learned since I was a kid is how to work toward goals
that are neither clearly defined nor externally imposed. You&#39;ll
probably have to learn both if you want to do really great things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most basic level of which is simply to feel you should be working
without anyone telling you to. Now, when I&#39;m not working hard, alarm
bells go off. I can&#39;t be sure I&#39;m getting anywhere when I&#39;m working
hard, but I can be sure I&#39;m getting nowhere when I&#39;m not, and it
feels awful.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There wasn&#39;t a single point when I learned this. Like most little
kids, I enjoyed the feeling of achievement when I learned or did
something new. As I grew older, this morphed into a feeling of
disgust when I wasn&#39;t achieving anything. The one precisely dateable
landmark I have is when I stopped watching TV, at age&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Several people I&#39;ve talked to remember getting serious about work
around this age. When I asked Patrick Collison when he started to
find idleness distasteful, he said
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  I think around age 13 or 14. I have a clear memory from around
  then of sitting in the sitting room, staring outside, and wondering
  why I was wasting my summer holiday.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Perhaps something changes at adolescence. That would make sense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strangely enough, the biggest obstacle to getting serious about
work was probably school, which made work (what they called work)
seem boring and pointless. I had to learn what real work was before
I could wholeheartedly desire to do it. That took a while, because
even in college a lot of the work is pointless; there are entire
departments that are pointless. But as I learned the shape of real
work, I found that my desire to do it slotted into it as if they&#39;d
been made for each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I suspect most people have to learn what work is before they can
love it. Hardy wrote eloquently about this in &lt;i&gt;A Mathematician&#39;s
Apology&lt;/i&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  I do not remember having felt, as a boy, any &lt;i&gt;passion&lt;/i&gt; for
  mathematics, and such notions as I may have had of the career of
  a mathematician were far from noble. I thought of mathematics in
  terms of examinations and scholarships: I wanted to beat other
  boys, and this seemed to be the way in which I could do so most
  decisively.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He didn&#39;t learn what math was really about till part way through
college, when he read Jordan&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Cours d&#39;analyse&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  I shall never forget the astonishment with which I read that
  remarkable work, the first inspiration for so many mathematicians
  of my generation, and learnt for the first time as I read it what
  mathematics really meant.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There are two separate kinds of fakeness you need to learn to
discount in order to understand what real work is. One is the kind
Hardy encountered in school. Subjects get distorted when they&#39;re
adapted to be taught to kids — often so distorted that they&#39;re
nothing like the work done by actual practitioners.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
The other
kind of fakeness is intrinsic to certain types of work. Some types
of work are inherently bogus, or at best mere busywork.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s a kind of solidity to real work. It&#39;s not all writing the
&lt;i&gt;Principia&lt;/i&gt;, but it all feels necessary. That&#39;s a vague criterion,
but it&#39;s deliberately vague, because it has to cover a lot of
different types.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once you know the shape of real work, you have to learn how many
hours a day to spend on it. You can&#39;t solve this problem by simply
working every waking hour, because in many kinds of work there&#39;s a
point beyond which the quality of the result will start to decline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That limit varies depending on the type of work and the person.
I&#39;ve done several different kinds of work, and the limits were
different for each. My limit for the harder types of writing or
programming is about five hours a day. Whereas when I was running
a startup, I could
work all the time. At least for the three years I did it; if I&#39;d
kept going much longer, I&#39;d probably have needed to take occasional
vacations.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only way to find the limit is by crossing it. Cultivate a
sensitivity to the quality of the work you&#39;re doing, and then you&#39;ll
notice if it decreases because you&#39;re working too hard. Honesty is
critical here, in both directions: you have to notice when you&#39;re
being lazy, but also when you&#39;re working too hard. And if you think
there&#39;s something admirable about working too hard, get that idea
out of your head. You&#39;re not merely getting worse results, but
getting them because you&#39;re showing off — if not to other people,
then to yourself.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f6n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finding the limit of working hard is a constant, ongoing process,
not something you do just once. Both the difficulty of the work and
your ability to do it can vary hour to hour, so you need to be
constantly judging both how hard you&#39;re trying and how well you&#39;re
doing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trying hard doesn&#39;t mean constantly pushing yourself to work, though.
There may be some people who do, but I think my experience is fairly
typical, and I only have to push myself occasionally when I&#39;m
starting a project or when I encounter some sort of check. That&#39;s
when I&#39;m in danger of procrastinating. But once I get rolling, I
tend to keep going.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What keeps me going depends on the type of work. When I was working
on Viaweb, I was driven by fear of failure. I barely procrastinated
at all then, because there was always something that needed doing,
and if I could put more distance between me and the pursuing beast
by doing it, why wait? &lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f7n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
Whereas what drives me now, writing
essays, is the flaws in them. Between essays I fuss for a few days,
like a dog circling while it decides exactly where to lie down. But
once I get started on one, I don&#39;t have to push myself to work,
because there&#39;s always some error or omission already pushing me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do make some amount of effort to focus on important topics. Many
problems have a hard core at the center, surrounded by easier stuff
at the edges. Working hard means aiming toward the center to the
extent you can. Some days you may not be able to; some days you&#39;ll
only be able to work on the easier, peripheral stuff. But you should
always be aiming as close to the center as you can without stalling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bigger question of what to do with your life is one of these
problems with a hard core. There are important problems at the
center, which tend to be hard, and less important, easier ones at
the edges. So as well as the small, daily adjustments involved in
working on a specific problem, you&#39;ll occasionally have to make
big, lifetime-scale adjustments about which type of work to do.
And the rule is the same: working hard means aiming toward the
center — toward the most ambitious problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By center, though, I mean the actual center, not merely the current
consensus about the center. The consensus about which problems are
most important is often mistaken, both in general and within specific
fields. If you disagree with it, and you&#39;re right, that could
represent a valuable opportunity to do something new.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The more ambitious types of work will usually be harder, but although
you should not be in denial about this, neither should you treat
difficulty as an infallible guide in deciding what to do. If you
discover some ambitious type of work that&#39;s a bargain in the sense
of being easier for you than other people, either because of the
abilities you happen to have, or because of some new way you&#39;ve
found to approach it, or simply because you&#39;re more excited about
it, by all means work on that. Some of the best work is done by
people who find an easy way to do something hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As well as learning the shape of real work, you need to figure out
which kind you&#39;re suited for. And that doesn&#39;t just mean figuring
out which kind your natural abilities match the best; it doesn&#39;t
mean that if you&#39;re 7 feet tall, you have to play basketball. What
you&#39;re suited for depends not just on your talents but perhaps even
more on your interests. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/genius.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;deep interest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
in a topic makes people
work harder than any amount of discipline can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It can be harder to discover your interests than your talents.
There are fewer types of talent than interest, and they start to
be judged early in childhood, whereas interest in a topic is a
subtle thing that may not mature till your twenties, or even later.
The topic may not even exist earlier. Plus there are some powerful
sources of error you need to learn to discount. Are you really
interested in x, or do you want to work on it because you&#39;ll make
a lot of money, or because other people will be impressed with you,
or because your parents want you to?
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f8n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The difficulty of figuring out what to work on varies enormously
from one person to another. That&#39;s one of the most important things
I&#39;ve learned about work since I was a kid. As a kid, you get the
impression that everyone has a calling, and all they have to do is
figure out what it is. That&#39;s how it works in movies, and in the
streamlined biographies fed to kids. Sometimes it works that way
in real life. Some people figure out what to do as children and
just do it, like Mozart. But others, like Newton, turn restlessly
from one kind of work to another. Maybe in retrospect we can identify
one as their calling — we can wish Newton spent more time on math
and physics and less on alchemy and theology — but this is an
&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/disc.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;illusion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; induced by hindsight bias. 
There was no voice calling to him that he could have heard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So while some people&#39;s lives converge fast, there will be others
whose lives never converge. And for these people, figuring out what
to work on is not so much a prelude to working hard as an ongoing
part of it, like one of a set of simultaneous equations. For these
people, the process I described earlier has a third component: along
with measuring both how hard you&#39;re working and how well you&#39;re
doing, you have to think about whether you should keep working in
this field or switch to another. If you&#39;re working hard but not
getting good enough results, you should switch. It sounds simple
expressed that way, but in practice it&#39;s very difficult. You shouldn&#39;t
give up on the first day just because you work hard and don&#39;t get
anywhere. You need to give yourself time to get going. But how much
time? And what should you do if work that was going well stops going
well? How much time do you give yourself then?
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html#f9n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What even counts as good results? That can be really hard to decide.
If you&#39;re exploring an area few others have worked in, you may not
even know what good results look like. History is full of examples
of people who misjudged the importance of what they were working
on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best test of whether it&#39;s worthwhile to work on something is
whether you find it interesting. That may sound like a dangerously
subjective measure, but it&#39;s probably the most accurate one you&#39;re
going to get. You&#39;re the one working on the stuff. Who&#39;s in a better
position than you to judge whether it&#39;s important, and what&#39;s a
better predictor of its importance than whether it&#39;s interesting?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For this test to work, though, you have to be honest with yourself.
Indeed, that&#39;s the most striking thing about the whole question of
working hard: how at each point it depends on being honest with
yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working hard is not just a dial you turn up to 11. It&#39;s a complicated,
dynamic system that has to be tuned just right at each point. You
have to understand the shape of real work, see clearly what kind
you&#39;re best suited for, aim as close to the true core of it as you
can, accurately judge at each moment both what you&#39;re capable of
and how you&#39;re doing, and put in as many hours each day as you can
without harming the quality of the result. This network is too
complicated to trick. But if you&#39;re consistently honest and
clear-sighted, it will automatically assume an optimal shape, and
you&#39;ll be productive in a way few people are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
In &quot;The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius&quot; I said the three ingredients
in great work were natural ability, determination, and interest.
That&#39;s the formula in the preceding stage; determination and interest
yield practice and effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I mean this at a resolution of days, not hours. You&#39;ll often
get somewhere while not working in the sense that the solution to
a problem comes to you while taking a 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/top.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;shower&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or even in your sleep,
but only because you were working hard on it the day before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s good to go on vacation occasionally, but when I go on vacation,
I like to learn new things. I wouldn&#39;t like just sitting on a beach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The thing kids do in school that&#39;s most like the real version
is sports. Admittedly because many sports originated as games played
in schools. But in this one area, at least, kids are doing exactly
what adults do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the average American high school, you have a choice of pretending
to do something serious, or seriously doing something pretend.
Arguably the latter is no worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Knowing what you want to work on doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll be able
to. Most people have to spend a lot of their time working on things
they don&#39;t want to, especially early on. But if you know what you
want to do, you at least know what direction to nudge your life in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The lower time limits for intense work suggest a solution to
the problem of having less time to work after you have kids: switch
to harder problems. In effect I did that, though not deliberately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f6n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Some cultures have a tradition of performative hard work. I
don&#39;t love this idea, because (a) it makes a parody of something
important and (b) it causes people to wear themselves out doing
things that don&#39;t matter. I don&#39;t know enough to say for sure whether
it&#39;s net good or bad, but my guess is bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f7n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
One of the reasons people work so hard on startups is that
startups can fail, and when they do, that failure tends to be both
decisive and conspicuous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f8n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
It&#39;s ok to work on something to make a lot of money. You need
to solve the money problem somehow, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with
doing that efficiently by trying to make a lot at once. I suppose
it would even be ok to be interested in money for its own sake;
whatever floats your boat. Just so long as you&#39;re conscious of your
motivations. The thing to avoid is &lt;i&gt;unconsciously&lt;/i&gt; letting the need
for money warp your ideas about what kind of work you find most
interesting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f9n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Many people face this question on a smaller scale with
individual projects. But it&#39;s easier both to recognize and to accept
a dead end in a single project than to abandon some type of work
entirely. The more determined you are, the harder it gets. Like a
Spanish Flu victim, you&#39;re fighting your own immune system: Instead
of giving up, you tell yourself, I should just try harder. And who
can say you&#39;re not right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

told me he couldn&#39;t wait to get home to write more of the story he
was working on. This made me as happy as anything I&#39;ve heard him
say — not just because he was excited about his story, but because
he&#39;d discovered this way of working. Working on a project of your
own is as different from ordinary work as skating is from walking.
It&#39;s more fun, but also much more productive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What proportion of great work has been done by people who were
skating in this sense? If not all of it, certainly a lot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is something special about working on a project of your own.
I wouldn&#39;t say exactly that you&#39;re happier. A better word would be
excited, or engaged. You&#39;re happy when things are going well, but
often they aren&#39;t. When I&#39;m writing an essay, most of the time I&#39;m
worried and puzzled: worried that the essay will turn out badly,
and puzzled because I&#39;m groping for some idea that I can&#39;t see
clearly enough. Will I be able to pin it down with words? In the
end I usually can, if I take long enough, but I&#39;m never sure; the
first few attempts often fail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have moments of happiness when things work out, but they don&#39;t
last long, because then you&#39;re on to the next problem. So why do
it at all? Because to the kind of people who like working this way,
nothing else feels as right. You feel as if you&#39;re an animal in its
natural habitat, doing what you were meant to do — not always
happy, maybe, but awake and alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many kids experience the excitement of working on projects of their
own. The hard part is making this converge with the work you do as
an adult. And our customs make it harder. We treat &quot;playing&quot; and
&quot;hobbies&quot; as qualitatively different from &quot;work&quot;. It&#39;s not clear
to a kid building a treehouse that there&#39;s a direct (though long)
route from that to architecture or engineering. And instead of
pointing out the route, we conceal it, by implicitly treating the
stuff kids do as different from real work.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/own.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of telling kids that their treehouses could be on the path
to the work they do as adults, we tell them the path goes through
school. And unfortunately schoolwork tends to be very different from
working on projects of one&#39;s own. It&#39;s usually neither a project,
nor one&#39;s own. So as school gets more serious, working on projects
of one&#39;s own is something that survives, if at all, as a thin thread
off to the side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s a bit sad to think of all the high school kids turning their
backs on building treehouses and sitting in class dutifully learning
about Darwin or Newton to pass some exam, when the work that made
Darwin and Newton famous was actually closer in spirit to building
treehouses than studying for exams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I had to choose between my kids getting good grades and 
working on ambitious projects of their own, I&#39;d pick
the projects. And not because I&#39;m an indulgent parent, but because
I&#39;ve been on the other end and I know which has more predictive
value. When I was picking startups for Y Combinator, I didn&#39;t care
about applicants&#39; grades. But if they&#39;d worked on projects of their
own, I wanted to hear all about those.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/own.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It may be inevitable that school is the way it is. I&#39;m not saying
we have to redesign it (though I&#39;m not saying we don&#39;t), just that
we should understand what it does to our attitudes to work — that
it steers us toward the dutiful plodding kind of work, often using
competition as bait, and away from skating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are occasionally times when schoolwork becomes a project of
one&#39;s own. Whenever I had to write a paper, that would become a
project of my own — except in English classes, ironically, because
the things one has to write in English classes are so 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/essay.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;bogus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And
when I got to college and started taking CS classes, the programs
I had to write became projects of my own. Whenever I was writing
or programming, I was usually skating, and that has been true ever
since.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So where exactly is the edge of projects of one&#39;s own? That&#39;s an
interesting question, partly because the answer is so complicated,
and partly because there&#39;s so much at stake. There turn out to be
two senses in which work can be one&#39;s own: 1) that you&#39;re doing it
voluntarily, rather than merely because someone told you to, and
2) that you&#39;re doing it by yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The edge of the former is quite sharp. People who care a lot about
their work are usually very sensitive to the difference between
pulling, and being pushed, and work tends to fall into one category
or the other. But the test isn&#39;t simply whether you&#39;re told to do
something. You can choose to do something you&#39;re told to do. Indeed,
you can own it far more thoroughly than the person who told you to
do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, math homework is for most people something they&#39;re
told to do. But for my father, who was a mathematician, it wasn&#39;t.
Most of us think of the problems in a math book as a way to test
or develop our knowledge of the material explained in each section.
But to my father the problems were the part that mattered, and the
text was merely a sort of annotation. Whenever he got a new math
book it was to him like being given a puzzle: here was a new set
of problems to solve, and he&#39;d immediately set about solving all
of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other sense of a project being one&#39;s own — working on it by
oneself — has a much softer edge. It shades gradually into
collaboration. And interestingly, it shades into collaboration in
two different ways. One way to collaborate is to share a single
project. For example, when two mathematicians collaborate on a proof
that takes shape in the course of a conversation between them. The
other way is when multiple people work on separate projects of their
own that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. For example, when one
person writes the text of a book and another does the graphic design.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/own.html#f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These two paths into collaboration can of course be combined. But
under the right conditions, the excitement of working on a project
of one&#39;s own can be preserved for quite a while before disintegrating
into the turbulent flow of work in a large organization. Indeed,
the history of successful organizations is partly the history of
techniques for preserving that excitement.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/own.html#f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The team that made the original Macintosh were a great example of
this phenomenon. People like Burrell Smith and Andy Hertzfeld and
Bill Atkinson and Susan Kare were not just following orders. They
were not tennis balls hit by Steve Jobs, but rockets let loose by
Steve Jobs. There was a lot of collaboration between them, but
they all seem to have individually felt the excitement of
working on a project of one&#39;s own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Andy Hertzfeld&#39;s book on the Macintosh, he describes how they&#39;d
come back into the office after dinner and work late into the night.
People who&#39;ve never experienced the thrill of working on a project
they&#39;re excited about can&#39;t distinguish this kind of working long
hours from the kind that happens in sweatshops and boiler rooms,
but they&#39;re at opposite ends of the spectrum. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a
mistake to insist dogmatically on &quot;work/life balance.&quot; Indeed, the
mere expression &quot;work/life&quot; embodies a mistake: it assumes work and
life are distinct. For those to whom the word &quot;work&quot; automatically
implies the dutiful plodding kind, they are. But for the skaters,
the relationship between work and life would be better represented
by a dash than a slash. I wouldn&#39;t want to work on anything that I didn&#39;t
want to take over my life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, it&#39;s easier to achieve this level of motivation when
you&#39;re making something like the Macintosh. It&#39;s easy for something
new to feel like a project of your own. That&#39;s one of the reasons
for the tendency programmers have to rewrite things that don&#39;t need
rewriting, and to write their own versions of things that already
exist. This sometimes alarms managers, and measured by total number
of characters typed, it&#39;s rarely the optimal solution. But it&#39;s not
always driven simply by arrogance or cluelessness.
Writing code from scratch is also much more rewarding — so much
more rewarding that a good programmer can end up net ahead, despite
the shocking waste of characters. Indeed, it may be one of the
advantages of capitalism that it encourages such rewriting. A company
that needs software to do something can&#39;t use the software already
written to do it at another company, and thus has to write their
own, which often turns out better.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/own.html#f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The natural alignment between skating and solving new problems is
one of the reasons the payoffs from startups are so high. Not only
is the market price of unsolved problems higher, you also get a
discount on productivity when you work on them. In fact, you get a
double increase in productivity: when you&#39;re doing a clean-sheet
design, it&#39;s easier to recruit skaters, and they get to spend all
their time skating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Steve Jobs knew a thing or two about skaters from having watched
Steve Wozniak. If you can find the right people, you only have to
tell them what to do at the highest level. They&#39;ll handle the
details. Indeed, they insist on it. For a project to feel like your
own, you must have sufficient autonomy. You can&#39;t be working to
order, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/artistsship.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;slowed down&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
by bureaucracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One way to ensure autonomy is not to have a boss at all. There are
two ways to do that: to be the boss yourself, and to work on projects
outside of work. Though they&#39;re at opposite ends of the scale
financially, startups and open source projects have a lot in common,
including the fact that they&#39;re often run by skaters. And indeed,
there&#39;s a wormhole from one end of the scale to the other: one of
the best ways to discover 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;startup ideas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is to work on a project
just for fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your projects are the kind that make money, it&#39;s easy to work
on them. It&#39;s harder when they&#39;re not. And the hardest part, usually,
is morale. That&#39;s where adults have it harder than kids. Kids just
plunge in and build their treehouse without worrying about whether
they&#39;re wasting their time, or how it compares to other treehouses.
And frankly we could learn a lot from kids here. The high standards
most grownups have for &quot;real&quot; work do not always serve us well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most important phase in a project of one&#39;s own is at the
beginning: when you go from thinking it might be cool to do x to
actually doing x. And at that point high standards are not merely
useless but positively harmful. There are a few people who start
too many new projects, but far more, I suspect, who are deterred
by fear of failure from starting projects that would have succeeded
if they had.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But if we couldn&#39;t benefit as kids from the knowledge that our
treehouses were on the path to grownup projects, we can at least
benefit as grownups from knowing that our projects are on a path
that stretches back to treehouses. Remember that careless confidence
you had as a kid when starting something new? That would be a
powerful thing to recapture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it&#39;s harder as adults to retain that kind of confidence, we at
least tend to be more aware of what we&#39;re doing. Kids bounce, or
are herded, from one kind of work to the next, barely realizing
what&#39;s happening to them. Whereas we know more about different types
of work and have more control over which we do. Ideally we can have
the best of both worlds: to be deliberate in choosing to work on
projects of our own, and carelessly confident in starting new ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
&quot;Hobby&quot; is a curious word. Now it means work that isn&#39;t &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt;
work — work that one is not to be judged by — but originally it just
meant an obsession in a fairly general sense (even a political
opinion, for example) that one metaphorically rode as a child rides
a hobby-horse. It&#39;s hard to say if its recent, narrower meaning is
a change for the better or the worse. For sure there are lots of
false positives — lots of projects that end up being important but
are dismissed initially as mere hobbies. But on the other hand, the
concept provides valuable cover for projects in the early, ugly
duckling phase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Tiger parents, as parents so often do, are fighting the last
war. Grades mattered more in the old days when the route to success
was to acquire 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/credentials.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;credentials&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
while ascending some predefined ladder.
But it&#39;s just as well that their tactics are focused on grades. How
awful it would be if they invaded the territory of projects, and
thereby gave their kids a distaste for this kind of work by forcing
them to do it. Grades are already a grim, fake world, and aren&#39;t
harmed much by parental interference, but working on one&#39;s own
projects is a more delicate, private thing that could be damaged
very easily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The complicated, gradual edge between working on one&#39;s own
projects and collaborating with others is one reason there is so
much disagreement about the idea of the &quot;lone genius.&quot; In practice
people collaborate (or not) in all kinds of different ways, but the
idea of the lone genius is definitely not a myth. There&#39;s a core
of truth to it that goes with a certain way of working.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Collaboration is powerful too. The optimal organization would
combine collaboration and ownership in such a way as to do the least
damage to each. Interestingly, companies and university departments
approach this ideal from opposite directions: companies insist on
collaboration, and occasionally also manage both to recruit skaters
and allow them to skate, and university departments insist on the
ability to do independent research (which is by custom treated as
skating, whether it is or not), and the people they hire collaborate
as much as they choose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
If a company could design its software in such a way that the
best newly arrived programmers always got a clean sheet, it could
have a kind of eternal youth. That might not be impossible. If you
had a software backbone defining a game with sufficiently clear
rules, individual programmers could write their own players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In ordinary
social situations they are — as quiet and diffident as the star
quarterback would be if he found himself in the middle of a physics
symposium. And for the same reason: they are fish out of water.
But the apparent diffidence of nerds is an illusion due to the fact
that when non-nerds observe them, it&#39;s usually in ordinary social
situations. In fact some nerds are quite fierce.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fierce nerds are a small but interesting group. They are as a
rule extremely competitive — more competitive, I&#39;d say, than highly
competitive non-nerds. Competition is more personal for them. Partly
perhaps because they&#39;re not emotionally mature enough to distance
themselves from it, but also because there&#39;s less randomness in the
kinds of competition they engage in, and they are thus more justified
in taking the results personally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fierce nerds also tend to be somewhat overconfident, especially
when young. It might seem like it would be a disadvantage to be
mistaken about one&#39;s abilities, but empirically it isn&#39;t. Up to a
point, confidence is a self-fullfilling prophecy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another quality you find in most fierce nerds is intelligence. Not
all nerds are smart, but the fierce ones are always at least
moderately so. If they weren&#39;t, they wouldn&#39;t have the confidence
to be fierce.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/fn.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s also a natural connection between nerdiness and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/think.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;independent-mindedness&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s hard to be 
independent-minded without
being somewhat socially awkward, because conventional beliefs are
so often mistaken, or at least arbitrary. No one who was both
independent-minded and ambitious would want to waste the effort it
takes to fit in. And the independent-mindedness of the fierce nerds
will obviously be of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/conformism.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;aggressive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
rather than the passive type:
they&#39;ll be annoyed by rules, rather than dreamily unaware of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m less sure why fierce nerds are impatient, but most seem to be.
You notice it first in conversation, where they tend to interrupt
you. This is merely annoying, but in the more promising fierce nerds
it&#39;s connected to a deeper impatience about solving problems. Perhaps
the competitiveness and impatience of fierce nerds are not separate 
qualities, but two manifestations of a single underlying drivenness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you combine all these qualities in sufficient quantities, the
result is quite formidable. The most vivid example of fierce nerds
in action may be James Watson&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Double Helix&lt;/i&gt;. The first sentence
of the book is &quot;I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood,&quot;
and the portrait he goes on to paint of Crick is the quintessential
fierce nerd: brilliant, socially awkward, competitive, independent-minded,
overconfident. But so is the implicit portrait he paints of himself.
Indeed, his lack of social awareness makes both portraits that much
more realistic, because he baldly states all sorts of opinions and
motivations that a smoother person would conceal. And moreover it&#39;s
clear from the story that Crick and Watson&#39;s fierce nerdiness was
integral to their success. Their independent-mindedness caused them
to consider approaches that most others ignored, their overconfidence
allowed them to work on problems they only half understood (they
were literally described as &quot;clowns&quot; by one eminent insider), and
their impatience and competitiveness got them to the answer ahead
of two other groups that would otherwise have found it within the
next year, if not the next several months.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/fn.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The idea that there could be fierce nerds is an unfamiliar one not
just to many normal people but even to some young nerds. Especially
early on, nerds spend so much of their time in ordinary social
situations and so little doing real work that they get a lot more
evidence of their awkwardness than their power. So there will be
some who read this description of the fierce nerd and realize &quot;Hmm,
that&#39;s me.&quot; And it is to you, young fierce nerd, that I now turn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have some good news, and some bad news. The good news is that
your fierceness will be a great help in solving difficult problems.
And not just the kind of scientific and technical problems that
nerds have traditionally solved. As the world progresses, the number
of things you can win at by getting the right answer increases.
Recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/richnow.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;getting rich&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; became 
one of them: 7 of the 8 richest people
in America are now fierce nerds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, being a fierce nerd is probably even more helpful in business
than in nerds&#39; original territory of scholarship. Fierceness seems
optional there. Darwin for example doesn&#39;t seem to have been
especially fierce. Whereas it&#39;s impossible to be the CEO of a company
over a certain size without being fierce, so now that nerds can win
at business, fierce nerds will increasingly monopolize the really
big successes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bad news is that if it&#39;s not exercised, your fierceness will
turn to bitterness, and you will become an intellectual playground
bully: the grumpy sysadmin, the forum troll, the 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/fh.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;hater&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the shooter
down of &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/newideas.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;new ideas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do you avoid this fate? Work on ambitious projects. If you
succeed, it will bring you a kind of satisfaction that neutralizes
bitterness. But you don&#39;t need to have succeeded to feel this;
merely working on hard projects gives most fierce nerds some
feeling of satisfaction. And those it doesn&#39;t, it at least keeps
busy.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/fn.html#f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another solution may be to somehow turn off your fierceness, by
devoting yourself to meditation or psychotherapy or something like
that. Maybe that&#39;s the right answer for some people. I have no idea.
But it doesn&#39;t seem the optimal solution to me. If you&#39;re given a
sharp knife, it seems to me better to use it than to blunt its edge
to avoid cutting yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you do choose the ambitious route, you&#39;ll have a tailwind behind
you. There has never been a better time to be a nerd. In the past
century we&#39;ve seen a continuous transfer of power from dealmakers
to technicians — from the charismatic to the competent — and I
don&#39;t see anything on the horizon that will end it. At least not
till the nerds end it themselves by bringing about the singularity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
To be a nerd is to be socially awkward, and there are two
distinct ways to do that: to be playing the same game as everyone
else, but badly, and to be playing a different game. The smart nerds
are the latter type.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The same qualities that make fierce nerds so effective can
also make them very annoying. Fierce nerds would do well to remember
this, and (a) try to keep a lid on it, and (b) seek out organizations
and types of work where getting the right answer matters more than
preserving social harmony. In practice that means small groups
working on hard problems. Which fortunately is the most fun kind
of environment anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
If success neutralizes bitterness, why are there some people
who are at least moderately successful and yet still quite bitter?
Because people&#39;s potential bitterness varies depending on how
naturally bitter their personality is, and how ambitious they are:
someone who&#39;s naturally very bitter will still have a lot left after
success neutralizes some of it, and someone who&#39;s very ambitious
will need proportionally more success to satisfy that ambition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the worst-case scenario is someone who&#39;s both naturally bitter
and extremely ambitious, and yet only moderately successful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

If someone I knew to be both a domain expert and a reasonable person
proposed an idea that sounded preposterous, I&#39;d be very reluctant
to say &quot;That will never work.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone who has studied the history of ideas, and especially the
history of science, knows that&#39;s how big things start. Someone
proposes an idea that sounds crazy, most people dismiss it, then
it gradually takes over the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most implausible-sounding ideas are in fact bad and could be safely
dismissed. But not when they&#39;re proposed by reasonable domain
experts. If the person proposing the idea is reasonable, then they
know how implausible it sounds. And yet they&#39;re proposing it anyway.
That suggests they know something you don&#39;t. And if they have deep
domain expertise, that&#39;s probably the source of it.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/newideas.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such ideas are not merely unsafe to dismiss, but disproportionately
likely to be interesting. When the average person proposes an
implausible-sounding idea, its implausibility is evidence of their
incompetence. But when a reasonable domain expert does it, the
situation is reversed. There&#39;s something like an efficient market
here: on average the ideas that seem craziest will, if correct,
have the biggest effect. So if you can eliminate the theory that
the person proposing an implausible-sounding idea is incompetent,
its implausibility switches from evidence that it&#39;s boring to
evidence that it&#39;s exciting.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/newideas.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such ideas are not guaranteed to work. But they don&#39;t have to be.
They just have to be sufficiently good bets — to have sufficiently
high expected value. And I think on average they do. I think if you
bet on the entire set of implausible-sounding ideas proposed by
reasonable domain experts, you&#39;d end up net ahead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason is that everyone is too conservative. The word &quot;paradigm&quot;
is overused, but this is a case where it&#39;s warranted. Everyone is
too much in the grip of the current paradigm. Even the people who
have the new ideas undervalue them initially. Which means that
before they reach the stage of proposing them publicly, they&#39;ve
already subjected them to an excessively strict filter.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/newideas.html#f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The wise response to such an idea is not to make statements, but
to ask questions, because there&#39;s a real mystery here. Why has this
smart and reasonable person proposed an idea that seems so wrong?
Are they mistaken, or are you? One of you has to be. If you&#39;re the
one who&#39;s mistaken, that would be good to know, because it means
there&#39;s a hole in your model of the world. But even if they&#39;re
mistaken, it should be interesting to learn why. A trap that an
expert falls into is one you have to worry about too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This all seems pretty obvious. And yet there are clearly a lot of
people who don&#39;t share my fear of dismissing new ideas. Why do they
do it? Why risk looking like a jerk now and a fool later, instead
of just reserving judgement?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One reason they do it is envy. If you propose a radical new idea
and it succeeds, your reputation (and perhaps also your wealth)
will increase proportionally. Some people would be envious if that
happened, and this potential envy propagates back into a conviction
that you must be wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another reason people dismiss new ideas is that it&#39;s an easy way
to seem sophisticated. When a new idea first emerges, it usually
seems pretty feeble. It&#39;s a mere hatchling. Received wisdom is a
full-grown eagle by comparison. So it&#39;s easy to launch a devastating
attack on a new idea, and anyone who does will seem clever to those
who don&#39;t understand this asymmetry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This phenomenon is exacerbated by the difference between how those
working on new ideas and those attacking them are rewarded. The
rewards for working on new ideas are weighted by the value of the
outcome. So it&#39;s worth working on something that only has a 10%
chance of succeeding if it would make things more than 10x better.
Whereas the rewards for attacking new ideas are roughly constant;
such attacks seem roughly equally clever regardless of the target.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People will also attack new ideas when they have a vested interest
in the old ones. It&#39;s not surprising, for example, that some of
Darwin&#39;s harshest critics were churchmen. People build whole careers
on some ideas. When someone claims they&#39;re false or obsolete, they
feel threatened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lowest form of dismissal is mere factionalism: to automatically
dismiss any idea associated with the opposing faction. The lowest
form of all is to dismiss an idea because of who proposed it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the main thing that leads reasonable people to dismiss new ideas
is the same thing that holds people back from proposing them: the
sheer pervasiveness of the current paradigm. It doesn&#39;t just affect
the way we think; it is the Lego blocks we build thoughts out of.
Popping out of the current paradigm is something only a few people
can do. And even they usually have to suppress their intuitions at
first, like a pilot flying through cloud who has to trust his
instruments over his sense of balance.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/newideas.html#f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paradigms don&#39;t just define our present thinking. They also vacuum
up the trail of crumbs that led to them, making our standards for
new ideas impossibly high. The current paradigm seems so perfect
to us, its offspring, that we imagine it must have been accepted
completely as soon as it was discovered — that whatever the church thought
of the heliocentric model, astronomers must have been convinced as
soon as Copernicus proposed it. Far, in fact, from it. Copernicus
published the heliocentric model in 1532, but it wasn&#39;t till the
mid seventeenth century that the balance of scientific opinion
shifted in its favor.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/newideas.html#f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Few understand how feeble new ideas look when they first appear.
So if you want to have new ideas yourself, one of the most valuable
things you can do is to learn what they look like when they&#39;re born.
Read about how new ideas happened, and try to get yourself into the
heads of people at the time. How did things look to them, when the
new idea was only half-finished, and even the person who had it was
only half-convinced it was right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But you don&#39;t have to stop at history. You can observe big new ideas
being born all around you right now. Just look for a reasonable
domain expert proposing something that sounds wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&#39;re nice, as well as wise, you won&#39;t merely resist attacking
such people, but encourage them. Having new ideas is a lonely
business. Only those who&#39;ve tried it know how lonely. These people
need your help. And if you help them, you&#39;ll probably learn something
in the process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
This domain expertise could be in another field. Indeed,
such crossovers tend to be particularly promising.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
I&#39;m not claiming this principle extends much beyond math,
engineering, and the hard sciences. In politics, for example,
crazy-sounding ideas generally are as bad as they sound. Though
arguably this is not an exception, because the people who propose
them are not in fact domain experts; politicians are domain experts
in political tactics, like how to get elected and how to get
legislation passed, but not in the world that policy acts upon.
Perhaps no one could be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
This sense of &quot;paradigm&quot; was defined by Thomas Kuhn in his
&lt;i&gt;Structure of Scientific Revolutions&lt;/i&gt;, but I also recommend his
&lt;i&gt;Copernican Revolution&lt;/i&gt;, where you can see him at work developing the
idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
This is one reason people with a touch of Asperger&#39;s may have
an advantage in discovering new ideas. They&#39;re always flying on
instruments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]

supported for years, just launched
a new NFT. It has a dramatic name, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/NooraNFT&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Save Thousands of Lives&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
because that&#39;s what the proceeds will do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Noora has been saving lives for 7 years. They run programs in
hospitals in South Asia to teach new mothers how to take care of
their babies once they get home. They&#39;re in 165 hospitals now. And
because they know the numbers before and after they start at a new
hospital, they can measure the impact they have. It is massive.
For every 1000 live births, they save 9 babies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This number comes from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/NFT-research&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
of 133,733 families at 28 different
hospitals that Noora conducted in collaboration with the Better
Birth team at Ariadne Labs, a joint center for health systems
innovation at Brigham and Women�s Hospital and Harvard T.H. Chan
School of Public Health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Noora is so effective that even if you measure their costs in the
most conservative way, by dividing their entire budget by the number
of lives saved, the cost of saving a life is the lowest I&#39;ve seen.
$1,235.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For this NFT, they&#39;re going to issue a public report tracking how
this specific tranche of money is spent, and estimating the number
of lives saved as a result.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NFTs are a new territory, and this way of using them is especially
new, but I&#39;m excited about its potential. And I&#39;m excited to see
what happens with this particular auction, because unlike an NFT
representing something that has already happened,
this NFT gets better as the price gets higher.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reserve price was about $2.5 million, because that&#39;s what it
takes for the name to be accurate: that&#39;s what it costs to save
2000 lives. But the higher the price of this NFT goes, the more
lives will be saved.

things like whether it&#39;s permissible for the state to take someone&#39;s
life, whether the death penalty acts as a deterrent, and whether
more death sentences are given to some groups than others. But in
practice the debate about the death penalty is not about whether
it&#39;s ok to kill murderers. It&#39;s about whether it&#39;s ok to kill
innocent people, because at least 4% of people on death row are
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7230&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;innocent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I was a kid I imagined that it was unusual for people to be
convicted of crimes they hadn&#39;t committed, and that in murder cases
especially this must be very rare. Far from it. Now, thanks to
organizations like the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://innocenceproject.org/all-cases&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Innocence Project&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
we see a constant stream
of stories about murder convictions being overturned after new
evidence emerges. Sometimes the police and prosecutors were just
very sloppy. Sometimes they were crooked, and knew full well they
were convicting an innocent person.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kenneth Adams and three other men spent 18 years in prison on a
murder conviction. They were exonerated after DNA testing implicated
three different men, two of whom later confessed. The police had
been told about the other men early in the investigation, but never
followed up the lead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keith Harward spent 33 years in prison on a murder conviction. He
was convicted because &quot;experts&quot; said his teeth matched photos of
bite marks on one victim. He was exonerated after DNA testing showed
the murder had been committed by another man, Jerry Crotty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ricky Jackson and two other men spent 39 years in prison after being
convicted of murder on the testimony of a 12 year old boy, who later
recanted and said he&#39;d been coerced by police. Multiple people have
confirmed the boy was elsewhere at the time. The three men were
exonerated after the county prosecutor dropped the charges, saying
&quot;The state is conceding the obvious.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alfred Brown spent 12 years in prison on a murder conviction,
including 10 years on death row. He was exonerated after it was
discovered that the assistant district attorney had concealed phone
records proving he could not have committed the crimes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Glenn Ford spent 29 years on death row after having been convicted
of murder. He was exonerated after new evidence proved he was not
even at the scene when the murder occurred. The attorneys assigned
to represent him had never tried a jury case before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cameron Willingham was actually executed in 2004 by lethal injection.
The &quot;expert&quot; who testified that he deliberately set fire to his
house has since been discredited. A re-examination of the case
ordered by the state of Texas in 2009 concluded that &quot;a finding of
arson could not be sustained.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://saverichardglossip.com/facts&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rich Glossip&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
has spent 20 years on death row after being convicted
of murder on the testimony of the actual killer, who escaped with
a life sentence in return for implicating him. In 2015 he came
within minutes of execution before it emerged that Oklahoma had
been planning to kill him with an illegal combination of drugs.
They still plan to go ahead with the execution, perhaps as soon as
this summer, despite 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/oklahoma/articles/2020-10-14/attorney-for-oklahoma-death-row-inmate-claims-new-evidence&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;new 
evidence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; exonerating him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I could go on. There are hundreds of similar cases. In Florida
alone, 29 death row prisoners have been exonerated so far.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Far from being rare, wrongful murder convictions are 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/innocence/description-of-innocence-cases&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;very common&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Police are under pressure to solve a crime that has gotten a lot
of attention. When they find a suspect, they want to believe he&#39;s
guilty, and ignore or even destroy evidence suggesting otherwise.
District attorneys want to be seen as effective and tough on crime,
and in order to win convictions are willing to manipulate witnesses
and withhold evidence. Court-appointed defense attorneys are
overworked and often incompetent. There&#39;s a ready supply of criminals
willing to give false testimony in return for a lighter sentence,
suggestible witnesses who can be made to say whatever police want,
and bogus &quot;experts&quot; eager to claim that science proves the defendant
is guilty. And juries want to believe them, since otherwise some
terrible crime remains unsolved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This circus of incompetence and dishonesty is the real issue with
the death penalty. We don&#39;t even reach the point where theoretical
questions about the moral justification or effectiveness of capital
punishment start to matter, because so many of the people sentenced
to death are actually innocent. Whatever it means in theory, in

richest Americans. If we compare the 100 richest people in 1982 to
the 100 richest in 2020, we notice some big differences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1982 the most common source of wealth was inheritance. Of the
100 richest people, 60 inherited from an ancestor. There were 10
du Pont heirs alone. By 2020 the number of heirs had been cut in
half, accounting for only 27 of the biggest 100 fortunes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why would the percentage of heirs decrease? Not because inheritance
taxes increased. In fact, they decreased significantly during this
period. The reason the percentage of heirs has decreased is not
that fewer people are inheriting great fortunes, but that more
people are making them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How are people making these new fortunes? Roughly 3/4 by starting
companies and 1/4 by investing. Of the 73 new fortunes in 2020, 56
derive from founders&#39; or early employees&#39; equity (52 founders, 2
early employees, and 2 wives of founders), and 17 from managing
investment funds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were no fund managers among the 100 richest Americans in 1982.
Hedge funds and private equity firms existed in 1982, but none of
their founders were rich enough yet to make it into the top 100.
Two things changed: fund managers discovered new ways to generate
high returns, and more investors were willing to trust them with
their money.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/richnow.html#f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the main source of new fortunes now is starting companies, and
when you look at the data, you see big changes there too. People
get richer from starting companies now than they did in 1982, because
the companies do different things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1982, there were two dominant sources of new wealth: oil and
real estate. Of the 40 new fortunes in 1982, at least 24 were due
primarily to oil or real estate. Now only a small number are: of
the 73 new fortunes in 2020, 4 were due to real estate and only 2
to oil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By 2020 the biggest source of new wealth was what are sometimes
called &quot;tech&quot; companies. Of the 73 new fortunes, about 30 derive
from such companies. These are particularly common among the richest
of the rich: 8 of the top 10 fortunes in 2020 were new fortunes of
this type.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arguably it&#39;s slightly misleading to treat tech as a category.
Isn&#39;t Amazon really a retailer, and Tesla a car maker? Yes and no.
Maybe in 50 years, when what we call tech is taken for granted, it
won&#39;t seem right to put these two businesses in the same category.
But at the moment at least, there is definitely something they share
in common that distinguishes them. What retailer starts AWS? What
car maker is run by someone who also has a rocket company?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tech companies behind the top 100 fortunes also form a
well-differentiated group in the sense that they&#39;re all companies
that venture capitalists would readily invest in, and the others
mostly not. And there&#39;s a reason why: these are mostly companies
that win by having better technology, rather than just a CEO who&#39;s
really driven and good at making deals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To that extent, the rise of the tech companies represents a qualitative
change. The oil and real estate magnates of the 1982 Forbes 400
didn&#39;t win by making better technology. They won by being really
driven and good at making deals. 
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/richnow.html#f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;
And indeed, that way of
getting rich is so old that it predates the Industrial Revolution.
The courtiers who got rich in the (nominal) service of European
royal houses in the 16th and 17th centuries were also, as a rule,
really driven and good at making deals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People who don&#39;t look any deeper than the Gini coefficient look
back on the world of 1982 as the good old days, because those who
got rich then didn&#39;t get as rich. But if you dig into &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; they
got rich, the old days don&#39;t look so good. In 1982, 84% of the
richest 100 people got rich by inheritance, extracting natural
resources, or doing real estate deals. Is that really better than
a world in which the richest people get rich by starting tech
companies?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why are people starting so many more new companies than they used
to, and why are they getting so rich from it? The answer to the
first question, curiously enough, is that it&#39;s misphrased. We
shouldn&#39;t be asking why people are starting companies, but why
they&#39;re starting companies &lt;i&gt;again&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/richnow.html#f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1892, the &lt;i&gt;New York Herald Tribune&lt;/i&gt; compiled a list of all the
millionaires in America. They found 4047 of them. How many had
inherited their wealth then? Only about 20%, which is less than the
proportion of heirs today. And when you investigate the sources of
the new fortunes, 1892 looks even more like today. Hugh Rockoff
found that &quot;many of the richest ... gained their initial edge from
the new technology of mass production.&quot;
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/richnow.html#f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So it&#39;s not 2020 that&#39;s the anomaly here, but 1982. The real question
is why so few people had gotten rich from starting companies in
1982. And the answer is that even as the &lt;i&gt;Herald Tribune&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s list was
being compiled, a wave of &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/re.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consolidation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
was sweeping through the
American economy. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
financiers like J. P. Morgan combined thousands of smaller companies
into a few hundred giant ones with commanding economies of scale.
By the end of World War II, as Michael Lind writes, &quot;the major
sectors of the economy were either organized as government-backed
cartels or dominated by a few oligopolistic corporations.&quot;
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/richnow.html#f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1960, most of the people who start startups today would have
gone to work for one of them. You could get rich from starting your
own company in 1890 and in 2020, but in 1960 it was not really a
viable option. You couldn&#39;t break through the oligopolies to get
at the markets. So the prestigious route in 1960 was not to start
your own company, but to work your way up the corporate ladder at
an existing one.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/richnow.html#f6n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Making everyone a corporate employee decreased economic inequality
(and every other kind of variation), but if your model of normal
is the mid 20th century, you have a very misleading model in that
respect. J. P. Morgan&#39;s economy turned out to be just a phase, and
starting in the 1970s, it began to break up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why did it break up? Partly senescence. The big companies that
seemed models of scale and efficiency in 1930 had by 1970 become
slack and bloated. By 1970 the rigid structure of the economy was
full of cosy nests that various groups had built to insulate
themselves from market forces. During the Carter administration the
federal government realized something was amiss and began, in a
process they called &quot;deregulation,&quot; to roll back the policies that
propped up the oligopolies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it wasn&#39;t just decay from within that broke up J. P. Morgan&#39;s
economy. There was also pressure from without, in the form of new
technology, and particularly microelectronics. The best way to
envision what happened is to imagine a pond with a crust of ice on
top. Initially the only way from the bottom to the surface is around
the edges. But as the ice crust weakens, you start to be able to
punch right through the middle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The edges of the pond were pure tech: companies that actually
described themselves as being in the electronics or software business.
When you used the word &quot;startup&quot; in 1990, that was what you meant.
But now startups are punching right through the middle of the ice
crust and displacing incumbents like retailers and TV networks and
car companies.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/richnow.html#f7n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But though the breakup of J. P. Morgan&#39;s economy created a new world
in the technological sense, it was a reversion to the norm in the
social sense. If you only look back as far as the mid 20th century,
it seems like people getting rich by starting their own companies
is a recent phenomenon. But if you look back further, you realize
it&#39;s actually the default. So what we should expect in the future
is more of the same. Indeed, we should expect both the number and
wealth of founders to grow, because every decade it gets easier to
start a startup.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part of the reason it&#39;s getting easier to start a startup is social.
Society is (re)assimilating the concept. If you start one now, your
parents won&#39;t freak out the way they would have a generation ago,
and knowledge about how to do it is much more widespread. But the
main reason it&#39;s easier to start a startup now is that it&#39;s cheaper.
Technology has driven down the cost of both building products and
acquiring customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The decreasing cost of starting a startup has in turn changed the
balance of power between founders and investors. Back when starting
a startup meant building a factory, you needed investors&#39; permission
to do it at all. But now investors need founders more than founders
need investors, and that, combined with the increasing amount of
venture capital available, has driven up valuations.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/richnow.html#f8n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the decreasing cost of starting a startup increases the number
of rich people in two ways: it means that more people start them,
and that those who do can raise money on better terms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there&#39;s also a third factor at work: the companies themselves
are more valuable, because newly founded companies grow faster than
they used to. Technology hasn&#39;t just made it cheaper to build and
distribute things, but faster too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This trend has been running for a long time. IBM, founded in 1896,
took 45 years to reach a billion 2020 dollars in revenue.
Hewlett-Packard, founded in 1939, took 25 years. Microsoft, founded
in 1975, took 13 years. Now the norm for fast-growing companies is
7 or 8 years.
&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/richnow.html#f9n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#dddddd&quot;&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fast growth has a double effect on the value of founders&#39; stock.
The value of a company is a function of its revenue and its growth
rate. So if a company grows faster, you not only get to a billion
dollars in revenue sooner, but the company is more valuable when
it reaches that point than it would be if it were growing slower.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s why founders sometimes get so rich so young now. The low
initial cost of starting a startup means founders can start young,
and the fast growth of companies today means that if they succeed
they could be surprisingly rich just a few years later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s easier now to start and grow a company than it has ever been.
That means more people start them, that those who do get better
terms from investors, and that the resulting companies become more
valuable. Once you understand how these mechanisms work, and that
startups were suppressed for most of the 20th century, you don&#39;t
have to resort to some vague right turn the country took under
Reagan to explain why America&#39;s Gini coefficient is increasing. Of
course the Gini coefficient is increasing. With more people starting
more valuable companies, how could it not be?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f1n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Investment firms grew rapidly after a regulatory change by
the Labor Department in 1978 allowed pension funds to invest in
them, but the effects of this growth were not yet visible in the
top 100 fortunes in 1982.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f2n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
George Mitchell deserves mention as an exception. Though
really driven and good at making deals, he was also the first to
figure out how to use fracking to get natural gas out of shale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f3n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
When I say people are starting more companies, I mean the
type of company meant to &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/growth.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;grow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
very big. There has actually been a
decrease in the last couple decades in the overall number of new
companies. But the vast majority of companies are small retail and
service businesses. So what the statistics about the decreasing
number of new businesses mean is that people are starting fewer
shoe stores and barber shops.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People sometimes get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/magazine/201505/leigh-buchanan/the-vanishing-startups-in-decline.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;confused&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when they see a graph labelled
&quot;startups&quot; that&#39;s going down, because there are two senses of the
word &quot;startup&quot;: (1) the founding of a company, and (2) a particular
type of company designed to grow big fast. The statistics mean
startup in sense (1), not sense (2).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f4n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]

Paper 14555, 2008.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f5n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Lind, Michael. &lt;i&gt;Land of Promise.&lt;/i&gt; HarperCollins, 2012.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s also likely that the high tax rates in the mid 20th century
deterred people from starting their own companies. Starting one&#39;s
own company is risky, and when risk isn&#39;t rewarded, people opt for
&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/inequality.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;safety&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it wasn&#39;t simply cause and effect. The oligopolies and high tax
rates of the mid 20th century were all of a piece. Lower taxes are
not just a cause of entrepreneurship, but an effect as well: the
people getting rich in the mid 20th century from real estate and
oil exploration lobbied for and got huge tax loopholes that made
their effective tax rate much lower, and presumably if it had been
more common to grow big companies by building new technology, the
people doing that would have lobbied for their own loopholes as
well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f6n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;6&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
That&#39;s why the people who did get rich in the mid 20th century
so often got rich from oil exploration or real estate. Those were
the two big areas of the economy that weren&#39;t susceptible to
consolidation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f7n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;7&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
The pure tech companies used to be called &quot;high technology&quot; startups.
But now that startups can punch through the middle of the ice crust,
we don&#39;t need a separate name for the edges, and the term &quot;high-tech&quot;
has a decidedly &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=high+tech&amp;amp;year_start=1900&amp;amp;year_end=2019&amp;amp;corpus=en-2019&amp;amp;smoothing=3&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;retro&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
sound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f8n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
Higher valuations mean you either sell less stock to get a
given amount of money, or get more money for a given amount of
stock. The typical startup does some of each. Obviously you end up
richer if you keep more stock, but you should also end up richer
if you raise more money, because (a) it should make the company
more successful, and (b) you should be able to last longer before
the next round, or not even need one. Notice all those shoulds
though. In practice a lot of money slips through them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It might seem that the huge rounds raised by startups nowadays
contradict the claim that it has become cheaper to start one. But
there&#39;s no contradiction here; the startups that raise the most are
the ones doing it by choice, in order to grow faster, not the ones
doing it because they need the money to survive. There&#39;s nothing
like not needing money to make people offer it to you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You would think, after having been on the side of labor in its fight
with capital for almost two centuries, that the far left would be
happy that labor has finally prevailed. But none of them seem to
be. You can almost hear them saying &quot;No, no, not &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; way.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;f9n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;9&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]
IBM was created in 1911 by merging three companies, the most
important of which was Herman Hollerith&#39;s Tabulating Machine Company,
founded in 1896. In 1941 its revenues were $60 million.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hewlett-Packard&#39;s revenues in 1964 were $125 million.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Microsoft&#39;s revenues in 1988 were $590 million.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks&lt;/b&gt; to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, Bob Lesko, Robert Morris,

Up to that point I
felt about kids the way the young Augustine felt about living
virtuously. I&#39;d have been sad to think I&#39;d never have children.
But did I want them now? No.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I had kids, I&#39;d become a parent, and parents, as I&#39;d known since
I was a kid, were uncool. They were dull and responsible and had
no fun.  And while it&#39;s not surprising that kids would believe that,
to be honest I hadn&#39;t seen much as an adult to change my mind.
Whenever I&#39;d noticed parents with kids, the kids seemed to be
terrors, and the parents pathetic harried creatures, even when they
prevailed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When people had babies, I congratulated them enthusiastically,
because that seemed to be what one did. But I didn&#39;t feel it at
all.  &quot;Better you than me,&quot; I was thinking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now when people have babies I congratulate them enthusiastically and
I mean it. Especially the first one. I feel like they just got the best gift in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What changed, of course, is that I had kids. Something I dreaded
turned out to be wonderful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Partly, and I won&#39;t deny it, this is because of serious chemical
changes that happened almost instantly when our first child was
born.  It was like someone flipped a switch. I suddenly felt
protective not just toward our child, but toward all children. As I was
driving my wife and new son home from the hospital, I approached a
crosswalk full of pedestrians, and I found myself thinking &quot;I have
to be really careful of all these people. Every one of them is
someone&#39;s child!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So to some extent you can&#39;t trust me when I say having kids is
great.  To some extent I&#39;m like a religious cultist telling you
that you&#39;ll be happy if you join the cult too � but only because
joining the cult will alter your mind in a way that will make you
happy to be a cult member.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But not entirely. There were some things
about having kids that I clearly got wrong before I had them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, there was a huge amount of selection bias in my
observations of parents and children. Some parents may have noticed
that I wrote &quot;Whenever I&#39;d noticed parents with kids.&quot; Of course
the times I noticed kids were when things were going wrong. I only
noticed them when they made noise. And where was I when I noticed
them?  Ordinarily I never went to places with kids, so the only
times I encountered them were in shared bottlenecks like airplanes.
Which is not exactly a representative sample. Flying with a toddler
is something very few parents enjoy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I didn&#39;t notice, because they tend to be much quieter, were
all the great moments parents had with kids. People don&#39;t talk about
these much � the magic is hard to put into words, and all other
parents know about them anyway � but one of the great things about
having kids is that there are so many times when you feel there is
nowhere else you&#39;d rather be, and nothing else you&#39;d rather be
doing.  You don&#39;t have to be doing anything special. You could just
be going somewhere together, or putting them to bed, or pushing
them on the swings at the park. But you wouldn&#39;t trade these moments
for anything. One doesn&#39;t tend to associate kids with peace, but
that&#39;s what you feel.  You don&#39;t need to look any
further than where you are right now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before I had kids, I had moments of this kind of peace, but they
were rarer. With kids it can happen several times a day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My other source of data about kids was my own childhood, and that
was similarly misleading. I was pretty bad, and was always in trouble
for something or other. So it seemed to me that parenthood was
essentially law enforcement.  I didn&#39;t realize there were good times
too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remember my mother telling me once when I was about 30 that she&#39;d
really enjoyed having me and my sister. My god, I thought, this
woman is a saint. She not only endured all the pain we subjected
her to, but actually enjoyed it? Now I realize she was simply telling
the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She said that one reason she liked having us was that we&#39;d been
interesting to talk to. That took me by surprise when I had kids.
You don&#39;t just love them. They become your friends too. They&#39;re
really interesting. And while I admit small children are disastrously
fond of repetition (anything worth doing once is worth doing fifty
times) it&#39;s often genuinely fun to play with them.  That surprised
me too. Playing with a 2 year old was fun when I was 2 and definitely
not fun when I was 6. Why would it become fun again later? But it
does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are of course times that are pure drudgery. Or worse still,
terror. Having kids is one of those intense types of experience
that are hard to imagine unless you&#39;ve had them. But it is not, as I
implicitly believed before having kids, simply your DNA heading for
the lifeboats.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of my worries about having kids were right, though. They
definitely make you less productive. I know having kids makes some
people get their act together, but if your act was already together,
you&#39;re going to have less time to do it in. In particular, you&#39;re
going to have to work to a schedule. Kids have schedules.  I&#39;m not
sure if it&#39;s because that&#39;s how kids are, or because it&#39;s the only
way to integrate their lives with adults&#39;, but once you have kids,
you tend to have to work on their schedule.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will have chunks of time to work. But you can&#39;t let work spill
promiscuously through your whole life, like I used to before I had
kids. You&#39;re going to have to work at the same time every day,
whether inspiration is flowing or not, and there are going to be
times when you have to stop, even if it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve been able to adapt to working this way. Work, like love, finds
a way. If there are only certain times it can happen, it happens
at those times. So while I don&#39;t get as much done as before I had
kids, I get enough done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hate to say this, because being ambitious has always been a part
of my identity, but having kids may make one less ambitious. It
hurts to see that sentence written down. I squirm to avoid it. But
if there weren&#39;t something real there, why would I squirm?  The
fact is, once you have kids, you&#39;re probably going to care more
about them than you do about yourself. And attention is a zero-sum
game. Only one idea at a time can be the 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/top.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;top idea in your mind&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Once you have kids, it will often be your kids, and that means it
will less often be some project you&#39;re working on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have some hacks for sailing close to this wind. For example, when
I write essays, I think about what I&#39;d want my kids to know. That
drives me to get things right. And when I was writing 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/bel.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I told
my kids that once I finished it I&#39;d take them to Africa. When you
say that sort of thing to a little kid, they treat it as a promise.
Which meant I had to finish or I&#39;d be taking away their trip to
Africa.  Maybe if I&#39;m really lucky such tricks could put me net
ahead. But the wind is there, no question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, what kind of wimpy ambition do you have if it
won&#39;t survive having kids? Do you have so little to spare?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And while having kids may be warping my present judgement, it hasn&#39;t
overwritten my memory. I remember perfectly well what life was like
before. Well enough to miss some things a lot, like the
ability to take off for some other country at a moment&#39;s notice.
That was so great. Why did I never do that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See what I did there? The fact is, most of the freedom I had before
kids, I never used. I paid for it in loneliness, but I never used
it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had plenty of happy times before I had kids. But if I count up
happy moments, not just potential happiness but actual happy moments,
there are more after kids than before. Now I practically have it
on tap, almost any bedtime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People&#39;s experiences as parents
vary a lot, and I know I&#39;ve been lucky. But I think the worries I
had before having kids must be pretty common, and judging by other
parents&#39; faces when they see their kids, so must the happiness that
kids bring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I
now had to think about something I hadn&#39;t had to think about before:
how not to lose it.   I knew it was possible to go from rich to
poor, just as it was possible to go from poor to rich.  But while
I&#39;d spent a lot of the past several years studying the paths from
&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html&quot;&gt;poor to rich&lt;/a&gt;, 
I knew practically nothing about the paths from rich
to poor.  Now, in order to avoid them, I had to learn where they
were.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I started to pay attention to how fortunes are lost.  If you&#39;d
asked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I&#39;d have said by
spending all their money.  That&#39;s how it happens in books and movies,
because that&#39;s the colorful way to do it.  But in fact the way most
fortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through
bad investments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s hard to spend a fortune without noticing.  Someone with ordinary
tastes would find it hard to blow through more than a few tens of
thousands of dollars without thinking &quot;wow, I&#39;m spending a lot of
money.&quot;  Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose a
million dollars (as much as you want, really) in the blink of an
eye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In most people&#39;s minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarms
that making investments doesn&#39;t.  Luxuries seem self-indulgent.
And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery,
you&#39;ve already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads
to trouble.  Investing bypasses those alarms.  You&#39;re not spending
the money; you&#39;re just moving it from one asset to another.  Which
is why people trying to sell you expensive things say &quot;it&#39;s an
investment.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The solution is to develop new alarms.  This can be a tricky business,
because while the alarms that prevent you from overspending are so
basic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones that prevent you
from making bad investments have to be learned, and are sometimes
fairly counterintuitive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few days ago I realized something surprising: the situation with
time is much the same as with money.  The most dangerous way to
lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake
work.  When you spend time having fun, you know you&#39;re being
self-indulgent.  Alarms start to go off fairly quickly.  If I woke
up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I&#39;d
feel like something was terribly wrong.  Just thinking about it
makes me wince.  I&#39;d start to feel uncomfortable after sitting on
a sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yet I&#39;ve definitely had days when I might as well have sat in
front of a TV all day — days at the end of which, if I asked myself
what I got done that day, the answer would have been: basically,
nothing.  I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad
as I&#39;d feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV.  If
I spent a whole day watching TV I&#39;d feel like I was descending into
perdition.  But the same alarms don&#39;t go off on the days when I get
nothing done, because I&#39;m doing stuff that seems, superficially,
like real work.  Dealing with email, for example.  You do it sitting
at a desk.  It&#39;s not fun.  So it must be work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With time, as with money, avoiding pleasure is no longer enough to
protect you.  It probably was enough to protect hunter-gatherers,
and perhaps all pre-industrial societies.  So nature and nurture
combine to make us avoid self-indulgence. But the world has gotten
more complicated: the most dangerous traps now are new behaviors
that bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking more
virtuous types.  And the worst thing is, they&#39;re not even fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
