The lens in question is the AF 50mm F2 Air, which would join the existing AF 23mm F1.7, AF 20mm F2.8 Air, AF 35mm F1.7 Air, AF 40mm F2.5 Air and AF 56mm F1.7 Air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/cameras/lenses/viltrox-af-35mm-f1-7-review-effectively-a-neat-nifty-fifty-for-aps-c-format-mirrorless-cameras&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viltrox AF 35mm F1.7 Air full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As yet few details are known about the new lens. &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://photorumors.com/2025/03/24/new-viltrox-af-50mm-f-2-air-full-frame-lens-z-e-coming-in-april-2025/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Photo Rumors reports&lt;/a&gt; that it could have a minimum focus distance of 0.51m, take 58mm filters, weight 190g and be priced at $140. The latter is in-keeping with the accessible pricing of other lenses in the Air range which are all under $200.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several photos of the AF 50mm F2 Air have emerged. These indicate that the lens has  full-frame coverage, along with stepping motor autofocus and internal focussing. The optical path seems to include one or more aspherical and extra-low dispersion elements for reducing aberrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Viltrox AF 50mm F2 Air will reportedly be available in Sony E and Nikon Z mounts, and is rumored to go on sale in April.&lt;/p&gt;

But whether you’re an old hand with boxes of film transparencies in the attic or a younger generation experimenting with the charm and character of film for the first time – you’ll need some way to see your work and that’s where a slide viewer comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently got hold of two popular and very affordable models from Photolux (also called Zuma in the States) – the SV-2 and SV-3, though it’s the larger and slightly more expensive SV-3 model I’ll be assessing here. You can see reviews of the smaller SV-2 amongst other top products in our &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-slide-viewers&quot;&gt;best slide viewers&lt;/a&gt; buying guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-photolux-sv-3-led-slide-viewer-specifications&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Photolux SV-3 LED slide viewer: Specifications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-photolux-sv-3-led-slide-viewer-price&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Photolux SV-3 LED slide viewer: Price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costing $39/£24 at the time of writing, the Photolux / Zuma SV-3 LED slide viewer isn&#39;t much more expensive than the smaller SV-2 which costs ~$13, and it&#39;s definitely worth the extra money if your budget can stretch a little. The SV-3 is a fair bit larger and is more of a desktop model than the portable handheld SV-2, though its build quality and features make it totally worth the extra spend: larger viewfinder, higher magnification, a pass-through for rolls of film, and a much more even light source. The bigger question you should ask yourself is whether to go even more up-market and splash out on the $40 Kodak 35mm Slide Viewer which looks near-identical, though in my tests provides a better user experience with the upgraded build quality, a physical manual, and a USB power cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-photolux-sv-3-led-slide-viewer-design-handling&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Photolux SV-3 LED slide viewer: Design &amp;amp; Handling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Photolux SV-3 is the bigger brother to the Photolux SV-2 and takes up a much larger footprint though this comes with the benefit of having a solid base so that the viewfinder is always pointing towards you which could make long image culling sessions more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SV-3 is somewhere between two to three times larger than the SV-2, so if you’re looking for an option that doesn’t take up much space, or you want to travel with it, then the SV-2 could be the better contender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to the SV-2 this SV-3 model has a larger viewfinder with a more powerful magnification of 3x compared to the 2x of the SV-2. In reality, this meant a 35mm color slide measured across the long side was around 6cm on the glass viewfinder and around 4cm on the smaller SV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a battery door on the bottom of the unit which can take four AA batteries. There’s also a port for DC 6v 500mA power on the left side, though sadly no power adapter is included which does hamper its value a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the smaller Photolux SV-2 you need to press the slide surround firmly down into the device to power on the light, however it’s easier with the SV-3 as there’s a power switch. You also load the slide in via the back and push another button to eject it out the front, it takes about 10 slides before this is full and overflows, though it would have been nice to be able to stack up a batch of them at the rear to save you having to push every slide in individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:2000px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;dHbay5K6UfZUpswuy7fHDf&quot; name=&quot;SV-3_03&quot; alt=&quot;Zuma / Photolux SV-3 Slide Viewer&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dHbay5K6UfZUpswuy7fHDf.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2000&quot; height=&quot;1125&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;In addition to 5x5cm slides which can be loaded one at a time via the back of the SV-3, strips of film negatives can also be pushed through for easy viewing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SV-3 also has the ability to have a strip of negative film passed through it (above) and although this can be a little tricky to push through as it sometimes gets caught on exit, it was a feature I was glad to have and something the smaller, more affordable SV-2 isn’t able to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-photolux-sv-3-led-slide-viewer-performance&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Photolux SV-3 LED slide viewer: Performance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience with the Photolux SV-3 was very positive and it was certainly more convenient and takes up less space than a large light box and busting out a loupe. There’s a front tray to catch your ejected slides, though I do wish there was a loading mechanism to tee up several slides in the rear end so you don’t have to manually insert each one, though this is a minor nitpick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glass viewfinder provides 3x magnification so you can see your slides and negatives very clearly. The backlight is quite dull and flat which is actually a good thing as it means the slide is lit up consistently from corner to corner – the smaller Photolux SV-2 was notably brighter but with a bright hotspot in the centre that creates the illusion that your pictures have a heavy vignette. The SV-3 uses four small LED nodes spread out evenly so the slide is lit up well across the image, but the SV-2 uses a single powerful LED in the middle of the backlight.&lt;/p&gt;

It also catches surrounding light easily so is best used a dark room to cut down on glare &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the SV-3 the display is very sharp and crisp, though it is best used in a dark room as daylight can catch the large viewfinder and cause flare which makes it tricky to see the picture – it could do with a lens hood to block out external light. It would also have been useful to be able to change the angle of tilt as it’s locked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One issue with both the SV-2 and SV-3 models I looked at is that the large glass viewfinders are exposed and easy to catch dues. The large opening for your slides is also a bit of a dust trap and there’s not soft case provided with them. I resorted to draping a large microfibre cloth over the devices when not in use to stop dust building up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plastic slides hold their shape a lot better than cardboard ones and generally the SV-3 coped with both well and I had no problems. However, there were a couple of my cardboard slides that had warped significantly and these did tend to get caught in the Photolux SV-3, but didn’t cause any issues with the very similar Kodak 35mm Slide Viewer, so clearly the Kodak had more forgiving tolerances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:2000px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;R89yCUsgyKEKPjvbxryEDf&quot; name=&quot;SV-3_09&quot; alt=&quot;Zuma / Photolux SV-3 Slide Viewer&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R89yCUsgyKEKPjvbxryEDf.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2000&quot; height=&quot;1125&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Slides in cardboard mounts can tend to the lose their shape and warp a little, especially if water damaged. This slide was one of the worst offenders I had to hand and it would get caught up in the SV-3 regularly, though it passed through with no problems when using Kodak&#39;s more expensive 35mm Slide Viewer so clearly the two models are not as similar in build quality as their exterior looks would imply &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costing £20 / $26 the SV-3 doesn’t break the bank, though I didn’t expect much in terms of build quality. For twenty six bucks I’m obviously not expecting it to be up to the quality of a Leica or anything – some of the plastic joints have a bit of play in them,  though it’s more than good enough to serve its purpose and I was overall happy with the results. Although a mostly plastic construction some of the plastic looks quite thick and I can’t see any problems with it taking a tumble if accidentally knocked off a desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-photolux-sv-3-led-slide-viewer-verdict&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Photolux SV-3 LED slide viewer: Verdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve only got a super tight budget and you want to spend some time sorting through your old collection of slides and film then this isn’t the worst option for sorting out the keepers, but a question you&#39;ll need to ask yourself is what do you want to do after this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SV-3 has no ability to scan so you’ll need another gadget to digitize them, or stump up the cash to have them sent off to a lab to be scanned professionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SV-3 is a perfectly fine slide viewer and does exactly what it says on the tin. For this price, you can’t expect too much – it’s a very basic and bare-bones affair and the large exposed glass viewfinder is quite easy to get dusty and dirty so you’ll need to improvise some sort of cover to keep it clean between uses. But if you need a simple device to light up and see your old transparencies and negative rolls then the Photolux SV-3 is a decent shout. If you&#39;re after a more stress-free experience, the Kodak 35mm Slide Viewer looks very similar but has the better build quality and is less likely to jam with warped slides, it also comes with a USB power cable so you don&#39;t have to faff around with AA batteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If however, you want to digitize your old film you might be better off saving up and going for a product such as the Kodak Slide N Scan which admittedly is more expensive but hits two birds with one stone – as it&#39;s a slide/film viewer with the ability to scan and digitize them also.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s also the Kodak Mobile Film Scanner which allows you to use your phone to zoom in and see your film clearly, plus use the app to invert your negatives so you can clearly see them correctly (for both B&amp;amp;W and color). It&#39;s not the best device at scanning in the world, but it&#39;s decent for going through and culling your old film and transparencies.&lt;/p&gt;

The control panel is rather different but again relies exclusively on push buttons, as the larger LCD still isn’t a touchscreen. Even so, operation is simple and effective, and scanning speed is quick, although the actual image quality isn’t overly impressive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may have been launched back in 2018, but make no mistake: the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/sony-a7-iii-review&quot;&gt;Sony A7 III&lt;/a&gt; is still a highly capable camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its heart is a 24.2MP full-frame image sensor that delivers shots every bit as crisp and clean as you&#39;ll find on a newer camera, boasting a dynamic range of up to 15 stops with 14-bit RAW output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Sony&#39;s autofocus and video technology has advanced a lot in recent years, the A7 III&#39;s 693-point phase / 425-point contrast-detect AF system is still incredibly robust – and the uncropped 4K 24p remains perfectly serviceable for everyday shooting (though there is a slight crop at 30p).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a top speed of 10fps continuous shooting, you won&#39;t miss a moment of the action (though this isn&#39;t a sports camera, so don&#39;t expect the buffer depth of a pro body!) and the twin memory card slots give you peace of mind should something go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At under a grand, this is a fantastic way into full-frame Sony shooting – and a brilliant bargain in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;

Meet the new limited edition GoPro Hero 13 Black…that’s actually white</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The “Black” in GoPro’s nomenclature designates the action camera’ giants most advanced models, but for the latest launch, that “Black” is actually a bit of a misnomer. That’s because, for a limited time, the GoPro Hero 13 Black now comes in a new Polar White colorway. On Monday, March 24, GoPro announced the limited edition Polar White GoPro Hero13 Black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://gopro.com/en/cz/news/limited-edition-hero13-black-in-polar-white&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;new limited edition model&lt;/a&gt; carries all the same internal hardware features but puts the GoPro Hero13 Black in a white exterior, which makes the black lens, screens, and mounting points pop. Thankfully, the limited edition doesn’t come with a price jump, at least for the list price, though in some cases temporary sales mean the original black model is a bit cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Polar White edition reminds me of back when GoPro cameras used to be silver, although this isn’t the first time GoPro has launched a special edition that outfits an existing camera in a new color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:2820px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;YGVmvkUXqGokMLryjroFWh&quot; name=&quot;71er1wbJa8L._AC_SL1500_ copy&quot; alt=&quot;Polar White version of GoPro Hero13 Black camera&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YGVmvkUXqGokMLryjroFWh.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2820&quot; height=&quot;1587&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: GoPro)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color may play a role in more than just the look and feel of the camera though. I’m reminded of why camera color matters every time I fly my gray drone against an overcast gray sky. A dropped white GoPro may be easier to locate in a field of green grass than a black one, although the opposite is true when taking that white GoPro to the ski slopes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you already own the GoPro Hero 13 Black and are jealous of that new colorway though, GoPro also makes a silicon sleeve with a lanyard that would effectively reskin your current camera in a new color, and there’s a white as well as a blue and black option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The limited edition Polar White version of the GoPro Hero 13 Black comes in at the same list price of $399 / £399 / AU$649. It&#39;s available now from &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/buy/hero13black/CHDHX-131-master.html?option-id=CHDHX-132-master&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;sponsored&quot;&gt;the official GoPro store&lt;/a&gt; and is rolling out to retailers including &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-Limited-HERO13-Black-Polar/dp/B0DYPJ8GK7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;sponsored&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1882384-REG/gopro_chdhx_132_th_hero13_polar_white.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;sponsored&quot;&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AGO Film Processor is compatible with Paterson Super System 4 developing tanks, supporting formats from 35mm up to large format films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its automated agitation system ensures consistent development by rotating the film reels within the tank, effectively reducing the manual labor typically associated with film processing. A standout feature is its clever temperature compensation system, which adjusts development times based on real-time chemical temperature readings, mitigating the need for constant temperature monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the processor offers Wi-Fi connectivity, allowing users to create or modify development programs and update the software as new processes become available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constructed with durability in mind, the AGO Film Processor provides users with confidence in their investment. Its sturdy build ensures longevity, making it a reliable addition to any darkroom setup. The user interface is intuitive, featuring pre-programmed settings for popular film stocks, which simplifies the development process. For those who prefer customization, the processor allows easy adjustments to development times, agitation speeds, and intervals, catering to both novices and seasoned professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, the AGO Film Processor excels in delivering consistent and high-quality results. The automated agitation and temperature compensation features work harmoniously to ensure that variables affecting film development are kept in check. Users have reported that the processor makes film developing straightforward, allowing them to engage in other activities during the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The processor&#39;s ability to handle various film stocks with ease, including Ilford HP5 and FP4, offers flexibility to photographers experimenting with different emulsions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the notable advantages of the AGO Film Processor is its efficient use of chemicals. By employing horizontal rotational agitation, the processor can save up to 60% on chemical consumption, depending on the tank size and use case. This not only reduces the environmental footprint but also translates to cost savings over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the initial investment in the Ago film processor may seem substantial to some, it&#39;s essential to consider the long-term benefits. By bringing film development in-house, photographers can significantly reduce the costs associated with outsourcing to external labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machine has the potential to pay for itself after developing approximately 20 rolls of film, making it a cost-effective solution for regular film shooters.&lt;/p&gt;

But as a photographer still carrying around two slightly dated X-T4 bodies in my kit, there’s one feature that I really hope to see in the Fujifilm X-T6: a leap forward in autofocus performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fujifilm hasn’t given any indication yet when or even if a Fujifilm X-T6 is coming. And to be 100% clear, camera launches don’t come with the same amount of predictability as, say, the iPhone updates. But with the X-T4 launched in April 2020 and the X-T5 in November 2022, we’re getting close to the 2.5-year age gap between the last two models.  Similarly, the X-T3 launched in September 2018, and the X-T2 in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/fujifilm-x-t5-review&quot;&gt;Fujifilm X-T5&lt;/a&gt; made a big jump forward in resolution, stepping up to a 40.2MP sensor. This is why, if the Fujifilm X-T6 is coming, I don’t think it needs another resolution bump. What I most want to see, instead, is improvements in the camera’s autofocus system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fujifilm is more known for its colors and retro charm than speed, but when I first tried the X-T5, I thought there were a few instances where the autofocus system struggled with those extra pixels and didn’t perform quite as well as my &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/fujifilm-x-t4-review&quot;&gt;X-T4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Fujifilm has steadily launched &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/news/fujifilm-to-improve-video-performance-in-three-cameras-via-an-upcoming-firmware-update&quot;&gt;several autofocus updates via firmware since then&lt;/a&gt; – and &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/fujifilm/comments/13srtvt/af_improvement_results_with_new_firmware_on_xt5/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;users have reported&lt;/a&gt; significantly better autofocus. This has me exceptionally hopeful for the Fujifilm X-T6. I don’t need sports-level performance as a wedding and portrait photographer, but I need a camera that can still lock focus on a dark dance floor and I need a camera that can use eye-AF on a squirmy toddler. Fujifilm’s steady pace of firmware updates has me hopeful that the X-T6 will be just what I’ve been looking for. If the X-T6 has the autofocus of the higher-end X-H2 series but the size and retro dials of the X-T5, then I’m expecting great things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I could play devil&#39;s advocate here and say that, if that firmware is good enough, then Fujifilm might not need to update the X-T5 just yet. The Fujifilm X-T5 is already one of &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-fujifilm-camera&quot;&gt;our favorite Fujifilm cameras&lt;/a&gt;, and I would expect that the current 40.2MP sensor and the X-Processor 5 would be replaced first in the pricier X-H series. I would love to see the stacked sensor of the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/fujifilm-x-h2s-review&quot;&gt;Fujifilm X-H2s&lt;/a&gt; come to Fujifilm’s higher resolution 40.2MP sensor, but I would expect such a change to come to the X-H series first before the X-T series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the autofocus isn’t the only reason that I didn’t update. The other reason is cost. I’m more likely to update on every other model rather than buy a new camera every time one is released. But with the X-T4 in my bag, I’m going to be much more tempted once the camera that I have is two generations old. The other obstacle factoring into the cost is that &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/news/i-bought-an-x-t5-and-now-my-lenses-arent-good-enough-its-actually-that-serious&quot;&gt;older lenses don’t perform as well with the higher-resolution sensor&lt;/a&gt;, so I suspect I would want to update at least one of my lenses along with the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the firmware updates and sensor and processor inside the X-T5 still being current hardware, I wouldn’t be surprised if a Fujifilm X-T6 doesn’t come in 2025. It’s probably better for my budget if an X-T6 doesn’t come this year. But, if Fujifilm does update the series, improved autofocus is at the very top of my wish list.&lt;/p&gt;

A label like Atlantic wasn’t just home to the greatest musicians of the last century, it was also a magnet for the world’s best photographers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the unmistakable presence of Ray Charles to the swagger of Led Zeppelin, these aren’t just snapshots; they’re cultural and historical documents. This book is a hall of fame, not just for iconic musicians, but for legendary photographers who helped shape their image and cement how we remember them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1947, when Ahmet Ertegun and two fellow music fans started Atlantic Records in New York City, they never could have known that their passion for discovering artists and making records would shape 75 years of popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason for such tremendous global success was a groundbreaking industry model that embraced and championed a wide range of genres such as R&amp;amp;B, soul, jazz and hip-hop, as well as rock, pop, dance and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s fair to say that &lt;em&gt;75 Years of Atlantic Records&lt;/em&gt; is the official and definitive photographic history of this legendary record label. Four years in the making, it features images from Atlantic’s extensive archives, many of them published here for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book presents these moments in all their glory, from polished portraits to behind-the-scenes glimpses of creative chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photography has always been a crucial part of music culture, shaping the way we perceive artists and their legacies. This book doesn’t just assemble an impressive list of names, it highlights how visual storytelling helped define entire eras of sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the raw energy of Anton Corbijn’s pre-show portraits to Annie Leibovitz’s timeless studio compositions, these images show moments of transformation, rebellion and reinvention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s fascinating to see how each photographer interpreted their subject. The quiet intensity of John Coltrane through Lee Friedlander’s lens is a world apart from the theatrical presence of the Rolling Stones as shot by David LaChapelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each photograph reflects a deliberate choice, whether to amplify the myth or strip it away, to celebrate the spectacle or reveal the individual beneath.&lt;/p&gt;

According to market research company BCN+R, the company with the largest share of the compact camera market in Japan right now is Kodak, followed by Fujifilm, Canon, Kenko Tokina, Panasonic, Ricoh, Sony, and OM System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BCN+R tracks data from a majority of electronics retailers in Japan; but notably, the company doesn’t track specialist stores like Map Camera, so the company’s data is more of a look at the overall consumer market than stores that cater specifically to photographers. While the data only looks at a portion of the market, the numbers highlight some interesting trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bcnretail.com/market/detail/20250323_502937.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;According to BCN+R&lt;/a&gt;, the resurgence of &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-point-and-shoot-cameras&quot;&gt;point-and-shoot cameras&lt;/a&gt; as major brands focused instead on mirrorless cameras meant low-priced compact cameras were nearly disappearing, leaving only high-end models available. Cheap cameras like the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/kodak-pixpro-fz55-review&quot;&gt;Kodak PIXPRO FZ55&lt;/a&gt; pushed the brand to the top seller for compacts in Japan. Kodak had more than 36% of the market share early in 2024, but BCN+R notes that a price increase on that camera allowed Canon to temporarily overtake Kodak. But, in the first two months of 2025, Kodak slipped back on the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note, however, that Kodak licenses its brand name to other companies and the FZ55 is actually manufactured by JK Imaging Ltd. along with several other Kodak-branded cameras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BCN+R credits Fujifilm’s rise to second place last month to the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/fujifilm-instax-mini-evo&quot;&gt;Instax Mini Evo&lt;/a&gt;, an inexpensive film-digital hybrid rather than the hard-to-find X100VI. The data company notes that Canon’s IXY 650, which is called the PowerShot ELPH 360 HS in the US and the IXUS 285 HS in Europe, significantly contributed to Canon’s sales. The &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/cameras/mirrorless-cameras/panasonic-lumix-tz99-zs99-review&quot;&gt;Panasonic Lumix TZ99&lt;/a&gt; helped push Panasonic from eighth to fifth place. (The compact camera from Kenko Tokina that made the list isn’t available worldwide.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data hints that budget-priced compact cameras are in high demand, at least among general consumers in Japan. Specialist camera stores like Map Camera, which cater more to photographers than general consumers, had &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/cameras/compact-cameras/half-of-the-bestsellers-on-this-list-are-compact-cameras-including-this-unexpected-cheap-point-and-shoot&quot;&gt;more high-end compacts on its list of best-selling cameras for February&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/fujifilm-x100vi-review-dont-mess-with-a-winner&quot;&gt;Fujifilm X100VI&lt;/a&gt; in first place, with the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/features/ricoh-gr-iii-vs-gr-iiix&quot;&gt;Ricoh GRIIx&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/ricoh-gr-iii-hdf-review&quot;&gt;GR III&lt;/a&gt; also in the top five. Budget-priced cameras aren’t absent from Map Camera’s numbers, however, with the TZ99 at number seven last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BCN+R also notes that the sales of interchangeable cameras have been declining in its data, although the category still accounts for more than 60% of the market when looking at value rather than the number of cameras shipped. One factor, the company suggests, is the rise in prices from inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the data from BCN+R only offers a look at data from a specific segment of the camera market, the numbers show an interesting skew towards budget cameras, suggesting the return of compact cameras isn’t exclusive to high-end models that offer better image quality than a smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;

And the reason why? Missing memory cards. That&#39;s right, you can have the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-front-and-rear-dash-cams&quot;&gt;best front and rear dash cams&lt;/a&gt; in the world, but without an SD card, they&#39;re pretty useless...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the Williams team believed the cameras would come with formatted memory cards already installed by the FIA, with F1 stewards quoting F1 Technical Regulation TD034L: “‘Teams are responsible for ensuring that cameras are fitted with a suitably formatted (...) and empty SD card at least 10 minutes prior to the start of any session”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stewards have revealed that a flashing LED on the cameras in question alerted Williams to a potential problem during Free Practice 1 [FP1] and that this was reported, but that the team failed to report the missing memory cards after FP1 had ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;F1 teams are currently required to supply video footage so the sport’s governing body can monitor the flex of a slot gap in the rear wing, with more flex potentially boosting a car’s aerodynamics. However, it’s been made clear that there is no indication that wing flex in either Williams car is suspected to be illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams has since released a statement on X (formerly Twitter), explaining that all required footage was delivered last weekend at the Australian Grand Prix and that the team was running the same wing setup in Shanghai as it was in Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;

The Meet series is intended as a more accessibly priced option which can serve as a high-end webcam, and allow access to some of the company&#39;s impressive AI software, but – with no moving parts – cannot actually turn the camera to follow you (or your subject) around a room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The camera makes up for this – especially this new Meet 2 with its 4K resolution – to some extent by cropping and panning to give the illusion of tracking a subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The camera is thus a great webcam which you can plug into the computer via USB-C (and, pleasingly, there is a USB-A adapter in the box). It is much more than that though, with a lot of its features released if you download and install the Obsbot Center app – which allows you to access all kinds of features to adjust the picture and even the appearance of the subject. Some of these I tried on my girlfriend later in the review...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-pricing&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pricing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At release, the Obsbot Meet 2 is priced at $129 for a box including a USB-C to USB-C cable, a USB-A adapter (the camera is powered by this cable), and a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an increase over the original 1080P meet, but the value of the 4K camera is significantly higher, and the software has moved on a step since then too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-specs&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Specs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-build-and-handling&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Build and handling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Available in a choice of three colours, the Meet 2 is great for matching space grey or white laptops/computers, or adding a bit of a jaunty feel with the green option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device itself is a small rectangle of quality plastic with a protruding lens and rounded corners which looks broadly at home on a stylish modern device like the MacBook Pro I tested it with. The base has a fixed screw thread for a tripod mount, but the box also includes a hinged monitor clip with a rubber grip and a built-in magnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is brilliantly useful for dropping the camera top your laptop on the go, plugging it in and then roughly pointing it by simply grabbing the device and pointing it where you want it – it doesn&#39;t have to be directly in line with the clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:3531px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;fGPEwcysdHmMgQHeTkSmJb&quot; name=&quot;Obsbot-Meet2-Sideways&quot; alt=&quot;Obsbot Meet 2 in portrait mode on MacBook&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fGPEwcysdHmMgQHeTkSmJb.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;3531&quot; height=&quot;1986&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The meet 2 being used in portrait format thanks to the magnetic mounting system. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magnetic mount system and square design also makes it a cinch to re-position the camera for portrait use, which is more than can be said for many integrated-clip designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some don&#39;t understand it, but the magnetic mount to the stand is the strongest and smartest part of the design (the magnetic lens cover is less ideal if you throw the camera in your bag a lot, but equally elegant as a peace-of-mind privacy guard)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:5299px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;33NnWn3p6EfZZjVu6wYhbW&quot; name=&quot;Obsbot-Meet2-OnDell&quot; alt=&quot;Obsbot Meet 2 on Dell Monitor&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/33NnWn3p6EfZZjVu6wYhbW.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;5299&quot; height=&quot;2981&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The Obsbot Meet 2 sat on a generic Dell monitor (no cable connected). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clip mount is small and light and easy to hang off any laptop or your average indoor monitor, but it does lack a screw mount – you only have the one in the camera – so you cannot tilt the camera on one of those simple portable tripod poles using the supplied support. This is unlikely to be an issue for many, but is worth noting. Thick monitors may be a challenge, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-performance&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Performance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of video quality, this camera comes out of the box impressive and gets even better when you tweak the settings. HDR can be adjusted using Obsbot Center app. The name is no coincidence, by the way – the camera goes very well with the Open Broadcast streaming platform OBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lower light, the camera will show some grain, but is still far better than built-in cameras, and the AF didn&#39;t seem to struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simple gesture-based tracking – activated by making a simple L-sign with your hand – is surprisingly effective too, even on this compact camera. We tested it in a number of places including a kitchen with a loaded counter, and still it was able to follow a subject all the way behind it to the far end of the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course the camera can&#39;t turn, so it is more limited than a PTZ alternative, but for gaming streamers for example, that won&#39;t prove an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obsbot Center app also offers extensive live face filters and what it calls &#39;Retouching&#39; under the &#39;Beauty&#39; heading, so we tried these. There was only one &#39;MAN&#39; (yes, it&#39;s in caps in the app for some reason) sub-section but two – Native &amp;amp; Classic, targeting the feminine – so I persuaded my girlfriend to sit at a very unflattering angle for an experiment...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her verdict, after playing with sliders that allowed her to adjust the width of all her facial features, not to mention change her eye size and color and even give herself &#39;Elf eyes&#39; was very positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helped a great deal that my M3 MacBook Pro had no issues keeping up with the video and providing the artificial alterations, though the app did offer a warning of possible stuttering, so the &#39;Beauty&#39; mode is by no means guaranteed on less high-spec machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-overall-verdict&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Overall Verdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent little camera offering a surprising level of quality given it doesn&#39;t have the moving parts that some of Obsbot&#39;s other offerings have. This clearly gives it a price advantage and, also, a bit more of a portable and rugged feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously this comes at the expense of quality and the extent of panning range, but this is still a brilliant 4K webcam which – given the quality of Obsbot&#39;s software – could well also serve as sufficient auto-tracking for many. It is easy to delve into powerful features too, which adds even more fun (and helps keeps up with the demands creators face).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anything the thing that lets this camera down (if anything) is that the video quality is so good that gamers, video streamers and other creators will be disappointed by the fairly average microphones in comparison to the excellent video (which also looks brilliant in normal 1080P calls). To get the best out of it, be prepared to bring a mic to the party too, but the look of the camera and the stream are hard to beat for the price!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tested a lot of webcams over the years, including many Obsbot products. I have experience running live streaming events from my professional life, using software like OBS, and I have also used Obsbot and other brand&#39;s broadcast quality PTZ cameras, so I have a good idea of the features I need to test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this particular case, I also persuaded my girlfriend to subject herself to the AI because there seemed to be more &#39;Beauty&#39; options targeting consumers who identify (or want to) as women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the standout features of the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/panasonic-lumix-gh7-review&quot;&gt;Panasonic GH7&lt;/a&gt; is its cutting-edge video technology. It boasts 4K and even 6K recording options, giving creators the flexibility to shoot in stunning detail with rich colors and dynamic range. The inclusion of advanced codecs, high bit rates, and professional-grade color profiles ensures that footage is not only sharp but also highly gradable in post-production. Whether you’re producing cinematic content, YouTube videos, or professional documentaries, the GH7 provides the tools to elevate your work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beyond its impressive video specs, the GH7 excels in usability and ergonomics. The camera body is compact yet sturdy, making it perfect for shooting on the go. It features an articulating touchscreen, allowing for easy framing in a variety of shooting scenarios, whether you&#39;re recording yourself for vlogs or capturing low-angle shots. Additionally, its improved autofocus system, enhanced stabilization, and extended battery life make long shooting sessions smoother and more efficient.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photographers will also find plenty to love in the GH7. While primarily known for its video capabilities, it delivers outstanding stills performance thanks to its high-resolution sensor and improved image processing engine. The camera’s burst shooting mode and deep buffer ensure that fast-moving action is captured with precision, making it a versatile option for hybrid shooters who need both high-quality video and still images in one package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its current record-low price, the Panasonic Lumix GH7 is an unbeatable deal for any serious content creator. Its combination of professional-grade video, strong photography performance, and excellent usability make it a compelling choice in the mirrorless market. If you&#39;ve been considering an upgrade or stepping into the world of high-end video production, now is the perfect time to grab the GH7 at this incredible price before it goes back up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See our pick of the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-lenses-for-the-panasonic-lumix-gh7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;best lenses for the Panasonic GH7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;

And in a world where our smartphones are demanding more and more of our attention, a new category of phone has emerged. These so-called &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-dumbphone&quot;&gt;dumbphones&lt;/a&gt; don&#39;t boast about how many features they offer, but how few. In other words, they promise a deliberately minimalist experience for those seeking digital balance and a clearer, uncluttered mind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all dumbphones are the same. At one end of the spectrum there are those, such as the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tech/phones/nokia-6310-review-relive-the-early-2000s-with-this-nostalgic-feature-phone&quot;&gt;Nokia 6310&lt;/a&gt;, that deliberately ape the feature phones of the early 2000s. But while these are cheap to buy, they also &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; cheap and, well, a bit nasty. Using one in public, you can feel passers-by looking at you with sympathy, assuming you can&#39;t afford a smartphone... or maybe that you&#39;ve just got out of prison and are still using the one you went in with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the spectrum, if you want to digitally detox in style there are some seriously premium models. The Punkt MP02&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;sports an elegantly minimalist design that will make it the talk of any middle-class dinner party. It&#39;s not cheap, and that&#39;s no accident. The Swiss company behind it is specifically targeting design-conscious professionals and digital minimalists willing to pay for superior aesthetics and build quality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is it actually any good? I spent a few weeks with it to find out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-punkt-mp02-specifications&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Punkt MP02: Specifications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:1436px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;Nsursr8uHSkNxvRXpyabZJ&quot; name=&quot;punkt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Punkt MP02 phone on desk&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nsursr8uHSkNxvRXpyabZJ.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;1436&quot; height=&quot;808&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-punkt-mp02-pricing-and-availability&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Punkt MP02: Pricing and availability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Punkt MP02 costs around $379/£259, positioning it firmly in the high-end category of feature phones. This is significantly higher than most competitors, including the Light Phone II ($299) or Nokia&#39;s feature phones (under $100). The MP02 doesn&#39;t actually have more features than these phones; its higher pricing is more a reflective of its premium design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MP02 is available directly from Punkt&#39;s website and select retailers including Amazon, though in practice availability can be limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-punkt-mp02-build-and-handling&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Punkt MP02: Build and handling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:4000px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;vj8N8hiJSkQuz7D4MmrNN4&quot; name=&quot;20250320_130807.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Punkt MP02 phone on desk&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vj8N8hiJSkQuz7D4MmrNN4.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;4000&quot; height=&quot;2250&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MP02&#39;s physical appearance—crafted by industrial designer Jasper Morrison—is undoubtedly its standout feature. Not only is it nice to look at, but it&#39;s nice to hold and use, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get specific, the trapezoidal form with a gently angled back sits perfectly in your hand, with a weight and balance that feels purposeful and substantial. The glass-fiber reinforced housing, with its textured finish, provides excellent grip and resists fingerprints. The rounded, calculator-like number keys are nicely spaced and offer a satisfying, tactile click when typing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2in monochrome display is small, but it&#39;s bright enough to do the job well, especially considering how basic the interface is. Button placement has been carefully considered too, with the power button positioned at the top and navigation controls easily accessible with your thumb.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charging the MP02 is easy, because this phone comes with a USB-C port. That&#39;s a nice change from cheaper feature phones, most of which have the older micro-USB slots that require a different cable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the downside, the lack of dedicated volume buttons means you have to do quite a bit of faffing in the menu to adjust volume during calls. There&#39;s also no headphone jack, although my phone did come with a USB-C adapter in the box, plus you could always use Bluetooth headphones.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest hardware omission, finally, is the lack of a camera. That means not only will you not be able to take photos or video, but you can&#39;t use QR codes either. Whether you see that as a negative or positive I guess comes down to how seriously you want to take your digital detox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:1200px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;QjkZxnAKYE39FPpWNgk3Dg&quot; name=&quot;img_0226169.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Punkt MP02 dumb phone&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QjkZxnAKYE39FPpWNgk3Dg.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-punkt-mp02-performance&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Punkt MP02: Performance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when we mainly used phones to, you know, call people? Well that&#39;s the main purpose of the MP02, and I found it performed admirably. Call quality was excellent, with the earpiece providing clear, loud audio that worked well even in noisy streets with two buses passing each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speakerphone isn&#39;t the loudest I&#39;ve ever heard, but it offered clear audio without distortion. Battery life impressed too. The MP02 claims to deliver more than seven hours of talk time and while I didn&#39;t specifically test that claim myself (I don&#39;t have that much conversation in me), I found could easily last four to five days of normal use without charging, while leaving it on standby extended this beyond a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The text-only interface, though, does takes some getting used to. Firstly, it&#39;s so basic that it feels more like using a calculator than a phone, which can be quite disorientating. (On that note, there is actually a calculator tool here, as well as a note tool and calendar.) Secondly, you&#39;ll spend a lot of time looking up and memorizing a series of button combinations and workflows. None of these are intuitive, and I had to refer back to the instructions, and the occassional YouTube video, quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, once I&#39;d mastered all the combos and shortcuts, I found I could get quick access to essential functions. The predictive T9 texting worked well in practice for me, too, although it may well feel archaic to younger users who&#39;ve never experienced non-touchscreen phones. (If it&#39;s a real issue, however, you could always connect a Bluetooth keyboard.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:4000px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;6n5wQHa5xLapWvRQq8cDX4&quot; name=&quot;20250320_131534.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Punkt MP02 phone on desk&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6n5wQHa5xLapWvRQq8cDX4.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;4000&quot; height=&quot;2250&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond voice and normal texts, the MP02&#39;s standout feature is Pigeon: its implementation of Signal Private Messenger. This brings secure, encrypted communications to a feature phone, which I&#39;m pretty sure is a unique offering in this market right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, you can only use this to message other Punkt MP02 owners, and as I don&#39;t know any, I couldn&#39;t actually test this myself. Customer reviews and discussions on places like Reddit, though, suggest it works as advertised; I certainly didn&#39;t unearth any complaints or reports of bugs. (For friends who don&#39;t have a Punkt MP02, by the way, you can just send normal texts.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many feature phones, this phone can connect to WiFi and 4G; you can also share the latter as a hotpsot. But otherwise, there&#39;s actually little you can do with the internet. Beyond Pigeon, the MP02 has purposely been designed not to work with apps; nor does it offer tracking or location services. Basically, the whole point is to not let you do stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of that is to help clear your mind and keep your data safe. If you like the sound of either of those things, this phone will deliver. If it scares you rigid, though, you may be better off with a less restricted feature phone. For example, unlike the MP02, the Light Phone II has a music and podcast player, a larger, e-ink screen and a virtual on-screen keyboard,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-punkt-mp02-verdict&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Punkt MP02: Verdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:4000px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;LNZxkhjFU7AsdA7mpbtup4&quot; name=&quot;20250320_130744.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Punkt MP02 phone on desk&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LNZxkhjFU7AsdA7mpbtup4.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;4000&quot; height=&quot;2250&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Punkt MP02 delivers on its core promise: helping you disconnect while allowing voice calls and texts, in a way that keeps your data secure. It&#39;s not perfect: it feels overpriced, the interface could be more intuitive, and the lack of a headphone jack, torch, camera and physical volume buttons can be frustrating. However, it does looks and feel very much like a premium product. And so if you&#39;re seeking digital balance and a secure way of communicating, all in one beautifully minimalist design, it&#39;s a compelling option.&lt;/p&gt;

It has a seriously good-looking AMOLED display and mighty speakers for a midrange phone. There are three cameras around the back, a primary, ultra-wide, and macro trio, and the phone can capture 4K video from the front and rear cameras, a win for vloggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samsung&#39;s also future-proofing the A56 brilliantly with its promise of seven years of continued software support, and we&#39;re delighted that it ships with 256GB storage as standard, double the base model &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tech/android-phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Galaxy S25&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-samsung-galaxy-a56-5g-review-design-and-screen&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Samsung Galaxy A56 5G review: design and screen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On paper, the Samsung Galaxy A56 5G should feel premium. It has a glass back and a metal frame with some fine-looking contouring, and it&#39;s durable, too, with IP67 dust and water resistance. Tapping the back, however, feels hollow; the shiny glass clings onto fingerprints if you get a darker-colored finish, and the flat sides don&#39;t flow into the front and back, with no 2.5D glass on the display, making it feel slightly underbaked alongside some more affordable competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available in Lightgrey, Graphite, Olive, and Pink, we tested the Lightgrey model, and it&#39;s super-safe but struggles to stand out. It&#39;s also the worst culprit for being a fingerprint magnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the Galaxy A55 5G before, the A56 5G has a flat back and front, though the upgraded brushed metal frame is a nice touch this time. The ramp along the rail, contouring to the power and volume buttons, helps elevate things (literally and figuratively); there&#39;s a triple camera around the back, a USB-C port at the base, a dual-SIM slot, and a loudspeaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phone measures a slender 7.4mm thin and weighs 198g, but it doesn&#39;t feel as skinny as the numbers suggest with its expansive surface area and slightly chunky bezels (though it&#39;s got nothing on the big-bezelled Pixel 9a).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A56 5G is also IP67-rated for dust and water resistance and protected by Gorilla Glass Victus+ on the front and back which is competitive at its price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A56 5G&#39;s 6.7-inch AMOLED display is large and looks great, with a resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels and a pixel density of 385 pixels per inch. It&#39;s relatively sharp, has a great contrast ratio for depth and punchy highlights, and it also glides at up to 120Hz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a peak brightness of up to 1900 nits when displaying HDR content, 1200 nits in high brightness mode (in direct sunlight), and HDR and HD Netflix certification, it&#39;s easy to see what&#39;s on-screen and watching content on the A56 5G is a fantastic experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going beyond the screen, the A56 5G is also a great streaming option thanks to its speakers, which are excellent in its class, outperforming alternatives like the Poco X7 Pro. Matched with the expansive, quality display, watching content on it is a treat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A56 5G has three cameras around the back – a wide, ultra-wide, and a macro camera – with the wide being the best specced, and the ultra-wide, macro, and selfie cameras falling behind with smaller sensors and no autofocus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:3743px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;uY8FNK5GuQhnZnmrCBjELQ&quot; name=&quot;Samsung Galaxy A56 5G&quot; alt=&quot;A photo of the Samsung Galaxy A56 5G&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uY8FNK5GuQhnZnmrCBjELQ.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;3743&quot; height=&quot;2108&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Basil Kronfli)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23mm main camera: &lt;/strong&gt;50MP, 1/1.56-inch sensor with an f/1.8 aperture lens and OIS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13mm ultra-wide camera:&lt;/strong&gt; 12MP, 1/3.06-inch sensor with an f/2.2 lens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25mm macro camera: &lt;/strong&gt;5MP sensor with an f/2.4 lens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25mm front camera: &lt;/strong&gt;12MP sensor with an f/2.2 lens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main, ultra-wide, and selfie cameras support video recording up to 4K at 30 frames per second, which is competitive without being class-leading, with some alternatives able to shoot 4K 60fps footage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there’s a Pro mode for manual shooting, none of the Galaxy A56 5G’s cameras capture RAW photos natively, and you can&#39;t access Expert RAW, which is available for the Galaxy S and Z series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-samsung-galaxy-a56-5g-camera-verdict&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Samsung Galaxy A56 5G: camera verdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some highlights of the Galaxy A56 5G&#39;s camera – the primary camera is relatively reliable, and the ultra-wide is especially wide at 13mm. In bright environments, both cameras do a solid job of capturing detailed shots with rich colors, and you can comfortably punch into a 2x zoom and still get usable results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indoors and in darker scenes, all three cameras struggle, but the main camera is unsurprisingly the strongest. The fast lens and relatively large lens make sure there&#39;s depth separation for close-up objects, and a steady hand typically yields a clean picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In darker environments, shadow detail isn&#39;t as strong as it could be, and across the board, Samsung applies a lot of sharpening that makes focal points look unnatural when viewing images on a big screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colors are handled a bit clumsily by the A56 5G, especially when cropping in with the digital zoom, even in bright scenes. It&#39;s also worth noting that this isn&#39;t a phone you want if you have a shaky hand, with action shots and quick snaps when walking, generally coming out blurrier than some similarly priced alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The macro camera adds very limited value compared to the main camera. With its 5MP resolution and small sensor, its photos can look fine, but typically, we got more detail from the 50MP main camera when we cropped in on shots. Being fixed-focus, it&#39;s finicky, and it struggles in low light, too, so it&#39;s starting to feel like an unnecessary camera for the sake of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we seldom took a photo on the A56 5G and thought to ourselves – this is a keeper – and that has a lot to do with Samsung&#39;s photo processing on its midrange phones. By contrast, alternatives like the Nothing Phone (3a) Pro and Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus left us with more usable shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video shot on the Galaxy A56 5G&#39;s main camera looks good in bright environments, and hand shake is kept at bay with OIS and EIS kicking in. Avoid switching to the ultra-wide in anything but ideal lighting; not only will the resolution drop, but noise is handled badly, so you&#39;re better off sticking to the primary camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where the A56 5G shines is selfies and video, with 4K capture from the main camera held steady and the picture looking competitive across lighting conditions. The phone&#39;s selfies are also nice and sharp while still being moderately flattering, and selfie video also looks strong, so vloggers on a budget could do a lot worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We experienced confusing performance results from the Galaxy A56 5G. On the one hand, the Exynos 1580 chipset handled a game that typically stalls low-end phones &lt;em&gt;relatively&lt;/em&gt; well (Wuthering Waves), while another typically well-optimized game (Genshin Impact), ground the phone to a stuttery halt. When you&#39;re paying as much as Samsung is charging for the A56 5G, it&#39;s fair to expect a reliably smooth gaming experience, albeit not a maxed-out one. Unfortunately, you don&#39;t get that here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day-to-day use, in contrast to gaming, was smooth. We didn&#39;t experience any UI grumbles, Samsung&#39;s latest version of OneUI is feature-rich, though misses out on the Now Briefing feature introduced on the flagship Galaxy S25 series. This is no big loss based on our early testing, and anyone coming from a Samsung phone should feel right at home with the A56 5G.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 256GB storage (though there will also be a 128GB enterprise version for businesses), the Galaxy A56 5G is the first Samsung A-series phone we&#39;ve tested to compete with brands like Honor, Xiaomi, Poco, and Redmi when it comes to storage space, which is a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Galaxy A56 5G&#39;s 5000mAh battery lasts a full day with standard to heavy use and can creep into the second day with light use relatively comfortably. Missing out on fast or wireless charging holds the phone back from besting alternatives like the Poco X7 Pro or Pixel 9a, with a full charge taking a little less than 80 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-samsung-galaxy-a56-5g-verdict&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Samsung Galaxy A56 5G verdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A56 5G is a great phone for watching on. Its large, bright, smooth screen and punchy speakers shine, and the phone&#39;s upgraded storage is a great move from Samsung, so anyone coming from a past A-series device plagued by low-memory warnings, those should be a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phone&#39;s highlights can&#39;t quite compensate for its shortcomings, at least not at its asking price on launch. The A56 5G&#39;s camera is weak for stills, the camera mix is overbaked – fewer cameras with cleaner processing would help things along – and the performance inconsistencies when gaming feel at odds with the phone&#39;s positioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while anyone who picks the A56 5G up on a great value network or carrier plan will get a fantastic watching and listening experience, not to mention all-day battery life and decent video recording, at full price, it can&#39;t quite stand out amongst tough competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submissions for the 2025 Prize reflected a diverse and compelling interpretation of the theme ‘Unity.’ Artists from Latin America, Europe, the MENA region, and South Asia explored how individuals, communities and nature come together to heal, reconcile and foster connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through innovative approaches and visually striking compositions, the winning photographers have pushed the boundaries of contemporary photographic practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winners were selected by an esteemed external jury, co-chaired by Fiona Rogers, the Parasol Foundation curator of women in photography at the V&amp;amp;A, and Vivienne Gamble, co-founder of Peckham 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel also included Dr Charmaine Toh, senior curator of international art (photography) at Tate; Thyago Nogueira, head of contemporary photography at Instituto Moreira Salles in Brazil; and acclaimed British artist Gillian Wearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are delighted to announce such a diverse and talented group of global artists as the winners of the third edition of the V&amp;amp;A Parasol Foundation Prize for Women in Photography,&quot; said the committee, reflecting on the winners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Each artist represents a bold interpretation of contemporary photographic practice and conceptual responses to the prize theme, with a strong focus on community building. Their striking artistic interventions demonstrate photography’s ability to expand beyond the two-dimensional and convey empathy and sensitivity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prize is part of the V&amp;amp;A’s Parasol Foundation Women in Photography Project, which seeks to amplify the voices of female photographers, promote diversity, and encourage equality in the arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is made possible by the generous support of Ms Ruth Monicka Parasol and The Parasol Foundation Trust, an organization dedicated to empowering women in fields spanning science, health, heritage and the arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among this year’s winners is American photographer Morgan Levy, whose series &lt;em&gt;Spark of a Nail&lt;/em&gt; portrays women and non-binary individuals working in construction trades, reimagining the narratives of traditionally male-dominated labor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian artist Spandita Malik’s &lt;em&gt;Jāḷī – Meshes of Resistance&lt;/em&gt; integrates photographic transfer prints and embroidery, enabling rural women in India to shape their own representation through textile-based storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johannesburg-based Tshepiso Moropa presents &lt;em&gt;Ditoro&lt;/em&gt;, an intricate collage series that reconstructs fragments of African history into dreamlike visual narratives. Meanwhile, Lebanese photographer Tanya Traboulsi’s &lt;em&gt;Beirut, Recurring Dream&lt;/em&gt; fuses personal and archival imagery to explore the evolving identity of a post-war city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition offers a powerful testament to the strength of photography as a medium for storytelling, cultural reflection, and artistic experimentation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a strong emphasis on unity and resilience, the 2025 V&amp;amp;A Parasol Foundation Prize for Women in Photography provides a vital platform for underrepresented voices, celebrating photography’s ability to bridge past and present, personal and collective memory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vam.ac.uk/info/the-va-parasol-foundation-prize-for-women-in-photography&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;visit the official website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They all looked almost identical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to get caught up in the hype of new &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/the-best-mirrorless-camera&quot;&gt;mirrorless cameras&lt;/a&gt;; bigger sensors, higher megapixels, insane dynamic range. But here’s the reality: if your images are only living on Instagram, X or Facebook, does having the latest and greatest gear really matter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media strips images of fine details, compressing everything into the same mush of pixels. The subtle tonal gradations and resolution advantages of medium format get completely lost. The only way you’d see a difference is if you were printing, or maybe zooming in at 100%, but with compression, even that might not help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially with the way I personally shoot, black-and-white with motion blur and grain, using the Acros film simulation with minor personal adjustments. The difference between an X100F and a GFX 50S II image on a phone screen is almost nonexistent. Can you tell from the images in this article?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/cameras/compact-cameras/the-fujifilm-gfx-100rf-is-a-supersized-version-of-the-worlds-most-sought-after-camera&quot;&gt;GFX 100RF now announced by Fujifilm&lt;/a&gt;, it’s easy to get swept up in the marketing hype – I know I&#39;m guilty of it. But I would highly recommend taking a step back and asking yourself: what are you actually doing with your images? If you’re not printing large-scale, will the extra resolution and dynamic range really change anything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote an article about how &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/cameras/dslr-cameras/i-dusted-off-my-old-nikon-d750-dslr-for-one-last-shoot-can-it-still-perform-in-2025&quot;&gt;I used my Nikon D750 again for the first time in a couple of years&lt;/a&gt;, and as expected it performed brilliantly. The images are as good today as they were when the camera was first released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say gear doesn’t matter, of course. For certain types of photography, like &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-camera-for-wildlife&quot;&gt;wildlife&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-cameras-for-sports-photography&quot;&gt;sports&lt;/a&gt;, you need the right tools. But if your main output is social media, the camera in your hand is probably already good enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the key takeaway is that the most important thing is finding gear that works for you. If you primarily publish on social media, then how a camera enables you to work and create is far more important than the latest specs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not about having the highest megapixels or the newest features, it&#39;s about choosing tools that match your style, workflow and the way you want to capture moments.&lt;/p&gt;

The Nokia 225 4G is a popular choice in this category, offering essential communication features without the distractions of a modern smartphone. In that light, it could be a good option if you&#39;re considering a digital detox, need a secondary emergency phone, or simply want a cheap option for basic calling and texting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nokia brand has long had a reputation for reliable, no-nonsense phones, and the 225 4G continues this tradition, providing 4G connectivity at the lowest possible price point. That makes it a good choice for users seeking simplicity, reliability and affordability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my testing, I found the Nokia 225 4G to be precisely what it claims to be: a basic communication device with a few extra frills. Its classic design evokes nostalgia for the pre-smartphone era, and its straightforward interface makes it accessible to people who find touchscreen technology difficult to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note, that here I&#39;ve reviewed the 2020 version of the Nokia 225 4G, which is the one you&#39;re most likely to find on retail websites and in phone shops. There&#39;s also a newer 2024 version, which is more expensive. The main differences are a bigger battery (1450Mah to 1150 mAh) and a USB-C port rather than a micro-USB port in the 2020 iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nokia 225 4G retails for around $59.99 in the US, £35 in the UK, and AU$110 in Australia. This makes it one of the most affordable 4G feature phones on the market, and offers good value for those wanting voice calls, texting and basic internet connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same, spending a bit more might get you significantly more functionality. Yet for some people (ie those seeking to avoid distraction), less functionality might actually preferable, so &#39;value&#39; is really in the eye of the beholder here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nokia 225 4G has a plastic build that feels light in the hand, almost like you&#39;ve picked up the dummy version from the shop shelf rather than the real thing. To be precise, it weighs a tiny 90.1g, which is a huge amount lighter than, say, the iPhone 16 Pro Max&#39;s 227g.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phone&#39;s compact dimensions (124.7 x 51 x 13.7mm) make it significantly smaller than most modern smartphones, which I also found refreshing after years of increasingly large devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone who used a phone in the early 2000s, this device&#39;s retro design will feel instantly familiar, with its traditional T9 keypad and navigation buttons offering satisfying tactile feedback. Its 2.4-inch display is tiny by modern standards but bigger than, for example, the 1.8-inch on the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tech/phones/nokia-110-4g-review-a-cheap-burner-phone-with-a-battery-that-lasts-for-weeks&quot;&gt;Nokia 110 4G&lt;/a&gt;, and it&#39;s all you really need for the phone&#39;s limited functions. I found it a bit difficult to read in direct sunlight on occasions, but it&#39;s fine in most conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that&#39;s slightly irritating is the lack of a hardware volume rocker, requiring you to adjust volume during calls. On the whole, though, the keypad is well-spaced and comfortable to use, as long as you&#39;re used to old-style T9 keyboards. (I found it was like riding a bike, although youngsters who grew up with smartphones and have never used a T9 may well be baffled.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pleasingly, the removable back panel gives access to the replaceable battery, SIM slots and microSD card slot; a feature increasingly rare in modern phones. I loved the fact that it was easy to remove: just pop the bottom of the panel with your fingernail, no tools needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s also a 3.5mm headphone jack, which you can use to listen to MP3s and the in-built FM radio, though actually the built-in speaker is quite loud for such a small device, so I didn&#39;t always need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the call quality on the Nokia 225 4G to be good, with clear audio and a decent level of volume. The phone supports HD Voice on compatible networks, which noticeably improves call clarity. During my testing, I experienced no dropped calls or connection issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Battery life is excellent, with the 1150mAh battery offering over six hours of talk time and several days of standby. This is significantly better than most smartphones, but less than some older feature phones due to the power demands of 4G VoLTE calling, so there&#39;s a compromise to be made there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of basic features, the Nokia 225 4G performs… okay. The web browser is functional but frustrating to use with the small screen and T9 keypad. The included games, including the classic Snake, are fun but very basic, and mainly seemed designed to induce nostalgia for simpler times. The music player and FM radio work well, though as you&#39;d expect, audio quality through the in-built speaker is tinny. Alternatively, you could always use Bluetooth to connect to a decent speaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing this phone doesn&#39;t have, though, is Wi-Fi. And while you can use 4G via your mobile carrier, it doesn&#39;t offer tethering so you can&#39;t use it as a mobile hotspot. On the plus side, I also appreciated the fact it has a bunch of extras including a small torch, a voice recorder (which worked pretty well), 10 simple games (including Snake), a calculator, and a calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, the 0.3MP VGA camera on this device is extremely basic, producing grainy, low-resolution images reminiscent of early 2000s camera phones. That said, they were both bigger and better than the shots I took with the Nokia 110 4G, which were significantly more distorted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the whole, though, this camera&#39;s photos are heavily saturated and lack detail, making it useful only for the most basic needs reference shots. Or maybe you purposely want that effect for an art project or quirky social media post. In which case, knock yourself out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing people use their smartphones a lot for these days is photographing text for reference, such as a bus timetable. While many feature phones, such as the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tech/phones/nokia-110-4g-review-a-cheap-burner-phone-with-a-battery-that-lasts-for-weeks&quot;&gt;Nokia 110 4G&lt;/a&gt; and Nokia 3310, are useless at this task, the Nokia 225 4G did an okay job. Text was readable, just, when I zoomed in both on the phone itself and when uploaded to my laptop. Only just, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also shoot very basic, low-res video with the same camera. I can&#39;t think of any reason you&#39;d want to, but maybe you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nokia 225 4G is exactly what it sets out to be: a simple feature phone at a budget-friendly price. I liked the size and shape, found the keyboard easy to use, and found the 2.4-inch screen a nice size for a feature phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s slightly more expensive than the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tech/phones/nokia-110-4g-review-a-cheap-burner-phone-with-a-battery-that-lasts-for-weeks&quot;&gt;Nokia 110 4G&lt;/a&gt;, but the screen is nicer and the photos slightly better. It&#39;s broadly on a par with the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tech/phones/nokia-6310-review-relive-the-early-2000s-with-this-nostalgic-feature-phone&quot;&gt;Nokia 6310&lt;/a&gt;, which has a slightly nicer keyboard but on the downside, can&#39;t take video unless you insert a memory card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&#39;d recommend this to anyone seeking a simple phone to help you digitally detox, or a backup phone to your main smartphone. Its excellent battery life, lightweight are standout features, although be aware there&#39;s no WiFi, you can&#39;t use it as a mobile hotspot, and the 0.3MP camera is only good for the most basic reference shots.&lt;/p&gt;

It plays a huge part in the instant results. Polaroid film comprises 12 different layers, with the instant camera giant explaining that each layer is “thinner than a human hair.” &lt;em&gt;Yikes!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These rollers break the seal, housing the developer paste, and spread the paste evenly between what Polaroid calls the negative and positive sheet layers, causing a chemical reaction that develops the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what’s so astounding about this behind-the-scenes video is the revelation that: “Each roll of negative and positive sheetlayer can be slightly different,” owing to variables in temperature, chemistry, and more. So, rather astonishingly, Polaroid&#39;s photography chemists have to tweak the developer paste to match the negative and positive sheet layers being used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you check out Polaroid&#39;s &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHLu2UdtT5L/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Reel&lt;/a&gt; to see this incredible process in action!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Night photography&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;category &lt;/strong&gt;– &#39;Doom&#39; by Marian Kuric (Slovakia): &quot;Photographing the volcano was fun, but at the same time, it was dangerous. The valley turned into complete devastation within just a few days.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Junior&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;category &lt;/strong&gt;– &#39;Guardians Of The Hive&#39; by Rithved Girishkumar (United Arab Emirates): &quot;I captured a close-up of bees guarding their hive entrance, clustered and alert. Their vigilant posture and intricate faces, coupled with the rough texture of the hive, highlight the teamwork and resilience of these tiny creatures. This scene beautifully showcases their dedication to protecting their colony and the natural intricacies of their daily routine.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Architecture&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;category &lt;/strong&gt;– &#39;Nordic Elegance&#39; by Shyjith Ondencheriyath (United Arab Emirates): &quot;This architectural gem at the Finland Pavilion, Dubai Expo, embodies Nordic minimalism with its sleek white façade and clean lines. Blending modern innovation with natural simplicity, it reflects Finland&#39;s commitment to sustainability and technology in a strikingly elegant design.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manipulation and AI&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;category &lt;/strong&gt;– &#39;Open Question&#39; by Alena Ivochkina (Russian Federation): &quot;Constantly exploring new ideas, I often escape into a fantasy world. My &#39;head on a string&#39; symbolizes the link between reality and imagination. This photo combines a self-portrait and a landscape I captured, merged through manual collaging in a photo editor – entirely without AI.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before and after the ceremony, Xposure Festival attendees could get up close to the work of the finalists in a dedicated gallery space off one of the venue&#39;s entrances – this was one of more than 100 large galleries at Xposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With plenty of space on each display to enjoy a large number of framed prints from both Middle Eastern and global photographers, Xposure is surely one of the best places in the world to enjoy and appreciate the power of visual storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep up to date with future festival developments and timings via the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://xposure.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Xposure website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I don&#39;t agree</title><description>&lt;p&gt;So what’s the point of a quick-release plate? It seems obvious enough, doesn’t it: you attach the plate to the base of the camera and, from there on, you can quickly clip the camera to the tripod and unclip it any time you like for some handheld shots before you clip it back on for more tripod work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-tripod&quot;&gt;best tripods&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-ball-heads-for-tripods&quot;&gt;best tripod heads&lt;/a&gt; use quick-release plates these days. What’s wrong with that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, in my book, there’s two things. First, that’s not how I personally use a tripod. If I need a tripod, I attach the camera, do my tripod shots and then put the tripod away again. I’ve never felt the pressing need to keep taking the camera off for some handheld shots and then put it back on again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if I need to change position, I pick up the tripod with the camera still attached and move somewhere else. Or, if I need to move a longer distance, I will take the camera off, but I don’t feel as if I’ve saved any significant time from using a quick-release plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:4032px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;m55AACrNfvuG6ndXcjsukg&quot; name=&quot;IMG_1741.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tripod head attachment&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m55AACrNfvuG6ndXcjsukg.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;4032&quot; height=&quot;2268&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s my Manfrotto tripod and head with its quick release plate. So now attaching my camera takes two steps not one. How is that progress? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Rod Lawton)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the second thing, and this is just simple logic. If you use a quick release plate, you must first attach the plate to the camera and then attach both to the tripod head. That’s two actions. If you use an old-fashioned tripod head that screws straight into the camera base, that’s one action. And one less component, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, I find it much easier to spin the grip on an old-fashioned head directly into the camera base and secure it, than I do to find where I’ve put the hex key for my QR plate or look for a coin I don’t have to tighten up a slotted screw. Butterfly nuts are okay, though, because they don’t need any special tools. They should be compulsory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-else-is-wrong-with-quick-release-plates-2&quot;&gt;So what (else) is wrong with quick release plates?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manfrotto for a long time used a custom plate design of its own, which doesn’t fit other tripod heads. And while Arca Swiss style plates have become a new standard among tripod and head makers, not all plates fit all heads – depending on whether the makers use locating pins or other design tweaks and whether you’re dealing with locking screws or sprung clamps, which may need a different tension setting for different plates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitting QR plates to cameras can be a bit of a chore, so one answer is to leave them fixed to the camera all the time. So what’s the problem with that? Well, one problem is that the camera will no longer sit properly on a flat surface. Another problem is more tragic: a tale of waste and disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long, long time, a corner of the Digital Camera World testing lab was filled with orphaned tripods, separated by carelessness from their quick-release plates. These were probably still attached to some camera now far, far away or left rattling around abandoned in the bottom of an old camera bag because nobody could remember where they came from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I realize, though, that I’m wasting my time even complaining about this. It’s almost impossible now to get an old-school tripod head that attaches directly to the camera. I’m stuck with using more complex QR systems that should really be described in full as Quick-Release-Slow-Attach plates. Grrr.&lt;/p&gt;

Mann’s career spans over four decades, defined by her hauntingly beautiful black-and-white images exploring family, memory, and the American South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mann&#39;s series &lt;em&gt;Immediate Family&lt;/em&gt; (1984-91) remains one of the most provocative and discussed works of the late 20th century, capturing intimate moments of youth with a raw, poetic sensibility. Beyond portraiture, her landscapes – particularly in &lt;em&gt;Deep South&lt;/em&gt; (2005) – are steeped in history, evoking themes of decay and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mann’s influence on contemporary photography is profound, and this award recognizes her ingrained mark on the medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other 2025 CPW Vision Award recipients include Tyler Mitchell, who receives the Photographer of the Year award for his vibrant, era-defining work in fashion and portraiture, and Qiana Mestrich, honored with the Saltzman Prize for Emerging Photographer for her thought-provoking collages that examine race, identity, and the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond celebrating photography’s finest, the event also supports CPW’s ongoing commitment to fostering emerging voices through its artist residency, Woodstock AIR. Now in its 26th year, the program provides crucial support for artists working in photography, ensuring that the conversation around diversity and representation continues to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s honorees will be celebrated at a gala event on May 10 2025, at CPW’s newly renovated headquarters in Kingston, New York.

They’ve been my go-to flashguns for the last couple of years and I’ve loved the power, versatility, and reliability both for camera-mounted and off-camera use, the latter with a Godox wireless RF trigger. The only thing I’ve criticized the flashguns for is their old-fashioned control panels which look and feel a decade or two out of date. The V100 puts that right with a new color touchscreen interface and a raft of other upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/godox-v1-flashgun-review&quot;&gt;Godox V1&lt;/a&gt; was very much a round-headed version of the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/godox-ving-v860iii-ttl-flashgun-review&quot;&gt;VING V860III&lt;/a&gt;. There’s certainly nothing wrong with that, as they had super stamina and very fast recycling speeds, based on a Li-ion battery. The main difference was that the V1’s round instead of rectangular tube delivered a softer and smoother light, featuring a front lens that aimed to give a more gradual falloff towards the circumference and eliminate a central hot spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/godox-v1pro-flashgun-review-the-best-value-pro-flash-has-a-new-gimmick&quot;&gt;V1Pro&lt;/a&gt; added USB-C charging and a new battery, plus a clip-on sub-flash module for fill-flash illumination in bounce-flash mode. Let’s see what the new V100 brings to the party, as it aims for a place among &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/the-best-flashgun&quot;&gt;the best flashguns&lt;/a&gt; on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite flashgun setups is a pair of rectangular-headed &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/godox-ving-v860iii-ttl-flashgun-review&quot;&gt;Godox VING V860III&lt;/a&gt; which I use on-camera or remotely with a Godox XPro TTL wireless RF trigger. The setup is amazing value for such a powerful kit, the flashguns costing $229 / £179 / AU$329 each and the trigger costing $69 / £66 / AU$129. The original &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/godox-v1-flashgun-review&quot;&gt;Godox V1&lt;/a&gt; round-headed flashgun is a little pricier at $259 / £239 / AU$370 and the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/godox-v1pro-flashgun-review-the-best-value-pro-flash-has-a-new-gimmick&quot;&gt;V1Pro&lt;/a&gt; is a step up again at $329 / £308 / AU$549.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the hike in power and new color touchscreen interface of the latest V100, I reckon it’s equally great value at $349 / £339 / AU$610. Incidentally, the XPro TTL trigger is compatible with all of the V1, V1Pro and V100 round-headed flashguns but a more seamless fit for the V100 is the newer &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/news/has-godox-just-changed-the-game-for-camera-flash-triggers&quot;&gt;Godox X3 / Xnano&lt;/a&gt; wireless RF trigger which also features a newer style color touchscreen, and costs $89 / £79 / AU$149.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-godox-v100-design-handling&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Godox V100: Design &amp;amp; Handling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most flashguns have a maximum power rating that’s quoted as a ‘Guide number’, along the lines of Gn60 with ISO and meters or feet being taken into the equation. The Godox V100 follows on from its predecessors with a ‘Watt second’ rating, more often used in studio flashheads. And there’s a sizeable power-up over the previous V1 and V1Pro, which were rated at 76Ws, the V100 topping out at 100Ws. That’s mighty powerful for a hot-shoe-based on-camera flash, although it still falls short of most standalone flash heads, like the 200Ws &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/cameras/camera-lights/godox-ad200-pro-ii-review&quot;&gt;Godox AD200 Pro II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:4480px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;7sifAgrC9NAtYiR4TvPoXF&quot; name=&quot;Godox V100 7237.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Godox V100 flashgun product image&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7sifAgrC9NAtYiR4TvPoXF.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;4480&quot; height=&quot;2520&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;What’s in the box? The V100 flashgun comes complete with a carrying pouch, tabletop/tripod stand, clip-on sub-flash module, Li-ion battery, mains charger (varies per region) and charging cable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Matthew Richards)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with an increase in power, the V100 boasts a faster turn of speed. Hi-speed sync supports shutter speeds of up to 1/80,000&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of a second, making it fully compatible with cameras that feature a ‘global shutter’, like the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/sony-a9-iii-review&quot;&gt;Sony A9 III&lt;/a&gt;. I also really like the blisteringly fast recycle speeds. These are virtually instantaneous at power settings up to and including 1/4 power output. This puts high-speed continuous shooting on the menu, complete with flash, for when you’re trying to nail a definitive moment in sports, wildlife, or press photography, as well as for catching fleeting expressions in portraiture or at events like weddings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you’re not just limited to shooting in short bursts, thanks to the V100’s new cooling system. Even at full power output, you can take up to 100 consecutive shots and the flashgun will keep a cool head. At least, that’s the case in the 80-105mm section of the flash zoom range, although it drops off to between 70 and 90 shots in the 28-70mm zoom sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:4190px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;zyyKfugw8CrNYjPpWq8CWF&quot; name=&quot;Godox V100 7219.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Godox V100 flashgun product image&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zyyKfugw8CrNYjPpWq8CWF.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;4190&quot; height=&quot;2356&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The V100 has an upgraded cooling system that enables up to 100 or so consecutive shots even at full power output. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Matthew Richards)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the powerful 100W rating, the 2980mAh battery has sufficient stamina for up to 400 full-power flashes on a full charge (down from 500 shots in the V1Pro). Naturally, you’ll get very many more flashes per charge at lower power settings. An upgrade over the original V1 is that the newer VB30 battery has its own USB-C port that enables fast charging, as used in the V1Pro. You can also run the flashgun from a mains adapter or power bank via the USB-C port.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional VB30 batteries, should you feel the need, cost around $55 / £51 / AU$94 each. Another alternative is that you can buy a separate, optional Godox PB960 battery pack for $120 / £105 / AU$175 that feeds the flashgun via an umbilical cord. One advantage of this is that the recycle time after a full-power flash is boosted from about 1.7 seconds to just 0.8 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like the full range of flash modes and adjustments featured in the V100. Full TTL dedication is available with separate Canon, Nikon, Sony, Fujifilm, OM System and Pentax versions of the flashgun. There is a -7 to 120 degrees of vertical bounce and 150 or 180 degrees of swivel to left and right, respectively. The motorized zoom head has a 28-105mm range (in full-frame terms). That’s not overly generous in the scale of things but is due to the round-head nature of the flashgun, whereas the rectangular V860III has a 20-200mm zoom range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The V100 features a red AF assist light which is useful for DSLRs, although it’s incompatible with mirrorless cameras. To get around that problem, there’s also a pretty powerful LED modeling light built into the main flash tube, which works for AF assist as well as for modeling. Advanced flash modes include the typical up-market range of High-speed sync, rear-curtain, and programmable repeat (or strobe). The last of these is ideal for sequential flashes throughout a long exposure, for special effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike some flashguns that only contain a built-in RF receiver, or no RF connectivity at all, the V100 continues the Godox tradition of featuring an RF transceiver. This enables you to use the flashgun as either a master or slave unit in multi-flashgun setups. It’s based on a 2.4GHz transmission and features five groups and 32 channels, with a range of up to 100m / 328 feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve saved perhaps the biggest new feature until last, and that’s the color touchscreen interface. As I’ve mentioned, the interface of previous recent Godox flashguns seemed quite antiquated to me. The mono screen and row of context-sensitive buttons for the various functions also looked pretty dull. By sharp contrast, the color touchscreen of the V100 looks and feels bang up to date. You also get options for adjusting power output in the usual fractions of full power down to 1/256 power levels, or on a scale of 2.0 to 10, the latter being more akin to studio flash heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:6048px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;jDQRwEygk5thLvNSoxLNcF&quot; name=&quot;Godox V100 7217.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Godox V100 flashgun product image&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jDQRwEygk5thLvNSoxLNcF.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;6048&quot; height=&quot;3400&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;As well as full master/slave RF wireless capabilities, the V100 features two modes of optical slave for use with studio flash heads or other flashguns, plus a 2.5mm sync terminal for cable connected synchronization. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Matthew Richards)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mostly love the touchscreen interface and only have two minor niggles. Firstly, switching the flashgun on is a two-stage process. Instead of simply pressing and holding the power on/off button to switch on the V100, you have press the button and then rotate the rotary dial or apply the same action on the touchscreen once the screen comes to life. It seems an unnecessary extra step to me. Secondly, I liked that the rotary dial in previous versions also worked as a 4-way pad. For example, you could increase or decrease the power output in full increments with up/down presses, or in 1/10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; increments with left/right presses. Sliding the power bar on the touchscreen to set the output can feel a little hit and miss by comparison, and the +/- touch points are only for small 1/10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; increments of change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The gallery of images below shows what’s on offer in the color touchscreen interface.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said at the outset, a main selling point of the previous V1 and V1Pro flashguns is that their round heads with a special lens built into the front deliver a lovely quality of light, which is softer and with a nice gradual falloff towards the circumference, while also eliminating the central hot spot for which rectangular flashguns are notorious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another bonus of the round flash head, as far as I’m concerned, is that it gives more natural looking catchlights in the eyes when you’re taking portraits. This advantage is largely lost if you use the clip-on sub-flash module, but the sub-flash can work really well for still life photography and other scenarios where you want to use bounce flash for softness while adding a little direct flash to add detail or reduce the depth of shadows. I like that the output or the sub-flash module is independently adjustable on a sliding scale, via the color touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For further enhancing the quality of light, I’m pleased that Godox offers a range of modifiers, which are easy to attach to the V100 via magnetic attraction, just like with the previous V1 and V1Pro. Favorites include the Godox AK-R22 collapsible diffusion dome at $27 / £25 / AU$45 and the Godox AK-R1 accessory kit at $56 / £58 / AU$85. The latter is especially good value, comprising a diffusion dome, three warming filters, a green filter, a filter holder, snoot, honeycomb grid, 4-way barndoor set and bounce card with frame.&lt;/p&gt;

You can also power the flashgun directly from a USB outlet using this socket. An additional USB socket on the other side of the flashgun is featured for applying firmware updates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Matthew Richards)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of outright flash power, I found that the V100 only gave a slight increase over the previous V1 and V1Pro editions, equating to about 1/3 of a stop in my tests. What really did impress me is that at any manual power setting, there’s very little difference in the intensity of output throughout the entire 35-105mm section of the zoom range. I only really noticed a drop-off at the shortest 28mm zoom setting. I really like this for when I’m using manual power settings rather than TTL flash metering, and changing between different focal lengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As advertised, recycle speeds are super-fast. I found virtually no lag at all when using power settings of 1/256 right up to 1/4 power. Even at 1/2 power output, recycle speed was a quick 0.8 seconds, dropping to 1.7 seconds after a full-power flash. As I’ve mentioned, you can speed up the recycle time after a full-power flash to just 0.8 seconds if you buy the optional Godox PB960 external battery pack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We test all available features for each flashgun that goes through out labs. To test power output, we used a Sekonic flash meter placed at a distance of one meter from each flashgun. We check the complete range of manual power settings, in one-stop increments. Based on a sensitivity of ISO 100, the figures correlate directly with the Gn (Guide number). The results are double-checked by taking shots of a gray card with the appropriate lens apertures and using the camera’s histogram display in playback mode. This is done for flash zoom settings of 24mm, 50mm and 105mm (in full-frame terms), where available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also check the accuracy and consistency of electronic/intelligent TTL (Through The Lens) flash metering, and the speed with which each flashgun can recycle to a state of readiness after a full-power flash, using both Ni-MH and alkaline cells, or a Li-ion power pack where supplied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power output:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:1759px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;kRPxwwN2YLwZcqME8KhZQj&quot; name=&quot;Godox V100 - flash power&quot; alt=&quot;Godox V100 lab graph&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kRPxwwN2YLwZcqME8KhZQj.png&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1759&quot; height=&quot;990&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its smoother, more even lighting and the absence of a hot spot, maximum output power isn’t quite as strong as with some top-end rectangular flashguns, as measured at the center of the image frame. However, power output is remarkably consistent throughout the 35-105mm sector of the zoom range, only dropping off a little at the shortest 28mm setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TTL accuracy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve come to expect from flashguns that run on a Li-ion battery rather than alkaline or Ni-MH AA batteries, recycling speeds are very fast. However, in the 1/2 to full power sector of the power range, the V100 isn’t quite as fast as the original Godox V1 or V1Pro, due to its greater output power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-godox-v100-verdict&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Godox V100: Verdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my money, the Godox V100 is the most desirable flashgun on the market right now. It’s very powerful, has a full set of advanced features and functions, and runs on a Li-ion battery that enables excellent stamina and very quick recycling speed even after a full-power flash. Meanwhile, the advanced cooling system enables long bursts of continuous shooting. The new color touchscreen is very well implemented and makes advanced functions more intuitive to use and quicker to get at. All in all, it’s a spectacular flashgun that’s available in a wide range of dedicated options to suit most makes of camera, and it’s excellent value at the price.&lt;/p&gt;

The tool uses Meta AI to examine the image and suggest brief comments, so the commenter doesn’t have to write something from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test, first spotted by &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://x.com/jonah_manzano/status/1901006620530024842&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;social media trends tester Jonah Manzano&lt;/a&gt; but confirmed in &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/21/meta-spotted-testing-ai-generated-comments-on-instagram/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a comment to TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;, suggests three comments based on the contents of the image. Users click on a “help me write” icon after tapping on the comment icon to access the feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a screenshot of the feature, when the commenting tool is used, Meta AI “can analyze photos, including facial features, to help you write.” In a video of the tool, the AI looks at a selfie taken in a living room and suggests comments like “cute living room setup” and “love the cozy atmosphere.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of AI analyzing images could miff some photographers, but it’s not a completely new notion; Meta has already tested a similar feature on Facebook. My Facebook feed is filled with AI suggesting questions to ask underneath a photo, including what often feels like strange personal questions that an AI shouldn’t have the answer to anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Instagram comment section has long drawn criticism for bot-written comments and spam. You can, for example, use a third-party tool to buy randomly generated comments to trick the algorithm into delivering a post to more feeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the platform added new tools for creators that &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://creators.instagram.com/blog/creator-empowerment#:~:text=We&#39;ve%20improved%20our%20automated,and%20spammy%20tags%20in%20bulk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;would help filter out bot comments and fake followers&lt;/a&gt;. The tested feature feels a bit like the opposite of those tools. After all, isn’t AI a bot?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, however, as Meta has been focusing on AI to deliver many of the latest features. Last year, Instagram began rolling out AI Studio to select creators, enabling them&lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/meta-enable-influencers-create-ai-versions-themselves/720114/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; to create an AI version of themselves&lt;/a&gt; to respond to fans’ DMs.&lt;/p&gt;

Sony E-Mount shooters now have another option to shoot small: the TTArtisan 14mm f/3.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TTArtisan AF 14mm f/3.5 is an APS-C E-Mount lens, designed for pairing with Sony’s smaller crop sensor cameras in the A6XXX and ZV series. Like the cameras that it is intended for, the 14mm lens is a compact, lightweight design weighing in at just 98g / 3.5 oz. Despite the low weight and pancake presentation, &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://ttartisan.store/products/ttartisan-af-14mm-f3-5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;TTArtisans says&lt;/a&gt; the lensboasts a metal body constructed from aviation-grade aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 14mm lens captures a wide, 92° field of view on those crop sensor cameras, which is equivalent to a 21mm lens in the full-frame format. The optics include eight elements arranged in seven groups. The design also includes a USB-C port in the mount for later firmware updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the AF in the name implies, the lens is equipped with an autofocus motor. It’s capable of locking on to subjects as close as 0.25m / 9.8 inches away. The lens uses a stepping motor for that autofocus and the company says the lens is compatible with eye, face, animal and car subject detection on bodies with those features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orders for the lens have already opened, with the TTArtisan AF 14mm f/3.5 &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F24HPTBJ/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;sponsored&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;retailing for $129&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/TTARTISAN-Camera-Mount-APS-C-Ultra-Wide/dp/B0DMF8XW4L&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;sponsored&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;£140&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com.au/TTARTISAN-Pancake-Autofocus-Portable-Compatible/dp/B0DMDNF1N6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;sponsored&quot;&gt;AU$229&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Back at the time the first mirrorless camera were coming onto the market, Ricoh took a radically different approach to making an interchangeble lens camera that was smaller than a DSLR. It&#39;s whacky idea was a camera where you changed both the lens and the sensor at the same time - using a series of modules.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been seeing how the GXR stack up in 2025 - but before I get to that, here is the history…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-the-history&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The history&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the middle of 2009 and the photography world is starting to get to grips with a whole new breed of camera. First Panasonic at the previous year’s Photokina and then Olympus repackaged the Four Thirds format sensor – now renamed Micro Four Thirds – into interchangeable lens cameras which did away with the traditional SLR mirror box and optical viewfinder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panasonic opted for having an integrated electronic viewfinder in its Lumix G1 giving a design reminiscent of a very compact DSLR while the Olympus PEN E-P1 adopted a styling very similar to that of its Pen F half frame 35mm, but which didn’t have an eyelevel viewfinder at all.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both these cameras were significantly smaller and lighter than even the most compact DSLR which was achieved partially by using the MFT sensor and also by eliminating the bulky reflex assembly at the heart of both film and digital SLRs. While the term ‘mirrorless’ is universally used now, early on, a widely-used classification was ‘Compact System Camera’ (CSC) which neatly summed up what they were… compact camera bodies in a system of lenses and accessories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody knew where CSCs were heading except that ‘compact’ was the big selling point for both the bodies and the lenses. Enthusiasts didn’t really take them all that seriously and the early marketing was certainly aimed at the users of fixed-lens compacts who wanted to upgrade to something with more versatility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2010, Samsung stepped up a sensor size with its ‘APS-C’ format NX-10 which was still very compact compared to any DSLR using this sensor size, but there was still a belief that smaller was better so Pentax introduced the Q line in June 2011 and the 1 Nikon system appeared just a couple of months later.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tiny Q series cameras were initially built around a 6.77x4.55 mm BSI CMOS that was very compact indeed. The former, called the S10, had a BSI-type CMOS mated with a zoom equivalent to 24-72mm f/2.5-4.4 which was also exceptionally compact. In both cases, the ‘10’ referred to the effective resolution in megapixels. There were two A12 modules – so, ‘APS-C’ sensors with an effective resolution of 12.3 megapixels – with prime lenses; namely (effectively) a 50mm f/2.3 and a 28mm f/2.5. The M mount unit used a similar sensor with the same resolution and then, finally, there was the A16 module which combined a 16.2 megapixels ‘APS-C’ sensor with a 24-85mm f/3.5-5.5 zoom, and was the biggest and bulkiest of them all.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was possibly the A16’s size that suggested what had looked like a clever idea at the time of its launch maybe couldn’t be developed very much further. There was also a bit of an identity crisis – was it really only a compact camera with some added versatility or something more serious? And the pixel war was raging which raised the issue of how upgrades might be handled… you’d have to buy a new lens as well as the higher-res sensor and faster processor. It would have been easy to update the body with, for example, an adjustable monitor screen, but down the track, it started to become obvious that the module concept would be problematic, particularly in terms of implementing new technologies. In a way then, its advantages were also its disadvantages. Perhaps after the megapixel race calmed down and the resolution of ‘APS-C’ sensors settled at where it is now – in the region of 20 to 26 MP – there might not have been so much of an imperative to upgrade the modules, but as we’re now seeing, it’s more about more powerful processors which can perform complex functions such as AI-based subject recognition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ricoh GXR system was launched at the end of 2009 and the last new module, the A16, in February 2012 by which time Panasonic, Sony, Samsung and Olympus were building mirrorless camera systems with bigger choices of lenses and bodies with more features and better capabilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the competition was hotting up with the arrival in early 2012 of Fujifilm’s X mount system – introduced with the X-Pro1 – and then, mid-year, Canon’s EOS M system, both using ‘APS-C’ size sensors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowly but surely the formula for mirrorless cameras was taking shape and it was evolving to use only the ‘mainstream’ sensor sizes – the first full frame bodies were not far away – and a conventional lens mount. More significantly, what had initially been considered an ILC category supplementary to DSLRs was emerging as their replacement… and the Ricoh GXR was never going to stack up here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ricoh’s original road map had plans for up to 20 lens modules and there was talk of full-frame units down the track, but in the end there were just five plus the M mount model. There were also ideas for other components that could use the 68-pin connection, including a projector, a large capacity data storage unit and a mini photo printer that would have turned the GXR into an instant camera, but none of these went into production. After no new product activity for over three years, the system was finally announced as discontinued in late 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, none of this history prevents the Ricoh GXR being a really interesting proposition today, not just because the concept still has merit, but because it actually works well as a compact interchangeable lens camera system. If you accept that ‘it is was it is’, the GXR has plenty going for it and it’s a lot of fun to use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The A16 module obviously delivers the most resolution compared to contemporary ‘APS-C’ mirrorless cameras and its 24-85mm zoom performs well. However,&amp;nbsp;12.3 megapixels is still a reasonably useful amount of resolution for many applications and both the prime lenses are very good indeed with the 50mm also labelled ‘macro’ as it focuses down to seven centimetres which gives a maximum magnification ratio of half life size. With RAW capture – which uses the Adobe DNG format – the A12 modules deliver a file size of around 20 MB (depending on the subject content, of course) and a maximum JPEG quality of close to 5.0 MB. The A16 unit – which uses a Sony-made sensor – generates average file sizes of 24 MB and 6.0 MB respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arguably, the most interesting of the GXR modules is the Mount A12 unit which, as noted earlier, combines the Leica M mount with a modified version of the 12.3 MP ‘APS-C’ sensor which doesn’t have&amp;nbsp;an optical low-pass (or anti-aliasing) filter. Additionally, it has both a focal plane shutter with a top speed of /4000 second and a sensor-based shutter that runs up to 1/8000 second. Of course, there’s a focal length magnification factor of 1.5x – as there was with the Leica’s M8 – but otherwise, this module turned the GXR into a very neat little digital M mount camera… not to mention a comparatively affordable one too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better still, the GXR body can be fitted with a plug-in EVF – the compact VF-2 – which is tilt-adjustable and has a resolution of 920,000 dots (same as the monitor screen), but obviously looks a lot sharper because of &amp;nbsp;the much smaller &amp;nbsp;screen. The VF-2 is handy with any of the lens modules, but makes an M mount GXR into a great little package… and the system is young enough to have a focus peaking display to assist with manual focusing. It’s only in white and at a single intensity, but it’s still more useful than the classic rangefinder in terms of showing exactly what’s sharp and what isn’t. There’s a second option which renders the live view the image as a B&amp;amp;W negative so it’s easier to see the peaking display – but obviously it needs to be switched on and off – so the color mode is more convenient. Alternatively, there’s a magnified image display with settings of 2x, 4x or 8x.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the M mount module was a big hit and possibly helped sell more GXR body units than any of the others. Indeed, initially Ricoh had plans for more of what it called ‘extension units’ with mounts primarily for fitting legacy lenses. These lens mount modules could have been a way to keep the system going, perhaps with the updated body suggested earlier. A K mount option would have made a lot of sense, but Ricoh had purchased Pentax in July 2011 and the Pentax K-01 – a K mount mirrorless camera – was launched in February 2012 so avoiding competitive products may&amp;nbsp;have stymied that idea. Also, licensing would likely have been an issue, although it wouldn’t be too long before Sony was handing out E/FE mount invitations to all and sundry, and the MFT group would likely have welcomed a new member of Ricoh’s caliber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the earliest components of the system now being over 15 years old, the Ricoh GXR doesn’t lag so very far behind compared to today’s compact mirrorless cameras as far as still photography is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video, of course, is another story and this is where a lot of the recent progress has been made, but it was a feature yet&amp;nbsp;to gain any traction at the end of the&amp;nbsp;‘noughties’. The best you can get is HD res (i.e. 720p and not Full HD) at either 24 or 30 fps in either MPEG-4 or AVI Motion JPEG depending on the lens module, and only with mono sound via the built-in mic. There’s no manual controls – except, of course, for focusing when you’re using the M mount module – and no connection for an external microphone so, even when it was new, video wasn’t the GXR’s strong point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For photography, the period features are contrast-detection AF with nine measuring points, continuous shooting speeds of between 2.5 and 5.0 fps depending on&amp;nbsp;the module, and a less-than-logical menu layout. However, the AF is still reasonably brisk and there’s a handy ‘Snap Focus’ mode which can be preset to one of eight distance settings from one metre to infinity which are automatically set – virtually instantaneously – when the shutter is button is depressed (and with half-press or full-press options). This feature continues in the current &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/ricoh-gr-iiix-review&quot;&gt;Ricoh GR IIIx&lt;/a&gt; fixed-lens compacts as does the multi-point white balance measurement which was actually first introduced in the CX series compacts. This takes multiple measurements across the frame and the colour balance is then adjusted area by area rather than by applying an average setting. This takes into account that different parts of a scene are often differently illuminated or have different colour balances (i.e. broad sunlight and shadow).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:3748px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;aYmz4RpVpMQJ5txSQwP57H&quot; name=&quot;_DSF7383.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Ricoh GXR&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aYmz4RpVpMQJ5txSQwP57H.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;3748&quot; height=&quot;2634&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Paul Burrows / Australia Camera Magazine)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s auto bracketing for white balance as well as exposure, ISO and for colour whereby three frames are recorded, one in the preselected colour, one in B&amp;amp;W and one with a preset monochrome tint. The color setting options are Vivid, Standard and Natural, but you can create two of your own, while the toning/tint effects for B&amp;amp;W are sepia, red, green, blue and purple. The Scene modes include the staples for portraiture, landscapes, close-ups, sports action and night photography while, later, special effects were added via a firmware upgrade and these included Soft Focus, Cross Process, Toy Camera, Miniaturise and High Contrast B&amp;amp;W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By today’s standards the GXR is still pretty well featured including with all the manual controls and overrides you’d expect on a new mirrorless camera. There’s noise reduction, high ISO noise reduction (adjustable for threshold from ISO 200 to 3200), dynamic range expansion, white balance correction (set via a colour square), distortion correction and auto aperture or shutter speed shifting (depending on the exposure mode). Post capture, you can edit in-camera with Auto/Manual Levels Corrections (which works the same way&amp;nbsp;it does in Photoshop), White Balance Compensation and Skew Correction. There’s also an intervalometer (set for up to 99 frames or unlimited), a programmable self-timer and copyright info input.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-handling&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Handling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the bulkiest A16 module fitted, the GXR is still a very compact camera. The main body dimensions aren’t far off those of the GR III models, but obviously the lens units add extra depth… although not very much in the case of the S10 and P10. Add-on EVFs always look a bit clumsy, but it’s definitely worth having so worth tracking down if you’re looking at a preloved body without one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the system’s launch, Ricoh emphasized the reliability and durability&amp;nbsp;of the 68-pin interface and the guide rail arrangement that ensures a reliable coupling between the GXR body and the lens units. It’s not entirely goof-proof because you can misalign the two components and they’ll still lock into place, but it should be very obvious visually and, in case you still miss it, the camera refuses to play ball until&amp;nbsp;you do something about it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coupling is undoubtedly massively over-engineered so it’s hard to see even a well-used system having any issues, but the design did prevent weather-proofing and make sure you get the clip-on rubber dust covers for both the modules and the body units… these are as important as lens and body caps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The external control layout is conventional with a main mode dial, a front input wheel and a rear ‘ADJ’ adjustment lever, a four-way keypad on the back panel and a small scattering of function buttons. There are two dedicated multi-function controls – the left/right pad actions – which can be assigned from a load of stuff plus four ‘ADJ’ lever settings for various capture-related settings including ISO, white balance, exposure compensation, the auto bracketing mode and much more. You can then cycle through what’s been assigned so you can set it up to enable quick on-the-fly adjustments of those key exposure and white balance settings. Not as quick as if you had touch screen controls, but still pretty efficient.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monitor screen itself is showing its age with its now comparatively low resolution and fixed position, but it works well enough. More of a challenge is the tiny typeface that Ricoh used in the menus and displays with both the GXR and the CX-series compacts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The menu layout comprises just three tabs so you’ll spend a lot of a time searching for things until you become familiar with where they are, but you can create up to three sets of ‘My Settings’ which are then selectable via the main menu dial. The customisable ‘ADJ’ level mentioned earlier also cuts down the number of times you’ll need to trawl the menus when shooting. However, the undoubted convenience of&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘My Menu’ pages was still before the GXR’s time. However, the displays still include all the essentials – a dual-axis level display, a real-time histogram, a highlight warning and a choice of guide grids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice then, the user experience isn’t so very much different from a current mirrorless camera, but minus the efficiencies of a touch screen monitor and a better-organised menu system. Basic set-up and operation will be familiar no matter what else you’ve been shooting with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speed-wise, the Ricoh GXR is very much of its day and, of course, we’ve been treated to some significant advances in both AF performance and continuous shooting frame rates over recent years. It’s not quick, but if you’re thinking street photography or something very compact, but capable to travel with then it’s fast enough. Of course, f you’re using the M mount module then the AF speed isn’t an issue. In terms of exposure control and white balance, the GXR is still more of a modern than a classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The R/GR series of 35mm subcompacts built a cult status on their combinationof portability and performance with a big part of the latter being the lenses. These were so good that, in fact, a small batch&amp;nbsp;of 21mm f/3.5 ultra-wide from the 35mm GR21 (2001) was offered as a manual-focus version with a Leica L39 screw mount. The dedication to high-quality optics continued with the GR lenses for the GXR which, apart from being each optically matched&amp;nbsp;to the sensor, are very highly corrected to give excellent uniformity of sharpness and brightness. There is undoubtedly some digital correction going on too, again specific to the lens and sensor combo. Consequently, the A12 primes, in particular, are exceptionally strong performers optically and well corrected for both distortion and chromatic aberrations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 24-85mm is&amp;nbsp;the pick of the zooms and is again very well corrected. It’s versatile too, and the 16.2 megapixels sensor delivers plenty of well-defined detailing along with smooth tonal gradations. Of course, noise reduction processing for JPEGs is something else that’s progressed in leaps and bounds since the GXR system components were new, so none of the sensors have sensitivity ranges that extend beyond ISO 3200, and only the A16 is capable of anything like the high ISO performance that we’d expect today. Best-quality JPEGs look fine up to ISO 800 and still pretty good at ISO 1600 which is also true of the A12 sensors, but even ISO 800 is pushing things with the S10 and P10 units with their tiny imagers… although the latter’s 28-300mm equivalent zoom is brilliantly packaged and hugely versatile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-verdict&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Verdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there had been a GXR II body with a higher res, tilt-adjustable monitor and at least a couple of 24 MP ‘APS-C’ lens modules, Ricoh’s concept would still arguably be in the mix as a compact&amp;nbsp;mirrorless camera system. The biggest impediment to long-term progress was forcing users to buy a new lens with a new sensor, and while a bunch of mount units – let’s say, K, E and M43, along with M – might have worked, what looked like a bright idea at the start quickly lost its appeal after you bought into it… if only because the conventional systems from the likes&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;of Canon, Panasonic, Samsung, Olympus and Sony were soon all offering more for less. However, it’s that original appeal that makes the GXR worth looking at today because the concept did work and, now you know the history and so don’t have any great expectations for anything more, it still works.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the 28mm and 50mm modules, the overall package is very compact, but with great quality optics and enough resolution for plenty of applications especially, as it now happens, anything you might want to do online such as social media. The M mount module is also worth considering and, of course, you can fit other classic MF lens via an adapter. This unit turns the GXR into a nifty little digital RF camera that’s actually a whole lot of fun to use, especially with the VF-2 EVF.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:5144px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;3AcpGRsAqLehjn3o5rhZya&quot; name=&quot;GXR + A12 M Mount copy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ricoh GXR&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3AcpGRsAqLehjn3o5rhZya.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;5144&quot; height=&quot;2894&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The A16’s extra resolution brings the GXR even closer to current image performance levels and, while it lacks any of the camera tech that’s appeared over the last date, it still has all the basics and quite a few frills too. Importantly, there’s all the manual controls and overrides for the experienced shooter to effectively deal with focus, exposure and white balance, plus enough for a bit of creative dabbling such as picture controls – the B&amp;amp;W mode is noticeably filmic in its look – and special effects, especially if all the firmware upgrades have been done (and there were quite a few of them along the way).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one hand, it’s easy to see why, at the time, Ricoh thought that the GXR was a good idea, and it’s equally easy to see why it would have been apparent from quite early on that it really wasn’t. But it hasn’t been a total failure because, while it may be even more of a curiosity today, it’s also still surprisingly workable and, better still, a great deal of fun to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few other unusual choices if you want to relive the early days of mirrorless cameras, including the Pentax Q and Nikon 1 miniature systems, but nothing is quite as unique as the Ricoh GXR.&lt;/p&gt;

I&#39;ve said it before, and I’ll say it again, the BF looks like a camera made by luxury audio brand Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen. I can hardly think of a better product to coincide with Sigma’s subtle yet refined rebrand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, the Sigma rebrand has been happening for years – without fanfare – as the cheap, third-party lens manufacturer quietly churned out premium-quality lens after premium-quality lens at competitive prices. If you’ve ever used a Sigma Art lens before, you’ll know that it can tussle with the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-nikon-lenses&quot;&gt;best Nikon lenses&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-canon-rf-lenses&quot;&gt;best Canon lenses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But following the rebrand proper in February this year, Sigma – at least in my eyes – should feel like the cock of the walk. And the reason why has everything to do with the way that Chinese optics have begun to dominate the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/cheap-primes-lenses&quot;&gt;cheap lens&lt;/a&gt; market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You see, there’s no denying that manufacturers like Viltrox and Laowa are darned good at what they do – I sure as heck wouldn’t want to be competing with them. But Sigma isn’t. The pivot towards premium couldn’t have come at a better moment in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:5184px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;Wgp4gdkth9Tky4c9oNxSQD&quot; name=&quot;16x9_edit_P2250365a2&quot; alt=&quot;Sigma BF on a grey surface&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wgp4gdkth9Tky4c9oNxSQD.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;5184&quot; height=&quot;2916&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The Sigma BF is one heck of a good-looking camera  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: James Artaius)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sigma BF might be the centerpiece of this new era, but I think the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/cameras/mirrorless-cameras/breaking-sigma-announces-300-600mm-f-4-dream-lens-and-breakthrough-16-300mm-f-3-5-6-7&quot;&gt;Sigma 300-600mm f/4 DG OS | Sports&lt;/a&gt; is the real evidence of Sigma’s forward-thinking genius. This monster lens (review pending) is proof that premium doesn’t have to be unaffordable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, it might seem silly to call a $5,999 / £5,899 AU$12,995 lens affordable, but when it’s a 600mm zoom with a fixed f/4 aperture that’s half (even one-third) of the price of some 600mm f/4 competitors, it&#39;s a cheap lens – but not one that has to compete with the aforementioned Chinese brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heck, it’s not competing with anyone. Clearly, Sigma has used its 60-plus years of experience in optics manufacturing to produce something very special indeed. The only problem I can see, now that Sigma has shown its cards, is how it exists alongside the big camera manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no denying that the company’s relationship with Nikon and Canon hasn’t been as chummy as in the DSLR years. And I do wonder if that’s because Sigma is simply more of a threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I for one cannot wait to see what other surprises Sigma has in the pipeline during this new era. Something tells me the Sigma BF and 300-600mm f/4 are only the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;

Well it seems to be catching on as Kodak has now followed suit with its Kodak Mobile Film Scanner – a simple portable device with an LED backlight which allows you to prop your phone on top of it to digitize them and packs away neatly for storage and travelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Popping it open and locking the various pieces of card in place provides a stand for you to rest your smartphone on and use your phone’s camera to take a picture of old 35mm film and slide transparencies against the backlight built into the stand and powered by its two AA batteries. You can also use the free Kodak Mobile Film Scanner app for more features and editing possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So is Kodak’s Film Scanner cut out to handle your backlog of film and slides or does it land as flat as it packs? I find out…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-kodak-mobile-film-scanner-specifications&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kodak Mobile Film Scanner: Specifications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-kodak-mobile-film-scanner-price&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kodak Mobile Film Scanner: Price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kodak Mobile Film Scanner costs $35 /£37 which feels steep for a product that is made mostly out of cardboard, however I have to keep reminding myself that much of the value in this product comes from the Kodak Mobile Film Scanner app which makes it easy to magnify your slides and film on a larger smartphone screen for easy viewing and you can even invert your negatives to see them clearly too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s by no means the best way to achieve a quality scan, but at less than $40 it&#39;s undoubtedly one of the most affordable. If you&#39;re just looking to flick through slides to do an image cull then you might be better off with a product like the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/cameras/camera-accessories/kodak-35mm-slide-viewer-review&quot;&gt;Kodak 35mm Slide Viewer&lt;/a&gt; which has a much sturdier construction and is a similar price. While if you wish to digitize your film it&#39;d be worth saving up for a product like the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/kodak-slide-n-scan-digital-film-scanner-review&quot;&gt;Kodak Slide N Sca&lt;/a&gt;n ($180/£140) for better quality results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-kodak-mobile-film-scanner-design-handling&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kodak Mobile Film Scanner: Design &amp;amp; Handling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kodak Mobile Film Scanner is remarkably compact, owing to its flatpack-style cardboard design. Speaking of which cardboard is a very lightweight material with the whole device tipping the scales at just 249g and collapsing down to 10.5x15.5x4.2cm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When in use the device pops up to a working height of 10.5x15.5x11cm, though if your smartphone cannot focus within 3.3in you’ll need to also stack up two more cardboard extenders which add an extra 5.5cm to the height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:2000px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;fUQFmAASUn6ybZkrQ88g4&quot; name=&quot;Kodak Mobile_02&quot; alt=&quot;Kodak Mobile Film Scanner&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fUQFmAASUn6ybZkrQ88g4.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2000&quot; height=&quot;1125&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The Kodak Mobile Film Scanner packs down to neat dimensions of 10.5x15.5x4.2cm when not in use &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the pieces of cardboard that make up the main components are a few millimetres deep and feel surprisingly sturdy and are also coated with a satin coating for a premium feel, the extenders are much thinner at around 0.5cm so your phone can feel a little precarious when placed on top of it. The whole cut in the cardboard is also in the centre of the device but the cameras of many smartphones are offset to one side, so to get this to line up does mean it’s a bit unbalanced. I wouldn’t want to use it outdoors and certainly wouldn’t want cardboard getting wet in the rain as this could greatly weaken its strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:2000px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;GPAYAARLnYtXGrywNLvAD&quot; name=&quot;Kodak Mobile_05&quot; alt=&quot;Kodak Mobile Film Scanner&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GPAYAARLnYtXGrywNLvAD.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2000&quot; height=&quot;1125&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The Kodak Mobile Film Scanner is lightweight and compact largely in part to its mostly cardboard construction which folds together origami-style. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base is a full inch thick giving the device a sturdy foundation. This is also where you’ll find the battery access where you can insert two AA’s, though no batteries are included which is dissapointing considering its price. The power switch is also located on the bottom of the base which is a bit annoying as it’s not easy to get to once you’ve got your phone all set up on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backlight is also located here with its plastic surround for loading in your color or negative film as well as slides, though its worth noting that the backlight area is only 35x25mm (the same as a 35mm piece of film) so for larger square format ones in the same 5x5cm surrounds you will only be able to capture the most central part of the frame. The backlight looks to be four small LEDs attached to a sheet of 35mm clear plastic with a diffusion screen to spread the light out evenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:2000px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;HRtKdTdJpeAfZ7BRzWRCB&quot; name=&quot;Kodak Mobile_08&quot; alt=&quot;Kodak Mobile Film Scanner&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HRtKdTdJpeAfZ7BRzWRCB.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2000&quot; height=&quot;1125&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;There&#39;s a diffusion screen on the base with four LEDs providing even light to your film and transparencies &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device is designed to work best with the free Kodak Mobile Film Scanner App which allows users to perform the following actions: Color Negative, Color Positive or Black &amp;amp; White Negative. When scanning you have a simple slider to control the amount of yellow or red is in the image and then once taken you have the option to add a filter, frame, make the border more rounded,adjust the contrast and exposure, vignette, crop, rotate, saturation, sharpness, warmth, pixelate, draw, sticker or add text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-kodak-mobile-film-scanner-performance&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kodak Mobile Film Scanner: Performance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big part of the Kodak Mobile Film Scanner’s performance comes down to the quality of the smartphone used with it, how much resolution it has, how good the lens is, its minimum focusing distance and whether it can shoot RAW or only JPEG. So two users are invariably going to have very different results using the same product – your results may vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To try and give the Kodak Mobile Film Scanner a fair review I tried as many smartphones as I had to hand, including an old Honor mobile with a camera in the centre for better balance, though my newer Android and Apple iPhone Mini 12 both had their cameras offset so it was a little wobblier. The newer phones also had more than just one rear camera which made it difficult for the phones to focus through the small hole, clearly designed for older cameras with just one central back camera and Kodak could really do with updating this design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:2000px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;29QZMnGPaHkR9iaAUcKo7&quot; name=&quot;Kodak Mobile_09&quot; alt=&quot;Kodak Mobile Film Scanner&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/29QZMnGPaHkR9iaAUcKo7.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;2000&quot; height=&quot;1125&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The design feels a bit dated as it caters for smartphones with a central rear camera which hasn&#39;t been the fashion for sometime and many new models usually have multiple lenses which can make it tricky for the phone to focus through the small opening in the cardboard platform &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting the phone to one side and judging the product just on what’s in the box – I do think it’s quite expensive for what you get considering its a basic cardboard construction with some very simple electronics for batteries to power the LED backlight, though there is value in the app which also comes with it and is free to download.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the Kodak Mobile Film Scanner definitely has some utility, though perhaps not for batch scanning. It’s perhaps best used as a slide and film viewer, to go through and quickly cull your images before using your bigger and better scanner, or sending them off to be professionally scanned. It can be quite difficult to see what’s going on in old film photos, especially if they are negatives so enlarging them and inverting them through the app does make this process much easier than using a standard slide viewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-kodak-mobile-film-scanner-verdict&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kodak Mobile Film Scanner: Verdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kodak Mobile Film Scanner could be very useful for somebody culling a large batch of film slides and negatives as it allows you to not only see what’s on the film much larger via your smartphone screen but is also very handy at inverting your B&amp;amp;W and color negatives so you can see what’s going on – something not possible with a conventional slide viewer. But as for actually creating high quality scans of your film using a smartphone – not so much. There’s too much difference between phone models, lenses and sensor resolution to give a definitive answer and your mileage may vary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got kids or grandchildren that are interested in film this could be a fun and novel present for them and the app is very user friendly and has lots of features, but it’s far from the most ideal setup for creating high quality scans – your phone is often too far away from the film and requires a big crop so it’s difficult to capture all of the brilliant detail in 35mm film. Plus the design is tailored to older smartphones with a central back camera and this doesn&#39;t work very well with the latest phones which have multiple cameras and are offset from the centre too.&lt;/p&gt;

The control panel is rather different but again relies exclusively on pushbuttons, as the larger LCD still isn’t a touchscreen. Even so, operation is simple and effective, and scanning speed is quick, although the actual image quality isn’t overly impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I get SELLER&#39;S remorse from getting rid of cameras I wish I&#39;d kept!</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Buyer’s remorse is that feeling you get when you splash out on a new purchase and then suddenly get the feeling it’s not as good as you thought –&amp;nbsp;or that you’ve spent too much money on something that, now you’ve got it, you’re no longer itching to own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I get that. But what I get is &lt;em&gt;seller&#39;s&lt;/em&gt; remorse, with the associated gear re-buying syndrome. I sell some gear, wish I hadn’t, and very often buy it again. I have kind of got that under control now, but it has been a serious problem, especially with my &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-micro-four-thirds-camera&quot;&gt;Micro Four Thirds cameras&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, I’ve sold and re-bought the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/olympus-pen-e-p7-review&quot;&gt;Olympus PEN E-P7&lt;/a&gt; –&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt;. Logically, I managed to convince myself I had far better cameras in my drawer that I could and should be shooting with, so I sold it (them). But when it came down to it, I realized this was the one everyday carry I couldn’t do without. Oh, and they do look wonderful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:4608px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;ofy4mf8sdzhZ6uX94vbonW&quot; name=&quot;PA160001.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark III&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ofy4mf8sdzhZ6uX94vbonW.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;4608&quot; height=&quot;2592&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;I sold my Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark III – then rebought it, as I missed it so much &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Rod Lawton/Digital Camera World)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there were my two &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/olympus-om-d-e-m5-mark-iii-review&quot;&gt;Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark IIIs&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, two. I sold the first one because I had an &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/olympus-om-d-e-m1-mark-iii-review&quot;&gt;E-M1 Mark III&lt;/a&gt;, which was logically better in every respect, then re-bought a used E-M5 Mark III because I missed it so much.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m also on my second &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/olympus-mzuiko-45mm-f18-review&quot;&gt;Olympus M.Zuiko 45mm f/1.8&lt;/a&gt;. I sold the first because I thought a fast MFT portrait lens was a pretty lame concept, then had to re-buy it because I realized there was nothing else like it. I know, most people buy on impulse; I &lt;em&gt;sell&lt;/em&gt; on impulse, and I think that’s worse. Maybe I need help with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:2560px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;8PzPuUngnKM9x3jLGBRMPL&quot; name=&quot;Nikon-D610-d1295-045.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Nikon D610&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8PzPuUngnKM9x3jLGBRMPL.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;2560&quot; height=&quot;1442&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;When I sold my Nikon D7200 because it was &#39;obsolete&#39; (I thought) I missed the DSLR experience so much I had to get a used D610 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Rod Lawton)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other items I’ve sold that I should have kept include my &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/nikon-d7200-deals&quot;&gt;Nikon D7200&lt;/a&gt; DSLR. I sold it because I had newer, better mirrorless cameras and thought it was a bit of a relic… then missed the DSLR experience so much that I bought a used Nikon D610, which I now use all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the D7200 went, the 18-105mm kit lens went with it – still one of the best long-range kit lenses ever, IMHO – and my Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8 constant aperture zoom. What an amazing lens! (I realize now.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also regret selling my &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/canon-eos-rp-review&quot;&gt;Canon EOS RP&lt;/a&gt;. I have an&lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/canon-eos-r8-review&quot;&gt; EOS R8&lt;/a&gt;, which is a much better camera in every respect, but it&#39;s just as fiddly and plasticky. I kind of feel that the EOS RP was more likable because it actually &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; cheap and honest about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what was I thinking when I got rid of my &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/sony-a7r-ii-review&quot;&gt;Sony A7R II&lt;/a&gt;? Yes, it was a boring camera with sluggish responses and lamentable battery life, but where will I ever get that kind of resolution again at the price I paid? (Around £1,200, towards the end of its retail life.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m also worried that I sold my &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/news/i-bought-an-x-t5-and-now-my-lenses-arent-good-enough-its-actually-that-serious&quot;&gt;Fujifilm X-T5&lt;/a&gt;. I was never happy that the X-mount lenses available &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/news/i-bought-an-x-t5-and-now-my-lenses-arent-good-enough-its-actually-that-serious&quot;&gt;didn’t seem to match the potential&lt;/a&gt; of the sensor, but I’m worried how long it will be before that itch starts again…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, buyer&#39;s remorse? Don’t worry about it. With buyer&#39;s remorse, you buy in haste and then repent after careful consideration. With seller&#39;s remorse, it&#39;s the other way round –&amp;nbsp;and believe me, it&#39;s worse!&lt;/p&gt;

Both compact cameras and the retro style seem on the rise, which makes it unsurprising that the X100VI is so popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are alternatives to the hard-to-find camera. Pairing the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/cameras/lenses/the-fujifilm-xf-27mm-f-2-8-r-wr-doesnt-get-enough-credit-as-a-hack-to-diy-an-x100vi&quot;&gt;Fujifilm XF 27mm f/2.8 R WR with a Fujifilm mirrorless body&lt;/a&gt; will also make a relatively compact shooter. High-end compacts like the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/leica-d-lux-8-review&quot;&gt;Leica D-LUX 8&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/ricoh-gr-iii-review&quot;&gt;Ricoh GR III&lt;/a&gt; are another option.&lt;/p&gt;

They &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; access the internet, and may even be able to run specific apps like Facebook… but their online use is very limited. They&#39;re primarily designed for making phone calls and sending texts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nokia 110 4G is one of the cheapest around, offering a modern take on the classic feature phone at a very affordable price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a company, Nokia sold off its phone division years ago. HMD Global has continued to make Nokia-branded phones, though, and the 110 4G is one of many on the market today. It serves several distinct audiences: digital minimalists attempting to reduce screen time, elderly users who prefer physical buttons to touchscreens, and those wanting a cheap backup phone. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After spending a few weeks with the Nokia 110 4G, I&#39;ve got a clear understanding of its strengths and limitations. Read on to find out what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-nokia-110-4g-specifications&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nokia 110 4G: Specifications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:4000px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;z5GCwNYF6CcHus32HM7cnK&quot; name=&quot;20250319_174932.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nokia 110 4G on desk&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z5GCwNYF6CcHus32HM7cnK.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;4000&quot; height=&quot;2250&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-nokia-110-4g-pricing-and-availability&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nokia 110 4G: Pricing and availability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nokia 110 4G retails for approximately $40 USD / £30 GB / AU$60, making it very cheap, even compared with other feature phones. At the same time, the price feels appropriate given its limited capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-nokia-110-4g-build-and-handling&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nokia 110 4G: Build and handling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small and basic phone immediately impressed me with its solid construction and rectangular design, which is quite distinctively retro. It&#39;s very small (121.5 x 50 x 14.4mm) and very light (94.5g), making it hugely portable and able to fit into the slimmest of pockets. This phone felt good in the hand. The textured plastic back provides excellent grip, and while plasticky, its overall design feels sturdy enough to withstand daily wear and tear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be frank, I wasn&#39;t so keen on the tiny 1.8-inch screen, which is significantly less nice to use than the 2.8-inch screens of the Nokia 225 4G and Nokia 3310. Then again, if you&#39;re digital detoxing and want to spend less time staring at a screen, perhaps the smaller and nastier, the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found the physical keypad well-designed, with decent sized, nicely spaced buttons offering satisfying tactile feedback. The T9 predictive text input works efficiently, and the navigation experience felt intuitive. The direction pad is responsive, and the menu system is straightforward to navigate. Like most feature phones, though, the buttons are quite small and fiddly, so I wouldn&#39;t recommend this handset for a frail and elderly family member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s also a charging port (micro USB) on the bottom, and a 3.5mm headphone jack on the top, both of which did their jobs well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-nokia-110-4g-performance&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nokia 110 4G: Performance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real-world usage, I found voices calls to be very good quality, with clear audio and good volume levels. The HD voice support makes a noticeable difference on compatible networks, and the speaker is surprisingly loud and clear for such a small, cheap device.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is typical for a feature phone, I found battery life to be exceptional, easily lasting three to four days with regular use for calls and texts. With minimal usage, it stretched to nearly a week between charges; a refreshing change from modern smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 4G connectivity allowed for basic tasks like sending MMS messages and light web browsing. Text messaging works reliably, though the lack of conversation threading (organising messages by contact) feels outdated. The Opera Mini browser handles simple websites, but complex modern sites can be very challenging to navigate on the small screen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:4000px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;jjd6YokgmU7CVezuK6hgSL&quot; name=&quot;20250319_175136.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nokia 110 4G on desk with back cover and battery removed&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jjd6YokgmU7CVezuK6hgSL.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;4000&quot; height=&quot;2250&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, though, more involved stuff like streaming video on YouTube, ordering stuff on Uber or Just Eat, using GPS, or even scanning a QR code, isn&#39;t possible on this device. Another limitation is the absence of Wi-Fi hotspot functionality, which would have been useful for occasional tethering to other devices. Again, though, if you want a dumbphone in order to digitally detox, you&#39;ll consider these restrictions a bug, not a feature.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing you can do is listen to music, in a couple of ways. The included FM radio functions well, with the ability to work without headphones connected (though reception improves with them). The MP3 player is basic but functional, supporting playback from microSD storage. Note, though, that there are no physical volume controls, so you have to do that within the interface, which I found fiddly and awkward.&amp;nbsp; You also get a lot of little in-built apps including a voice recorder, some simple games, including Snake, a calculator, a calendar and a small torch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-nokia-110-4g-photography&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nokia 110 4G: Photography&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera on this phone is extremely limited. It doesn&#39;t offer video, and with stills, the picture quality is as poor as you&#39;d expect from a 0.3MP sensor. It&#39;s even bad for a cheap feature phone. The shots I captured were noticeably smaller and grubbier than those of the Nokia 225 4G and &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tech/phones/nokia-6310-review-relive-the-early-2000s-with-this-nostalgic-feature-phone&quot;&gt;Nokia 6310&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:320px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;kCDbsNbjWL6EKptuigiPdV&quot; name=&quot;110-4g-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Low-res photo of a statue of an English church under a blue sky&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kCDbsNbjWL6EKptuigiPdV.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;but most of the time, your images just look like they&#39;ve been corrupted &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those cameras aren&#39;t great either, but they are a tiny bit better so you can at least use them for reference photos. With the Nokia 110 4G, though, photos I took of text such as the one below were unreadable. Also, unlike said rivals, this phone doesn&#39;t let you shoot video at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:320px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;jJGTBufGc2tjBgmbDoNufV&quot; name=&quot;110-4g-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Low-res photo of a statue of a bus timetable&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jJGTBufGc2tjBgmbDoNufV.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Photographing text is pointless: when you zoom in, you just get a blurry, unreadable mess  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I hadn&#39;t really anticipated was how difficult it is to share pictures I&#39;d taken with other people. That&#39;s something that didn&#39;t really bother me when I used a dumbphone back in the late 90s, but nowadays it&#39;s something we&#39;re so used to doing on our smartphones, it really hurts. Then again, the pictures are so bad, then you probably won&#39;t want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nokia 110 4G succeeds admirably at its core purpose: providing reliable voice and text messaging in a simple, durable and light phone... all at a very low price. For those seeking a digital detox, or anyone wanting a dependable backup phone, it offers excellent value.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just don&#39;t expect anything more, and especially don&#39;t expect the camera to take usable photos.&amp;nbsp;For a little more money, you can get a &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tech/phones/nokia-225-4g-review-a-retro-mobile-phone-at-a-super-low-price&quot;&gt;Nokia 225 4G&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tech/phones/nokia-6310-review-relive-the-early-2000s-with-this-nostalgic-feature-phone&quot;&gt;Nokia 6310&lt;/a&gt;, both of which offer slightly nicer screens, slightly better photos and the ability to shoot low-res video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its inception in 1955, the World Press Photo Foundation has championed impactful journalism, ensuring that vital global stories are seen and heard through breathtaking imagery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are thrilled to bring this remarkable exhibition back to London for a second consecutive year,&quot; said the London exhibition director, Woody Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;After a 7-year absence from the country, its successful reintroduction in 2024 reaffirmed its status as a must-see cultural event. We are excited to continue building its legacy as an essential highlight in the UK’s cultural calendar.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running from May 23 to August 25 2025, the exhibition will take visitors on an unforgettable journey through the lenses of the world’s leading photographers. It will be held at Here East, on the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, coinciding with the highly anticipated opening of the V&amp;amp;A Storehouse on the same campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;East London has cemented its reputation as a thriving hub for culture and creativity, attracting world-class institutions and artists,&quot; said Mike Magan, COO of Here East, emphasizing the significance of this moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;With the V&amp;amp;A Storehouse opening at Here East this spring, the launch of the innovative dance venue Sadler’s Wells East, the soon-to-arrive BBC Music Studios, and now the return of the World Press Photo Exhibition, this corner of London is setting the pace for the future of the creative industries - and we’re proud to be at the heart of it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibition’s return has generated excitement within the photography community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s an honor to support the World Press Photo Exhibition,&quot; shared Sophie Collins, CMO of MPB, a key supporter of the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Each year, this showcase provides an unparalleled window into global events through the eyes of the world’s most talented photographers.

As a Fujifilm photographer, I get the appeal of a retro-styled camera with film simulations that is small enough to take anywhere. But as gorgeous as the X100VI is, I would buy the Fujifilm XF 27mm f/2.8 R WR and pair it with a mirrorless camera before I caved to the X100VI trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/fujinon-xf27mmf28-r-wr-review&quot;&gt;Fujifilm XF 27mm f/2.8 R WR&lt;/a&gt; is arguably the closest lens in Fujifilm’s mirrorless line-up to the built-in lens on the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/fujifilm-x100vi-review-dont-mess-with-a-winner&quot;&gt;X100VI&lt;/a&gt;. The compact camera has a 23mm f/2 lens built-in, so Fujifilm’s pancake lens gets in slightly closer and isn’t quite as bright. Despite that, the tiny 27mm lens only adds around .9 inches / 23mm and 3 oz / 84g to a mirrorless camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paired with a camera like the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/fujifilm-x-t50-review&quot;&gt;X-T50&lt;/a&gt;, the 27mm creates a very X100VI-like set-up, and for slightly more than the X100VI’s list price but less than what scalpers are still charging for the hard-to-find camera. The X-T50 has the same 40.2MP resolution as the X100VI, and with the lens, the total kit would weigh 19 oz / 522g. That’s only a gram more than the X100VI. The depth of the X-T50 with the 27mm would come in at roughly 2.82 in / 71.8mm, which is only around half an inch or 16.5mm deeper than the X100VI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The X-50 isn’t weather-sealed, however, so photographers looking for something that would be arguably more durable than the X100VI could &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/fujifilm-x-t50-vs-x-t5&quot;&gt;compare it to the X-T5&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/fujifilm-x-t5-review&quot;&gt;X-T5&lt;/a&gt; with the 27mm f/2.8 would up the build quality, but also increase the size and price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s if you want a camera with the same 40.2MP resolution as the X100VI. Photographers who don’t need quite so much detail could even hack a cheaper, smaller mirrorless combo by pairing the older &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/fujifilm-x-t30-ii-review&quot;&gt;X-T30 II&lt;/a&gt; with the XF 27mm f/2.8 R WR for a few hundred less than the X100VI. The &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/fujifilm-x-m5-review&quot;&gt;X-M5&lt;/a&gt; would also make an affordable and compact combo with the XF 27mm f/2.8. (Although, sadly, &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/cameras/mirrorless-cameras/fujifilm-x-m5-price-about-to-fall-victim-to-the-same-hikes-as-the-fujifilm-x100vi&quot;&gt;the X-M5 is currently out of stock at many retailers&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;My point is this: Yes, &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-compact-camera&quot;&gt;compact cameras&lt;/a&gt; have an incredible advantage because you can take them almost anywhere. But, &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/news/stop-overpaying-for-trendy-compact-cameras-this-is-what-you-should-buy-instead&quot;&gt;a compact &lt;em&gt;mirrorless kit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t come with long wait times, isn’t much bigger, and allows for far greater versatility. If you grow out of that tiny pancake lens, you can &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/news/fujinon-xf56mmf12-r-wr-fujifilms-portrait-bokeh-master-lens-gets-makeover&quot;&gt;add a portrait lens&lt;/a&gt; later on, an &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-lenses-for-landscapes&quot;&gt;even wider optic for landscapes&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-fujifilm-lenses&quot;&gt;a telephoto zoom for wildlife&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love Fujifilm cameras, but I would personally pick up the Fujifilm XF 27mm f/2.8 R WR and pair it with the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/fujifilm-x-t4-review&quot;&gt;X-T4&lt;/a&gt; already in my camera bag before I bought the X100VI. It’s far cheaper than the X100VI considering I already have a good, albeit now aging retro-styled body. But, even for those without an existing kit, pairing a pancake lens with a mirrorless camera can be a more versatile combo without a major price difference.&lt;/p&gt;

Thankfully it&#39;s got a decent video spec, with 6K 30p and 4K 60p capture. It also comes with a variety of LUT presets to instantly enhance the look of video footage.

Is Nikon getting ready for the Z5 II?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Nikon Z5 opened up the Z line with a more affordable, smaller full-frame model but, nearly five years since the camera launched, the Z5 has become far more affordable. Older cameras tend to see steeper and more frequent discounts and nearly five years after the launch, the Z5 is almost as cheap as the crop sensor Z50 II. Those discounts and the impending fifth birthday raise a key question: is Nikon getting ready to launch the Z5 II anytime soon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While five years seems like the perfect timing to launch a successor, the Nikon Z5 is a budget camera that has gotten better over the last five years. Why? Because as the Z5 has aged, the price has dropped. The Z5’s original list price wasn’t too far from the Z6 series, which is now on the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/nikon-z6-iii-review-a-dream-camera-for-content-creators-through-to-enthusiast-and-pro-photographers&quot;&gt;Z6 III&lt;/a&gt;, but axed several features. Back in 2020, the Nikon Z6 felt like the far better value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now that the Z5 is getting on in years, it’s possible to pick the camera up for under $1,000 / £900, which is less than half the price of the newly launched Z6 III. The full-frame Z5 &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/cameras/mirrorless-cameras/the-compact-nikon-z5-is-now-almost-as-cheap-as-the-z50-ii-is-a-new-nikon-z5-ii-imminent&quot;&gt;isn’t much more than the Z50 II right now&lt;/a&gt;, which has a smaller crop sensor. That makes the camera a far easier decision for photographers who are truly looking for a more affordable budget camera compared to when the Z5 sat at its $1,400 / £1,249 / AU$2,599.95 list price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the price of the Z5 that we originally complained about in our &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/nikon-z5-review&quot;&gt;Z5 review&lt;/a&gt; has been – at least with temporary sales – fixed, the entry-level mirrorless camera is starting to show its age a bit. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the Nikon Z5 II this year or the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, with an entry-level budget model, what is Nikon most likely to change on the successor? The resolution is out – the Z6 III has the same 24.5MP as the Z5, so I wouldn’t expect the lower-tier camera to see any improvement in resolution when the higher-priced model did not. I speculate that Nikon will reserve the partially stacked design of the Z6 III for the higher-priced camera as well, but then again, sometimes it is more affordable to manufacture all the same sensors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suspect the biggest improvement could be moving from the EXPEED 6 to the newer EXPEED 7 processor. Even the Z50 II has the EXPEED 7, so Nikon isn’t afraid to put the processor in a more affordable camera. That should give the camera a boost in speed, which would be welcomed as the Z5’s 4.5fps bursts are quite slow by today’s standards. If the sensor isn&#39;t stacked, then the update to the newer processor would push the Z5 II speed closer to the Z6 III while keeping some separation between the two tiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing I think Nikon needs to continue to prioritize in the Z5 series is size. The Z5 isn’t just Nikon’s most affordable full-frame mirrorless, but, at the time when it launched, was the most compact of Nikon’s FX cameras with its kit lens. That, of course, was before Nikon introduced the Nikon Zf, which is both compact and retro-styled. But the Z5 and the Zf remain a ways apart yet in price and speed, with the Z5 sitting at the more entry-level spot for both price and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The age and price of the Nikon Z5 make me think that a successor could be coming – and the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/news/camera-rumors/2&quot;&gt;latest Nikon rumors&lt;/a&gt; hint towards an impending launch as well. Rumors and speculation are all that exist for now, however, so Nikon fans will have to wait for an official announcement to see what Nikon has in store for the entry-level full-frame model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the GFX 100RF is the proven 102MP 43.8 x 32.9mm BSI CMOS sensor from the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/fujifilm-gfx-100s-ii-review&quot;&gt;Fujifilm GFX 100S II&lt;/a&gt;, which produces stunning 16-bit raw files, 10-bit HEIFs, and a wide dynamic range with low noise, thanks to a base ISO of 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This high-resolution sensor allows for remarkable cropping flexibility across nine distinct aspect ratios. Powered by Fujifilm&#39;s advanced X Processor 5, the camera offers fast performance, supporting continuous shooting at up to 6fps, 4K video recording, and an Intelligent Hybrid AF system for precise autofocus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhancing creative possibilities, the GFX 100RF includes a dedicated aspect ratio dial on the back of the camera and a lever beneath the shutter button to control Digital Teleconverter settings. The aspect ratio dial allows users to seamlessly switch between 9 different options: 4:3, 3:4, 5:4, 1:1, 3:2, 7:6, 65:24, 17:6, and 16:9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these formats pay homage to Fujifilm’s legacy medium format film cameras, including the GX680’s native 4:3, the panoramic TX-1’s 65:24, and the GA645 series’ vertical 3:4 ratio. When shooting in JPEG + RAW or JPEG-only modes, the selected aspect ratio is displayed in both the EVF and rear LCD, though RAW-only shooting does not retain the crop information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A defining feature of the GFX 100RF is its built-in GF 35mm f/4 wide-angle prime lens, transforming it into an intuitive, always-ready point-and-shoot camera while maintaining the exceptional image quality expected from medium format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an equivalent focal length of 28mm on full-frame cameras, the lens offers a versatile wide-angle perspective, perfect for street, documentary, landscape, and travel photography. A minimum focusing distance of 7.8 inches also allows for close-up shooting, and the f/4 maximum aperture ensures effective low-light performance while keeping the camera’s size and weight manageable for everyday carry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;True to Fujifilm&#39;s heritage, the GFX 100RF features the brand’s complete lineup of 20 Film Simulation modes. These include classics like Provia, Velvia, and Astia, alongside nostalgic options like Classic Chrome, Reala Ace, Classic Neg, and Nostalgic Neg Black &amp;amp; White variations, Acros, Eterna Cinema, and Sepia further expand the creative palette, offering a range of tonal and color aesthetics straight out of the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

Its MediaTek Dimensity 8400 Ultra processor is just a couple of notches below flagship-grade when it comes to gaming; it has a zingy, smooth 6.67-inch AMOLED screen, and the huge 6,000mAh battery that bests many top-tier alternatives. Going beyond spec, in vegan leather, it looks standout with its yellow and black finish, and it’s also durable with IP68 water resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One area Poco phones haven’t typically shone is camera performance. However, the X6 Pro is a step in the right direction in a couple of areas. First, it ditches the terrible 2MP macro cameras that weighed down the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tech/android-phones/redmi-note-14-pro-and-pro-plus-review&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Redmi Note 14 Pro series&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Next, the primary camera looks like a solid 50MP module with OIS, suggesting this phone could actually check more than just gaming boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of competition for the Poco X7 Pro, including last year’s excellent X6 Pro, the Redmi Note 14 Pro, and the slick Nothing Phone (3a), not to mention Honor’s battery-tastic Magic 7 Lite. Out of the gate, if you want power, the Poco X7 Pro beats out the competition, but is it our winner across the board?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Poco X7 Pro is available in white, green, or a more standout yellow and black, which sets two textures of vegan leather against one another, looking eye-catching in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with most 2025 phones, the X7 Pro has a flat front and back, matched with a matte plastic frame that makes for a comfortable grip. The phone measures 8.3 mm thin and weighs 195 grams, so it strikes a balance between feeling solid and relatively lightweight. Impressive for the price, the X7 Pro is IP68 rated for dust and water resistance, and the phone has a pre-fitted screen protector, plus an opaque black case in the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The X7 Pro’s 6.67-inch AMOLED display looks great, with a resolution of 2170 x 1220 pixels, making it nice and sharp. Gliding at up to 120Hz, the screen is smooth when scrolling and responsive when gaming, making the whole experience feel more premium than the X7 Pro’s price suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a peak brightness of up to 3200 nits when displaying HDR content, HDR and HD Netflix certification, and strong outdoor visibility in direct sunlight, visuals shine indoors and out, whether swiping through the UI or watching and gaming, and the phone also has a relatively hardy Gorilla Glass 7i display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Poco X7 Pro is also available in a special Iron Man Edition in select regions, widely sold out but available if you shop around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s without a doubt one of the best brand partnerships we&#39;ve come across, with the striking design echoing Iron Man’s armor and breastplate, complete with a red and gold color scheme and an almost trading card aesthetic around the back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The special edition X7 Pro comes in a collector&#39;s gift box that includes themed accessories, a custom USB cable, and an armor-like protective case. The UI is also customized with Iron Man-themed wallpapers, icons, and startup animations, and the phone packs the X7 Pro’s maxed-out spec of 512GB storage and 12GB RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Poco X7 Pro has two cameras around the back – a wide and ultra-wide – and a punch-hole selfie camera on the front. The wide camera is the best-specced, while the ultra-wide and selfie cameras lack autofocus.&lt;/p&gt;

While there’s a Pro mode for manual shooting, none of the Poco X7 Pro’s cameras capture RAW photos natively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Poco X7 Pro camera is good, not great. Poco phones tend to ramp up vibrancy and the X7 Pro is no exception. Blues in the sky are seriously amped, and grass takes on a warmth and zing that looks lively but less realistic than pricier competition, but despite this very enthusiastic processing, detail from the main camera and performance in most conditions is respectable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its price range, all smartphone cameras have notable strengths and weaknesses, and the Poco X7 Pro&#39;s most marked quirk is how much better its main camera is than the ultra-wide camera. In most situations, if you can give the main camera a steady hand, it will capture a good-looking shot, whether outdoors in the day or night, or indoors in middling lighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultra-wide struggles in most environments, with low detail and muddy results, worsened as the lights dropped. Color consistency across the wide and ultra-wide are also off at times, so we would urge any X7 Pro owners to only lean on the ultra-wide in great lighting or at night when you can get the phone on a surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the camera samples, the high-resolution main camera with its relatively large sensor, can take a great-looking shot. Close-up subjects create a sense of depth with subtle background blur, and the in-sensor zoom does a good job up to 4x, which is good going at the Poco X7 Pro&#39;s price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic range is also relatively strong from the main camera (and weak from the ultra-wide), and there&#39;s also enough contrast to avoid an excessive HDR look in most scenes. Poco applies a significant amount of sharpening, especially to in-sensor zoom shots captured in middling light, and having tested the Poco X7 Pro alongside the Samsung Galaxy A56 5G, it&#39;s hard not to draw comparisons between Samsung&#39;s traditionally punchy, slightly blunt photo processing and Poco&#39;s in the X7 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video shot on the X7 Pro&#39;s main camera looks good in bright environments, and hand shake is kept at bay with OIS and EIS kicking in. Avoid switching to the ultra-wide in anything but ideal lighting; not only will the resolution drop, but noise is handled badly, so you&#39;re better off sticking to the primary camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Selfie video does a good job of prioritizing a face while clinging onto a respectable amount of dynamic range. However, as with photos and rear camera videos, vibrancy being so ramped up can leave footage looking a bit too zingy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, if you&#39;re a casual photo and video taker, the Poco X7 Pro&#39;s primary and selfie cameras are good options. Still, for more discerning users who want to take photos in Lightroom and edit videos, Poco&#39;s processing takes things a step too far to pare back easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-poco-x7-pro-review-performance-and-battery&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Poco X7 Pro review: performance and battery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance is where the Poco X7 Pro shines. Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 8400 Ultra chipset and paired with either 8GB or 12GB RAM, the X7 Pro is the best option on the market for gamers on a budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With either 256GB or 512GB RAM, the X7 Pro packs plenty of space for huge titles like Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves – roughly 50GB between them both – and it also plays them back very well, even at higher graphics settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main drawback of a Poco phone is the busy, bloated interface. Xiaomi&#39;s HyperOS gets an injection of bloatware to help lower the positioning of Poco and Redmi phones, so while the core functionality is competitive, you&#39;ll have to spend some time uninstalling apps and setting the phone up just the way you want it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The X7 Pro&#39;s large 6,000mAh battery lasts a couple of days with standard use and a full day even with significant gaming, photo taking, and watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-poco-x7-pro-verdict&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Poco X7 Pro verdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Poco X7 Pro is probably the best gaming phone at its price and a good enough camera phone for most. Discerning photographers, i.e. anyone who wants RAW capture, reliable results across cameras, and more subdued processing should look elsewhere, but if you don&#39;t mind vibrant shots, you can still lean on the primary camera with some confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Poco included RAW capture and Log video (i.e., ways to bypass the aggressive processing), that could have taken the X7 Pro&#39;s appeal a little further for imaging enthusiasts; however, the phone still has plenty going for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The star of the X7 Pro show is the Dimensity 8400 Ultra processor, with the 120Hz AMOLED display,  standout styling, and large 6000mAh battery not far behind. With IP68 water and dust resistance, plenty of storage, and fast charging, despite not being one of the best budget camera phones of 2025, the X7 Pro is still one of the best budget smartphones, especially for gamers.&lt;/p&gt;

At any angle?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Obsbot&#39;s new studio-ready PTZ camera the Tail 2 is stacked brings the company&#39;s popular AI tracking tech into a 4K broadcast-capable environment, and goes further than before. It could mean that camera operators become entirely optional – even for the main camera. Atop all that it has another trick up its sleeve – rotation!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Tail 2 is stacked with the features you&#39;d expect from any serious PTZ camera – NDI, RTMP, HDMI etc, – but Obsbot can call it a &quot;World&#39;s First PTZR&quot; (The R is for rotation, because Obsbot&#39;s gimbal is capable of working vertically).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Obsbot&#39;s impressive webcam-sized gimbal cameras with tracking, like the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/obsbot-tiny-2-review&quot;&gt;Tiny 2 which nearly knocked my socks off in review&lt;/a&gt;, this device boasts straightforward AI subject tracking, but on every level the specs are bumped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new AI Tracking 2.0 system can still follow simple hand gestures from subjects, or remote control on app or a remote device like the Obsbot Talent. The AI can recognise over 30 animals and over 200 objects, and track zonally, frame specific things like faces and keep a group in frame at once like the dancers illustrated. If the person speaking turns to look at another the camera will frame them both automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The camera boasts all-pixel phase detection AF on its 1/1.5-inch image sensor, which Obsbot say makes it fast enough to keep up with fast-moving sports like tennis. The chip also boasts dual native ISO, meaning low light should prove less of a challenge than with other camera systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 12-element lens means that, up to 5x zoom, all zoom falls onto 2 nano-meter pixels, though there is the option of hybrid up to 12x zoom too, and this appears smooth and continuous from Obsbot&#39;s demos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as high-end broadcast compatibility with integrated NDI HX3, the camera is equipped with the FreeD protocol which means it&#39;s able to fit seamlessly into 3D production environments and mo-cap, and Obsbot promise the built-in image stabilization system will benefit creators from virtual studios to games designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connectivity is at a professional level too. The 4K 60fps capable camera boasts a HDMI 2.0 port, Ethernet, 3G-SDI, Ethernet/PoE, USB 3, Mic, Line, RS-232 in and out and a Micro SD Slot for storage. Power, too, is via a USB-C-shaped socket for convenience on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The camera can operate from a 5000mAh battery to provide up to 5 hours of shooting and live-streaming using Wi-Fi 6 at up to 1200Mbps (the more common Wi-Fi 5 is 867 Mbps).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I look forward to confirming whether the camera lives up to the expectations these specs set when my review model arrives soon. The &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.obsbot.com/store/products/obsbot-tail-2?srsltid=AfmBOornXNh2B_uCmplJsj7d-Ob-u_AF8-YHR1coBMpmAST8H6YV3HCq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Obsbot Tail 2&lt;/a&gt; comes in at $1,199 / £999 / AU$1,985 (a cheaper alternative that still has NDI capability exists in the earlier Tail Air which is more targeted at streaming).&lt;/p&gt;

In many ways, it couldn’t be farther from the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-compact-camera&quot;&gt;best compact cameras&lt;/a&gt;. So why do I think compact camera buyers should consider this SLR-style hunk of retro goodness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/nikon-zf-review&quot;&gt;Nikon Zf&lt;/a&gt; is absolutely &lt;em&gt;gorgeous&lt;/em&gt;. When it comes to retro styling, only the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/fujifilm-x-pro3-review&quot;&gt;Fujifilm X-Pro3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/cameras/mirrorless-cameras/om-system-om-3-review&quot;&gt;OM System OM-3&lt;/a&gt; can hold a candle to the Zf. It’s a beautifully faithful recreation of the legendary &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/cameras/film-cameras/i-love-the-nikon-fm2-it-was-only-discontinued-in-2001-and-that-should-tell-you-everything-you-need-to-know&quot;&gt;Nikon FM2&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-film-cameras&quot;&gt;best film cameras&lt;/a&gt; of all time. And because of that, it’s &lt;em&gt;irresistible&lt;/em&gt;. Just like a good compact camera, it begs to be picked up and used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check out &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/nikon-zf-review&quot;&gt;my colleague Gareth&#39;s review&lt;/a&gt; to access all the specs, but the 24.5-MP Nikon Zf is a very capable camera indeed. And it’s a full-frame Nikon, which means gorgeous, nigh-on unbeatable RAW files. But perhaps equally important when it comes to the compact camera market is its ultra-stylish looks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s face it, compact cameras are en vogue because they look darn cool. Well, if you’re looking for a camera to boost your street cred, the Nikon Zf will do just that. And it’s customizable, too. Add a rope strap to ooze retro chic, the shutter button can accommodate a soft shutter release button, and – trust me – a leatherette half case will look &lt;em&gt;the business&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is the Nikon Zf’s form factor. Sure, it’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a compact camera. Even the chunky &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/fujifilm-x100vi-review-dont-mess-with-a-winner&quot;&gt;Fujifilm X100VI&lt;/a&gt; is a lot smaller, but the Nikon Zf’s slim profile still makes it more adept at slipping into a bag than the hefty grips found on most mirrorless cameras. But here’s the thing: I think the Nikon Zf comes into its own when paired with a small, prime lens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The special edition versions of the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/nikon-z-40mm-f2-review&quot;&gt;Nikon Z 40mm f/2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/nikon-z-28mm-f28-se-review&quot;&gt;Nikon Z 28mm f/2.8&lt;/a&gt; are ideal. The faithful SLR style means this camera isn’t really suited to larger lenses unless you buy an aftermarket grip. But a Nikon Zf isn’t designed to be lugged around Yellowstone National Park on a landscape shoot, or paired with the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-telephoto-lens&quot;&gt;best telephoto lenses&lt;/a&gt; on a wildlife shoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nikon Zf is an everyday companion. It’s the camera you take on a coffee date. It’s the camera slung around your neck on a city break. And it’s the camera you spend so much time with, you start to think of it as an old friend. Now, I don’t know about you. But all of that can be applied to compact cameras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nikon Zf. It’s not a compact camera by name or form factor, but perhaps it&#39;s a compact camera in nature…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The X-T5 is a remarkable camera that will fit into anyone&#39;s flow, but don&#39;t take just my word for it, here is what our Managing Editor at the time of its release thought about the Fujifilm X-T5:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The Fujifilm X-T5 is an evolution of the X-T series, rather than a revolution. It&#39;s a classically controlled SLR-style camera that puts photography first for serious enthusiasts. The X-T5 takes the much-loved Fujifilm X-T4 further in terms of resolution but is still ideal for shooters who want a lightweight camera with traditional controls – and an excellent 40.2MP resolution, 10-bit 4:2:2 video at 6.2K/30P and a new 3-way tilting touchscreen. In terms of the way that it looks, feels, and handles, the X-T5 is in a class of its own.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The resulting image is a black-and-white photograph of Porthcawl Lighthouse, South Wales, surrounded by crashing waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edyta told me: &quot;I wanted to capture the raw power of nature and the resilience of the structures built to withstand such forces. The sheer size of the waves, and the way they engulfed the lighthouse, made for an incredible scene that I knew had to be photographed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s worth noting that safety should be your number one priority when photographing in storms, especially on the coast. Be sure to heed any warnings, check tide times before traveling, and always ensure you have a safe exit route. Using one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-telephoto-lens&quot;&gt;best telephoto lenses&lt;/a&gt;, will allow you to stand back and shoot from a safe distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But inclement weather comes with plenty of challenges. Edyta says: &quot;The wind was ferocious and the sea spray was relentless, making it difficult to keep my lens clean. The unpredictable movement of the waves also meant I had to anticipate the perfect moment to capture the lighthouse being overwhelmed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The photographer used &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/adobe-lightroom-classic-review&quot;&gt;Adobe Lightroom Classic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/adobe-photoshop-cc-review&quot;&gt;Adobe Photoshop&lt;/a&gt; to edit the image. &quot;The main adjustments included enhancing contrast and detail to bring out the textures in the waves,&quot; she says, &quot;as well as fine-tuning the exposure to balance the highlights and shadows.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The unpredictable movement of the waves also meant I had to anticipate the perfect moment to capture the lighthouse being overwhelmed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked if she would do anything differently, next time. Edyta tells me: &quot;I would experiment with a slightly longer focal length to compress the scene and emphasize the sheer scale of the waves against the lighthouse.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edyta&#39;s top tips for stormy seascape photography &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edyta tells me she used a fast shutter speed: &quot;To freeze the motion of the waves and capture the dramatic details.&quot; She also made sure to secure her gear: &quot;Strong winds and sea spray can be hazardous, so use a sturdy tripod and protect your camera.&quot; And finally, Edyta says to: &quot;Be patient and observant – study the rhythm of the waves to anticipate the most impactful moment to shoot.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see more of Edyta&#39;s work, visit her &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.edytaricephotography.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check out &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tag/photo-of-the-day&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;previous Photo of the Day images,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and the stories behind them.

The brand has become a trusted name in the photography world and I recently got hold of its 35mm Slide Scanner to see how it performed on a few boxes of old film transparencies and negative strips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also recently reviewed the SV-3 from Photolux, also called Zuma in the US, and this is a very similar-looking product on the surface. Though I&#39;ll dive into more detail regarding the differences between the two in this review, but some of the key differences are build quality and the Kodak comes with a handy USB cable to draw power. You&#39;ll find the review for the Photolux SV-3 plus many more film scanners and viewers in our Buying Guide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you&#39;ve got a box of old film and transparencies gathering dust perhaps the Kodak 35mm Slide Viewer will be for you. Remember that at this price point of just $40 there&#39;s no scanning ability, so a product like this is purely for looking through and sorting the winners from the dross. Read on to see how it performed and if it seems like a good fit for you or that film-lover in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-kodak-35mm-slide-viewer-specifications&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kodak 35mm Slide Viewer: Specifications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-kodak-35mm-slide-viewer-price&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kodak 35mm Slide Viewer: Price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kodak 35mm Slide Viewer costs US$39.99 / £39.99 &amp;nbsp;and in both countries is about twice the price of the Zuma / Photolux SV-3 which looks near-identical. However, putting their similarities on the surface to one side the build quality of the Kodak is much better and therefore delivers a better experience, plus it comes with a USB power cable and a proper physical instructions booklet which I think could make it worth the extra spend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-kodak-35mm-slide-viewer-design-handling&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kodak 35mm Slide Viewer: Design &amp;amp; Handling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance the Kodak 35mm Slide Viewer looks almost identical to the Photolux SV-3 I reviewed recently, both share the same dimensions of 165x155x80mm and on the outside appear to have the same construction, but that doesn’t tell the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kodak is twice the price of the Photolux SV-3 and for your extra spend you do get better build quality. The joints and tolerances feel much more quality. Pieces of plastic which would flex under pressure on the SV-3 are much more robust with less play in them on the Kodak model and the battery door clicks much more firmly into place so it does feel like a more premium product, you’re not just paying for the Kodak name here. It also comes with a much more professional user manual. The Photolux SV-3 comes bundled with four AA batteries, and whilst the Kodak doesn’t come with these (but is also powered by the same four AA’s) it does come with a USB power adapter – something I really wish the Photolux model came with, so the Kodak wins some points here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kodak 35mm Slide Viewer is capable of taking slides in 5x5cm surrounds whether mounted in plastic or cardboard. It also has two holes on each side of the backlight for a slide of negatives to be passed through and viewed too, this is something the much smaller and cheaper Photolux SV-2 lacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One issue which I also raised when reviewing the Photolux SV-3, is the Kodak 35mm Slide Viewer is fixed in an upright position and this may not necessarily be the most comfortable angle for you – so you might have to resort to picking it up and tilting it forward or back to get the best view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-kodak-35mm-slide-viewer-performance&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kodak 35mm Slide Viewer: Performance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the Kodak and Photolux SV-3 models gave a similar performance though the Kodak did excel in some areas. Let’s start with what they share in common – their backlights both use four small daylight LEDs for even coverage across your film and slides. This is much more even and consistent than the Photolux SV-2 I also reviewed recently which used just one LED bulb in the centre and caused issues with vignetteing and a bright central hotspot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the SV-2, the Kodak 35mm Slide Viewer is rear loaded and requires each slide to be inserted manually, and I wished there was a way to stack up slides in a row to save you having to insert each manually. Both models have a front tray to catch any slides ejected by the ejection button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image quality of both screens were similar and comparable – I was impressed with both. Though both large glass magnifiers are a bit of a magnet for dust and I would have preferred a soft protective bag to be included for storage purposes when it’s not being used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:2000px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;pUwm3fAKEuda7ATmRYJhJK&quot; name=&quot;Kodak 35mm viewer_11&quot; alt=&quot;Kodak 35mm Slide Viewer&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pUwm3fAKEuda7ATmRYJhJK.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2000&quot; height=&quot;1125&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;In addition to being able to view transparencies in plastic and cardboard mounts, the Kodak 35mm Slide Viewer also has a pass-through for strips of film negatives to be threaded through and viewed on the large screen with 3x magnification &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kodak 35mm slide viewer uses four small daylight LEDs which provide even coverage and aren’t too strong to look at for long periods so it’s quite comfortable to view your slides for extended periods. The light coverage is very even so there’s no hotspotting or vignetting either which is good news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One area where the Kodak did have one notable advantage over the cheaper Photolux SV-3 was when dealing with cardboard slides. Slides in plastic surrounds were no problem on either model as they tend to keep their shape well, but some of the slides I tested had warped significantly over time and a few of the worst offenders here would often get caught in the Photolux SV-3, however the tolerances in the Kodak 35mm slide viewer must be more forgiving as this wasn’t an issue when using the same warped slides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kodak also uses a much darker black plastic, whereas the SV-3 is more of a washed out grey, so it looks a bit slicker on your desktop and also the darker color is less likely to cause internal reflections in the magnifying glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-kodak-35mm-slide-viewer-verdict&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kodak 35mm Slide Viewer: Verdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re after a simple slide scanner for culling old film and transparencies you could do far worse than the Kodak 35mm Slide Scanner, it’s a basic and affordable model that lives up to expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your budget can reach it I would suggest going the extra mile and looking at the Kodak 5” Slide N Scan (£140 / $180) as not only is this brilliant for viewing your old pictures, it can scan and digitize them very well too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a shame that this model doesn’t come included with batteries though it does come with a USB power cable which is arguably more useful and it comes packaged with a nice instruction booklet too. Although very similar to the Photolux SV-3 the Kodak model had notably better build quality and this became particularly clear when working with warped cardboard mounts which would jam in the Photolux model but caused the Kodak version no issues and this does help justify its higher price of $40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall I recommend the Kodak 35mm Slide Viewer, it does exactly what it says on the tin, it doesn’t break the bank and it has decent build quality and an instruction manual which seems a bit of a rarity these days. Plus it comes with a USB power adapter so you can power the device without needing AA batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

The move means that L-Mount shooters will soon have even more optics to choose from, and Sirui has already teased the lens that’s coming first to the L-Mount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first lens that Sirui will launch in the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-l-mount-lenses&quot;&gt;L-Mount format&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/news/sirui-announces-a-new-full-frame-85mm-f-1-4-lens-with-af-for-under-usd500&quot;&gt;Aurora 85mm f/1.4&lt;/a&gt;, a full-frame lens geared towards portraits. Sirui’s membership inside the L-Mount means the autofocus lens will be a first-party lens, rather than a third-party lens choice. The lens is one of the brand’s first with an autofocus motor, with the light 504g weight and $499 / £456 / AU$763 list price being key selling points for the existing lens available in Nikon Z, Sony E and Fujifilm X mounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sirui didn’t indicate when the L-Mount Aurora 85mm f/1.4 will be available but said that more lenses will follow before the year is done.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sirui is known for its stills lenses as well as its wide range of cinema lenses, which should pair well with the cameras from Blackmagic, another member of the L-Mount Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The first Sirui autofocus lens to be offered in L-mount will be the full-frame Aurora 85mm f1.4,” the company &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1003586281867914&amp;amp;set=pcb.1003586305201245&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wrote in a Facebook post&lt;/a&gt;. “This will be joined by other Sirui AF lenses later in the year.

But camera companies already tried this…and failed</title><description>&lt;p&gt;If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then cameras should be blushing at all the attention from smartphone brands. At one of the biggest smartphone events of the year, both Xiaomi and RealMe showed off experimental devices that gave smartphones mirrorless-like lenses. But while the Xiaomi Optical Modular System and RealMe Interchangeable Lens Concept were unveiled in 2025, the concept “cameras” took me back a full decade – because camera companies already tried to do the same thing years ago, and failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The year is 2014 and, hot on the heels of the company’s very first full-frame mirrorless camera the year before, Sony took another risk and launched the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/features/10-digital-cameras-that-time-forgot&quot;&gt;QX1&lt;/a&gt;, an APS-C sensor that used E-Mount lenses and attached to a smartphone. The Sony QX1 was, essentially, a camera without the camera. The QX1 offered the sensor and lens mount, but operating the camera was largely done through whatever smartphone it was mounted on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:835px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;GVv8jDZVxs5gCzMohD65U8&quot; name=&quot;sony-qx1&quot; alt=&quot;The Sony QX1 is pictured with its smartphone mount, a smartphone, and a lens on a white background&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GVv8jDZVxs5gCzMohD65U8.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;835&quot; height=&quot;470&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The Sony QX1 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Sony)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony would later go on to announce the XQ10 and XQ30, zooming smartphone-attachable cameras with a point-and-shoot sized sensor, and the XQ100, a smartphone-attachable camera with a one-inch sensor similar to the RX100 series. A year after the XQ1, Olympus tried the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/2013/10/22/food-photography-tips-10-ingredients-for-delicious-images/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Air A01&lt;/a&gt;, a Micro Four Thirds sensor and lens mount that similarly omitted the LCD screen in favor of a smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All four of those cameras from Sony and Olympus have all been discontinued, without successors, indicating that the unusual format wasn’t popular enough to get up off the ground. But, fast forward ten years and now there’s not just the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tech/android-phones/xiaomis-new-concept-attaches-a-micro-four-thirds-camera-to-your-phone&quot;&gt;Xiaomi Optical Modular System&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tech/android-phones/this-realme-concept-attaches-leica-m-mount-lenses-to-your-phone-for-an-unwieldy-old-school-photography-experience&quot;&gt;RealMe Interchangeable Lens Concept&lt;/a&gt;, but the upcoming &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/news/turn-your-phone-into-a-computational-camera-meet-alice-camera&quot;&gt;Alice Camera&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/news/want-to-use-proper-camera-lenses-on-your-phone-check-this-out&quot;&gt;SwitchLens&lt;/a&gt; that raised more than $800,000 on Kickstarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That raises the all-important question: Did cameras like the Sony QX1 fail because the technology wasn’t ready yet, or because not enough people even want a cross between a smartphone and a mirrorless camera?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember trying out one of the early Sony QX cameras. One of my biggest issues with the camera-that&#39;s-not-quite-a-camera was the delay that resulted from having to connect to the phone using Wi-Fi. There was a noticeable delay between when the shutter release was pressed and when the image was actually taken, rendering it fairly useless for shots of moving subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But 2025 technology could help allay some of that issue. The Xiaomi concept camera-phone uses LaserLink, which uses near-infrared to transfer the data to the phone. The RealMe concept eliminates the need to connect wirelessly entirely, where the phone is essentially the mirrorless camera body, just with glass to protect the sensor when a lens isn’t in use. The Alice Camera uses wireless connectivity, albeit in a more modern form including Wi-Fi 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the other part as to why I think cameras like the QX1 and Air A01 failed to take off is that smartphones have terrible ergonomics for taking photos. The thin design is excellent for slipping into a pocket, but not so great for holding up a large lens for long periods without having something to wrap your fingers around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another potential factor at play is that, in 2025, it&#39;s not just photographers buying cameras. &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/features/this-odd-camera-is-trending-and-it-shows-that-camera-brands-dont-understand-what-influencers-want&quot;&gt;Influencers are undoubtedly playing a role&lt;/a&gt; in the market as well and could be drawn to the concept of a smartphone that operates like a mirrorless camera. Ten years ago, influencers were a far smaller niche category of buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameras like the QX1 weren’t the only experiments to try to mix the best of dedicated cameras with mobile photography. Cameras like the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/news/zeiss-zx1-is-it-coming-or-isnt-it&quot;&gt;Zeiss ZX1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/features/cameras-with-apps-it-nearly-happened-before-google-snapped-up-android&quot;&gt;Samsung Galaxy NX&lt;/a&gt; are dedicated cameras, but with an Android operating system that allows them to run photo editing apps and share images without a smartphone at all. But, like the QX and Air series, have both been discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps what is most ironic about smartphone brands&#39; attempts to be more camera-like is that it comes at a time when dedicated cameras are seeing a resurgence. Compact cameras are now in high demand after nearly dying out, in part for the small size and, I could argue because it’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a smartphone. A dedicated camera gives you more than ergonomics, swappable lenses, and better image quality; it gives you the ability to capture memories without being distracted by notifications and apps. Or, for that matter, draining the smartphone battery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m amused but also glad to see the latest attempts to merge smartphones and mirrorless cameras into one device, however. I think the engineers who design cameras and the photographers using them both need creativity and experimenting – even if those experiments feel slightly recycled or never really get up off the ground. But, I certainly won’t be first in line to buy a smartphone-mirrorless mashup.&lt;/p&gt;

We asked the biggest camera brands – and the answer is concerning</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Aluminum, lumber, electricity and pharmaceuticals are just part of the list of industries affected by recent tariffs changes by US President Donald Trump, and the retaliatory tariffs announced by the targeted countries. But, is the cost of cameras and lenses going to end up on that list?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked seven major camera brands to weigh in on the trade war and, while none said that costs would increase for certain, few were able to give any sort of answer either way, as the status of the trade war seems to change on a daily – and sometimes even hourly – basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the brands that I reached out to declined to comment. What I gleaned from the few that did respond is that photographers shouldn’t go out and panic buy cameras and lenses like The Great Toilet Paper Horde of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, with tariffs seemingly to change nearly daily, there’s &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/business/trump-tariffs-economy.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;some uncertainty in the market&lt;/a&gt; as to whether or not prices in the United States will increase as a result. That could be a concern for photographers in the US. Retailers, such as Best Buy, for example, &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pcworld.com/article/2627891/best-buy-and-target-warn-of-price-jumps-caused-by-trumps-tariffs.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;have warned that tariffs could cause price jumps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the major camera brands had to say about the ongoing trade war what photographers should know about where cameras are made and how that affects pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many of the new tariffs seem directed specifically at China, Canada and Mexico, others are directed toward all imports to the US, such as the aluminum and steel tariff that applies to all countries that send the materials to the states. While the aluminum and steel tariff is already in effect, the tariffs for goods from Canada, Mexico and China as well as automobiles have been &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2025/03/07/nx-s1-5320159/trump-week-tariffs-mexico-canada-doge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;delayed until April 02&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A majority of the key camera brands, including Canon, Nikon and Fujifilm, have headquarters in Japan. For example, Canon has manufacturing plants in &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://global.canon/en/mfg/f-01.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Japan and Taiwan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; its &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/cameras/compact-cameras/is-this-why-trendy-compact-cameras-like-the-canon-g7x-are-all-out-of-stock-canon-hints-at-big-factory-changes&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;China-based plant for compact cameras closed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while Japan could easily be considered the camera capital of the world, some more affordable cameras are made in China. Many third-party lens manufacturers are also based in China. The drone giant DJI, which is also the parent of Hasselblad, is based in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at President Trump&#39;s first term (January 20 2017 - January 20 2021) could also hint towards the impact of the proposed tariffs in the non-consecutive second term. For example, in 2019, the US-based &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://investor.gopro.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2019/GoPro-Reiterates-Plans-to-Move-US-Bound-Camera-Production-to-Mexico/default.aspx&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;GoPro announced plans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to move manufacturing for US-bound cameras from China to Mexico due to possible tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tamron began moving much of its manufacturing from China to Taiwan during Trump&#39;s first term. Now the company is saying that there may be an impact under the new tariffs – but that the impact is likely to be minor because of that earlier shift to Taiwan, &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://dclife.jp/camera_news/article/tamron/2025/0304_01.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;according to an interview with DC Life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first-term tariffs, however, were &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2025/03/05/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-trade&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;on a smaller scale than those proposed at the start of his 2025 term&lt;/a&gt;. Under current proposed tariffs, China, Mexico and Canada are expected to see a 25% tariff on goods imported to the US beginning April 02.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulations around the new tariffs seem to be changing with regularity, as countries announce retaliatory tariffs and analysts weigh in on the potential economic costs. The camera industry’s response to the proposed tariffs could likely change as the regulations change. However, for now, most of the camera companies that I talked to either declined to comment or said that, at this time, the company is not currently planning to increase costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As of today, OM System has no plans to increase camera or lens prices due to tariffs,” a company representative told Digital Camera World. “However, the situation is evolving daily, and we continue to monitor it closely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DJI noted that tariffs are one of the factors considered in pricing. “Tariffs are one of several factors that we consider in our comprehensive pricing strategy,” A DJI spokesperson said. “Our commitment to closely monitoring relevant policies and economic indicators is unwavering, as is our dedication to providing high-quality products at the best possible price.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luxury camera brand company Leica manufactures many of its cameras in Germany, where the company’s headquarters is also located, but also &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://leica-camera.com/en-US/press/famalicao-world-50-years-leica-portugal&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;owns a factory in Portugal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Leica does not comment on speculations,” a representative said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canon, Nikon, Fujifilm and GoPro have not yet responded to my request for comment. Panasonic and Sony responded but declined to comment at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, a startup is offering AI-free certificates to verify that creative work is made by humans. To celebrate the official launch, which began on March 18, the company is giving away the first 10,000 certificates for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.aifreecert.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;AI-Free&lt;/a&gt; is a certification project that gives human creators a sort of certificate of authenticity, verifying that the work was created without the use of generative AI. The project is open to all types of creative work, a list that includes photography and videography as well as other genres like literature. Certified artists receive a certificate that can be displayed with the work, along with being listed in an online directory of certified works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The certificate is designed to indicate that a work is free of most – though not all – uses of AI. The company notes that AI &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be used to do computerized tasks that existed prior to the existence of generative AI, such as cropping a photograph. AI cannot be used to change a photograph’s look or feel, to adjust the lighting, or to remove or add an object to the image.&lt;/p&gt;

That system, however, relies on human honesty rather than software to detect whether or not AI was used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does not, for example, require an unedited RAW and finished photograph to be uploaded as part of the vetting process. &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.aifreecert.com/AI_Free_Certification_Standards_v1.1.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;As the AI-Free Standards reads&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;#x201c;AI Free relies upon the honesty of the Creator(s) and applicant in this process.&amp;#x201d;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That honesty-based system may dissuade some creators, particularly after the 10,000 free certificates are given out. The company did not indicate how much a certificate costs after the initial giveaway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry for tools to detect AI has grown along with the generative AI industry, albeit at an arguably slower pace. Currently, some software tools use a mix of metadata and software analysis to determine if AI was used in the creation process, such as &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://thehive.ai/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hive AI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other initiatives come from the software giants themselves. Adobe, for example, is part of the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/news/this-is-the-worlds-first-industry-standard-to-assure-a-photos-authenticity&quot;&gt;Content Authenticity Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, Photoshop and Lightroom users can opt-in to this beta program, which embeds data on how the image was edited into the file. Viewers can then use the online tool to see if an image has Content Authenticity data embedded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/leica-m11-p-review-a-discreet-street-shooter-and-an-anti-ai-ally&quot;&gt;Leica M-11P&lt;/a&gt; was the first camera to embed such credentials right into the image file at its creation, rather than during the editing process.&lt;/p&gt;

They’re very smartly turned out with an all metal build that extends to the mounting plate, barrel and hood, and they all feature a de-clicked aperture control ring. Even so, they’re very competitively priced for ‘fast glass’. The Air series of lenses sets its sights a little lower, with a mostly plastic build but still retaining a metal mounting plate, ditching the aperture ring and the aperture ratings are a little slower. The upside is that Viltrox’s Air lenses are designed to be as small and lightweight as possible, while still delivering impressive image quality and all-round performance, at incredibly low-budget prices. From the Air series, I’ve already been impressed with the APS-C format &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/cameras/lenses/viltrox-af-35mm-f1-7-review-effectively-a-neat-nifty-fifty-for-aps-c-format-mirrorless-cameras&quot;&gt;AF 35mm F1.7 Air&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/viltrox-af-56mm-f17-review&quot;&gt;AF 56mm F1.7 Air&lt;/a&gt;, and the full-frame compatible &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/viltrox-af-20mm-f28-review-it-goes-large-on-viewing-angle-small-in-purchase-price&quot;&gt;AF 20mm F2.8 Air&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/viltrox-af-40mm-f25-review-a-small-lightweight-prime-for-both-full-frame-and-aps-c-mirrorless-cameras&quot;&gt;AF 40mm F2.5 Air&lt;/a&gt;. The new AF 25mm f/1.7 Air is the fifth in the series, aiming to compete with own-brand prime lenses for the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-fujifilm-camera&quot;&gt;best Fujifilm X&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-nikon-camera&quot;&gt;best Nikon Z&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-sony-cameras&quot;&gt;best Sony E-mount&lt;/a&gt; mirrorless cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the AF 25mm f/1.7 Air sets out to undercut the faster f/1.4 lenses in the Viltrox APS-C format line-up. That’s actually quite a tall order, as the metal-bodied &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/viltrox-af-23mm-f14-z-review&quot;&gt;Viltrox AF 23mm F1.4 Z&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/viltrox-af-33mm-f14-review&quot;&gt;Viltrox AF 33mm F1.4 Z&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/viltrox-af-56mm-f14-review&quot;&gt;Viltrox AF 56mm F1.4 Z&lt;/a&gt; primes currently cost around $239 / £185 / AU$377 each, whereas the slightly larger &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/viltrox-af-13mm-f14-review&quot;&gt;Viltrox AF 13mm F1.4 Z&lt;/a&gt; costs around $486 / £377 / AU$767. Even so, the series of Viltrox Air lenses thus far for both APS-C and full-frame cameras wins out for cost-cutting, all five of them selling for about $179 / £139 / AU$282 each. To give further context to the AF 25mm f/1.7 Air, the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/fujinon-xf27mmf28-r-wr-review&quot;&gt;Fujifilm XF 27mm f/2.8 R WR&lt;/a&gt; costs $399 / £399 / AU$646, the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/nikon-z-dx-24mm-f17-review&quot;&gt;Nikon Z DX 24mm f/1.7&lt;/a&gt; costs $277 / £224 /AU$499 and the Sony E 35mm f/1.8 OSS costs $473 / £325 / AU$698. Suffice it to say that the AF 24mm f/1.7 Air is a seriously affordable lens!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-body__section&quot; id=&quot;section-viltrox-af-25mm-f-1-7-air-design-handling&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Viltrox AF 25mm f/1.7 Air: Design &amp;amp; Handling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenses these days no longer seem to follow convention. For this one, the 25mm focal length isn’t entirely unprecedented but it’s pretty irregular, as is the aperture rating of f/1.7 compared with the likes of f/1.8 and f/1.4 lenses. Take the APS-C crop factor into account and the ‘effective’ focal length of 37.5mm still isn’t exactly ‘normal’. As such, it falls between the highly popular 35mm focal length in full-frame terms, and the 40mm which has become a little more common recently. In a nutshell though, you get a viewing angle of 60 degrees, which I actually found very natural for street photography and general shooting, while testing the lens. It’s a little wider than a standard perspective and pretty similar to using a 35mm lens on a full-frame camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think ‘budget lenses’ and you’re probably thinking ‘low-grade glass’. That certainly doesn’t seem to be the case here. Despite its bargain-basement price tag, the Viltrox features 12 optical elements in total, including one ED (Extra-low Dispersion) element, two aspherical elements and two high-refractive elements. It’s the kind of line-up that I’d expect in a rather more expensive lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the focal length and aperture rating are unconventional, the overall design adheres to the ‘keep it simple’ principle. That helps to keep the size and weight to a minimum and at 64x54mm the lens certainly is small, just over a couple of inches long. It’s also really lightweight at 170g (6 ounces), living up to its ‘Air’ billing. The lens barrel is made from plastic but has a robust and high-quality feel to it. Unlike some own-brand lightweight lenses (including all of the Nikon Z DX format lenses that spring to mind) the Viltrox has a hardened aluminum mounting plate, rather than a plastic plate. The mounting plate also features a USB-C port, which can be used for applying firmware updates if and when required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The autofocus system is of the lead-screw stepping motor variety, thus combining a decent turn of speed with near-silent operation, and being equally adept for stills and video capture. As usual, the focus ring is electronically coupled but gives good tactile feedback and enables very precise adjustments. Focusing is full internal so the front element neither extends nor rotates. The focus range itself is 0.3m (or about a foot) to infinity, enabling a 0.11x maximum magnification factor at the short end. That’s not bad but it’s certainly not a lens with any macro potential for extreme close-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t expect everything from such a low-budget lens and, unsurprisingly, the Viltrox doesn’t feature any weather-seals. Even so, build quality feels good overall and unlike many own-brand budget lenses from camera manufacturers, it’s supplied with a petal shaped hood and even a carrying pouch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buy cheap photographic kit and you’ll often be disappointed with the end results. Following in the footsteps of the previous four Viltrox Air lenses that I’ve reviewed, I was actually highly impressed with the quality of the 25mm. Autofocus isn’t really snappy but it’s certainly quick enough for most needs. More importantly for me, it proved consistently accurate throughout my testing, for everything from close-ups to distant subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levels of sharpness are very good, not only in the central region of the image frame but right out to the extreme edges and corners. And that holds true even when shooting wide-open at f/1.7. The lens makes a similarly good job of keeping color fringing to an absolute minimum, as well as keeping ghosting and flare at bay. There’s a slight touch of barrel distortion when uncorrected but it’s fairly minimal and, unlike many compact lenses designed for mirrorless cameras, the Viltrox doesn’t rely on automatic in-camera correction that can’t be disabled.&lt;/p&gt;

The quality of bokeh is quite nice and smooth.EXIF: Sony A7 II (crop mode) + Viltrox AF 25mm f/1.7 Air (1/1000 sec, f/1.7, ISO 100) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Matthew Richards)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, one of the main reasons for buying a relatively ‘fast’ prime lens rather than sticking with a kit zoom lens is to gain a tighter depth of field. It’s ideal when you want to isolate the main subject in a composition by blurring the background. The Viltrox again does well here, combining its good levels of sharpness with fairly smooth bokeh. There’s also very little in the way of axial chromatic aberration (or bokeh fringing) which is often a problem with fast lenses, showing up as color fringing around high-contrast transitions just in front of or behind the plane of focus. All in all, the Viltrox AF 25mm f/1.7 Air is a very good performer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following gallery of sample shots were taken in bright sunny conditions (and in the shadows) at the Bristol Floating Harbour in the UK. I used a variety of subject matter and aperture settings to demonstrate the sharpness of the lens, as well as the quality of its bokeh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We run a range of lab tests under controlled conditions, using the Imatest Master testing suite. Photos of test charts are taken across the range of apertures and zooms (where available), then analyzed for sharpness, distortion and chromatic aberrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use Imatest SFR (spatial frequency response) charts and analysis software to plot lens resolution at the center of the image frame, corners and mid-point distances, across the range of aperture settings and, with zoom lenses, at four different focal lengths. The tests also measure distortion and color fringing (chromatic aberration).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharpness:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levels of sharpness are both impressive and very consistent throughout almost the entire aperture range. Center-sharpness remains very good wide-open at f/1.7 while apertures of between f/4 and f/8 deliver optimum edge/corner-sharpness. Even so, there’s plenty of corner-sharpness at wider apertures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fringing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:1717px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;Hmuh6xBLbruPGwSbnSsynN&quot; name=&quot;Viltrox AF 25mm f1.7 Air - fringing&quot; alt=&quot;Viltrox AF 25mm f/1.7 Air lab graph&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hmuh6xBLbruPGwSbnSsynN.png&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1717&quot; height=&quot;966&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s very little color fringing even out at the extreme edges and corners of the image frame, throughout the aperture range. It’s almost impossible to spot even with automatic in-camera correction switched off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distortion: -1.28&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a touch of barrel distortion but it generally goes unnoticed, even in architectural shooting. And as with color fringing, that’s with automatic in-camera correction disabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;APS-C format cameras have their own particular advantages over full-frame cameras, two of them typically being a relatively compact and lightweight build, and a lower purchase price. The Viltrox 25mm f/1.7 Air fits in with this seamlessly. It’s refreshingly small with a featherweight construction, making it ideal for street photography and candid shooting. It’s also insanely great value for money with a rock-bottom asking price. All in all, this is one lens that truly punches above its weight and purchase price.&lt;/p&gt;

With the launch of the Fujifilm GFX 100RF, however, we are maybe now at the point where, for the first time, medium format is practical for photographers as an everyday camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what&#39;s all the commotion around medium format anyway? Medium format images just hit different. They have a distinct depth, a broad dynamic range and exceptional color rendition, with results that are impossible to replicate with smaller sensors. Portraits pop, landscapes capture extraordinary detail, and artwork has a richness in color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how is the GFX 100RF changing the game? The most noticeable innovation is its remarkably compact form factor. Even the latest &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/the-best-medium-format-camera&quot;&gt;medium format cameras&lt;/a&gt; from Fujifilm and Hasselblad are more cumbersome than their smaller-sensor cousins, making them impractical as an everyday carry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the GFX 100RF smashes this convention with a body that is only marginally larger than a &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/fujifilm-x100vi-review-dont-mess-with-a-winner&quot;&gt;Fujifilm X100VI&lt;/a&gt; and weighs less than a &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/reviews/fujifilm-x-t5-review&quot;&gt;Fujifilm X-T5&lt;/a&gt; and kit lens. It&#39;s a feat of engineering that is painless to carry on casual walks, day trips, or street photography sessions. I am finding the GFX 100RF a joy to carry around Prague where I am currently testing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while you might initially balk at the GFX 100RF’s fixed 35mm (28mm full frame equivalent) f/4 lens as far too limiting, again – it’s the camera&#39;s enormous 102MP medium format sensor to the rescue. The sensor’s resolution enables extensive cropping without significant loss in quality. A 35mm frame can easily be cropped to simulate an 80mm lens, and still yield a detailed 17MP file. This flexibility makes the GFX 100RF unexpectedly versatile, giving the freedom to simulate multiple focal lengths without ever swapping (or carrying) additional lenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unfortunately, practicality involves more than just portability or versatility – price is crucial. The GFX 100RF, while groundbreaking in terms of size and usability, still sits in a premium pricing tier, beyond the comfortable reach of most hobbyists and enthusiasts. It opens medium format to more photographers than ever before, yet remains a significant investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the Fujifilm GFX 100RF represents a genuine shift toward medium format photography being a practical everyday carry, blending portability, versatility, and exceptional image quality in an unprecedented way, and I find it genuinely exciting. While its price might prevent it from being truly accessible to all, it’s a compelling step forward, proving that medium format may finally be ready to leave the studio behind and accompany photographers everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

It truly is one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/the-best-instant-cameras&quot;&gt;best instant cameras&lt;/a&gt; on the market. And yet, at a glance, Instax Mini film can seem rather expensive. But when I found out &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/cameras/instant-cameras/ever-wondered-how-instant-cameras-work-its-both-incredibly-complicated-and-remarkably-simple&quot;&gt;how instant cameras work&lt;/a&gt;, I was astonished to find that the real tech isn’t really the camera but the film itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every single sheet of Instax film – or Polaroid film for that matter – is a scientific marvel. A single sheet of Instax Mini film is comprised of 18 super-thin layers, all working to produce that instant magic. Fujifilm calls sheets of Instax film a “mini darkroom” a–&amp;nbsp;nd that’s not hyperbole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:2000px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;TN3GXysozX4QnzZgPUudaU&quot; name=&quot;Fujifilm_Instax_Mini&quot; alt=&quot;A diagram showing the many layers of a sheet of Instax film&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TN3GXysozX4QnzZgPUudaU.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;2000&quot; height=&quot;1125&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Fujifilm&#39;s diagram illustrates just how complex a sheet of Instax Mini film really is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: Fujifilm )&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, the photosensitive layers are designed to react to different wavelengths (or colors) of light. Only when layered together do you get a full-color image. But the technology doesn’t stop there – exposure is only one half of the process – the image still needs to be developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite learning &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/cameras/instant-cameras/how-to-use-an-instant-camera-my-top-tips-for-polaroid-and-instax-photographers&quot;&gt;how to use an instant camera&lt;/a&gt; years ago, I had no idea why a sheet of instant film had a thicker border at the base of the image. Turns out, this is where the developer fluid is housed. An Instax camera has two rollers; after the film is exposed it’s pushed through the rollers, which results in two key processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thick border that houses the developer fluid is pushed through the rollers first, which breaks the seal and releases the fluid. That fluid is then spread evenly across the image as the Instax film is ejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly the fluid is black, which Fujifilm says simulates a darkroom. Neat, eh? So, the next time you buy a new pack of Instax Mini film, remember, that you’re really purchasing a pack of 20 miniature darkrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s been a talking point since the R5 first launched, and while Canon has made improvements, long recording sessions can still push the camera to its limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmallRig might have the perfect fix. They’ve just released a cooling fan designed specifically for these cameras, and it promises to keep things running cooler for longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;van-image-figure  inline-layout&quot; data-bordeaux-image-check=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-full-width-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-widthsetter&quot; style=&quot;max-width:872px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;vanilla-image-block&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;N2FVWHDjGgPFEyYcRFfvyY&quot; name=&quot;SmallRig Cooling Fan for Canon EOS R5 Mark II &amp;amp; R5&quot; alt=&quot;SmallRig Cooling Fan for Canon EOS R5 Mark II &amp;amp; R5&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N2FVWHDjGgPFEyYcRFfvyY.jpg&quot; mos=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; fullscreen=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;872&quot; height=&quot;490&quot; attribution=&quot;&quot; endorsement=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;expandable&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop=&quot;caption description&quot; class=&quot; inline-layout&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;SmallRig Cooling Fan for Canon EOS R5 Mark II &amp;amp; R5 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;(Image credit: SmallRig)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a simple fan blowing air onto the camera, however, as SmallRig has packed in some serious tech, with a 7000 RPM fan and thermoelectric cooling (TEC) technology. That means it’s actively pulling heat away rather than just circulating air. If you’re filming high-res video, especially 8K, this could be the difference in keeping your camera from overheating and shutting down mid-shoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s handy is that SmallRig has made it adjustable. There are two-speed modes, so you can dial it up or down depending on the environment. Shooting in a hot outdoor location? Crank it up. Just need a little extra cooling in a controlled indoor setup? Keep it in a lower setting to minimize noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of convenience, the installation is as easy as it gets. It snaps on in a second with no tools required and no hassle. That’s a huge plus for anyone who needs to work quickly. The only drawback? Once it’s attached, you won’t be able to fold the camera’s LCD screen, so you’ll need to pop the fan off before packing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this fan arrives just as &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tech/firmware/canon-enhances-autofocus-with-new-firmware-updates-for-the-eos-r5-mark-ii-and-eos-r1&quot;&gt;Canon has rolled out a firmware update aimed at improving temperature control&lt;/a&gt; on these cameras. It seems like heat management has been a focus lately, and SmallRig is jumping in at the right time with a physical solution to complement Canon&amp;#x2019;s software tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/the-best-mirrorless-camera&quot;&gt;mirrorless cameras&lt;/a&gt; being used more and more for high-end video production, overheating is a challenge that&amp;#x2019;s not going away anytime soon. SmallRig&amp;#x2019;s cooling fan, &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.smallrig.com/global/Cooling-Fan-for-Canon-EOS-R5-Mark-II-R5-5063.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;sponsored&quot;&gt;now available&lt;/a&gt; for &amp;#x24;59.99 / &amp;#xa3;58.90 / AU &amp;#x24;96.90 looks like a smart investment for anyone pushing their R5 or R5 Mark II to the limits.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a groundbreaking fusion of Fujifilm’s renowned GFX series&#39; optical supremacy and the beloved portability of the X100 line. In short, it’s a dream camera for street and travel photographers who crave medium format quality without the bulk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, as with any exciting new camera release, accessories soon follow – and SmallRig has wasted no time stepping up to the plate with a premium, color-matched accessory line tailored for the GFX 100RF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmallRig’s new lineup includes two essential accessories for GFX 100RF users: an L-shaped mount Plate with a Wooden Handle and a Leather Case Kit. These additions promise not only an aesthetic balance with the camera but also a boost in usability and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who appreciate a classic, refined look, SmallRig’s Leather Case Kit looks ideal. Available in both black and brown, the half-case is made of wear-resistant, breathable leather that not only enhances the camera’s aesthetics but also offers protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design features a dual-sided grip with a foam front handle and a wooden back panel for a comfortable hold. The back panel attaches via 3M adhesive, ensuring a secure fit without leaving residue. With easy access to all ports, dials, and the battery compartment, it provides practicality without compromise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A microfiber suede lining also protects the camera from scratches, while the kit also includes a matching leather shoulder strap adjustable from 100cm to 110cm and a concave shutter button cap for improved tactile feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, designed for photographers who prioritize functionality and flexibility, the L-Shape Mount Plate with Wooden Handle is both practical and visually cohesive with the GFX 100RF’s sleek design. Available in black and silver to match the camera’s colorways, the plate features a natural wood dual-sided grip for a comfortable hold and a retro aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It integrates an Arca-Swiss quick-release plate for seamless tripod mounting (which may help with concerns about lacking IBIS) and maintains unobstructed access to the battery compartment, focus controls, and card slot. Weighing just 70g, it enhances grip without unnecessary bulk and includes a concave slow shutter button cap for an improved shooting experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fujifilm’s GFX 100RF is already making waves as the most compact and travel-friendly GFX camera to date. SmallRig’s accessory lineup is tailor-made to complement its design, ergonomics, and shooting experience without compromising style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both accessories are &lt;a data-analytics-id=&quot;inline-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.smallrig.com/global/campaigns/Cage-Kit-for-FUJIFILM-GFX100RF?stc=8FW4HQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;sponsored&quot;&gt;available now&lt;/a&gt; at an early bird price of $59.90 / £57.90 / AU $96.90 instead of the usual $69.99 / £67.90 / AU $113.90.&lt;/p&gt;
