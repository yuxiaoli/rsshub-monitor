Tobacco and e-cigarettes will also be kicked out of Doha’s eight stadiums, ensuring fans can enjoy smoke-free air while sitting in their seats watching\r\n    world football’s biggest event.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Implementing tobacco and smoke-free measures at the FIFA World Cup™ has been the goal of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/initiatives/sports-and-health/healthy-2022-world-cup/%22&quot;&gt;unique partnership&lt;/a&gt; between FIFA, the Government of Qatar and the World Health Organization (WHO) to make the tournament healthy and safe. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each of the three partners have long promoted effective tobacco control measures, while also raising awareness around tobacco health hazards,” according to Dr Rayana Bou Haka, WHO Representative to Qatar. “They have also backed the\r\n    implementation of a tobacco-free policy at FIFA sporting events. Still, evidence shows that successful tobacco-free mega sporting events depend on effective communication and enforcement of policies.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://digitalhub.fifa.com/m/6d8f449e26673881/original/FIFA-Event-Policy-on-Tobacco-Clean-23Mar21.pdf/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;FIFA Event Policy for Tobacco&lt;/a&gt; is in line with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/259086?locale-attribute=fr&amp;amp;\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;WHO recommendations for mega-sporting events&lt;/a&gt; and aims to protect people’s right to breathe clean air, uncontaminated by carcinogens and other harmful substances. The policy prohibits smoking and vaping in the stadium\r\n    bowl and only allows it in outdoor designated smoking areas in the outer perimeter of the stadiums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strengthened regulation to make venues safe for fans is part of a unique collaboration between FIFA, WHO and the Ministry of Public Health, Qatar, designed to harness the power of football to protect and promote health for all. This, in turn, will\r\n    create a blueprint for protecting and promoting health at mass gatherings which can then be shared with other sports organisations.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tobacco remains one of the biggest public health threats the world has ever faced, killing 7 million people a year from direct tobacco use, and a further 1.2 million from the effects of second-hand smoke, according to WHO. The tournament organizers have\r\n    taken measures with the goal of ensuring fans can enjoy the match without exposure to second-hand smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIFA has long been committed to countering the use of tobacco, being considered a pioneer among sports organizations in this respect. As far back as 1986, in the days when tobacco sponsorship was commonplace in sports, FIFA announced it would no longer\r\n    accept advertising from the tobacco industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qatar will be assigning a team of 80 tobacco inspectors to support FIFA volunteers and security staff in enforcing the FIFA Event Policy on Tobacco during the FIFA World Cup, which runs from 21 November to 18 December. Visual and audio communications\r\n    tools have also been designed to reach the sizeable audience and raise awareness by FIFA, Qatar and WHO, including Florence, a virtual health worker created by WHO, able to provide digital counselling services to those trying to quit tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Qatar has been a frontrunner in tobacco control in the region,” said Dr Kholoud&amp;nbsp;Ateeq K M Al-Motawaa, head of noncommunicable disease for Qatar’s Ministry of Public Health. “For the FIFA World Cup, tobacco control measures\r\n    have been developed for inside and outside stadiums, especially in public places, while tobacco-free environments in fan zones will be rigorously enforced where supporters without tickets can watch games on large screens surrounded by smoke-free air.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIFA recognises that exposure to second-hand smoke and vapours is harmful. “The FIFA World Cup in Qatar will have a global audience of five billion people, which gives football a significant platform for social change,” said FIFA Head of Sustainability\r\n    Federico Addiechi. “For two decades, global tournaments have been played in tobacco-free environments, but it is a necessary step to strengthen the implementation of that policy in Doha in November and December and we are committed to do so.\&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tobacco has also long represented a serious challenge to ongoing efforts to prevent noncommunicable diseases in many countries. Noncommunicable diseases, mainly cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes are a leading\r\n    cause of premature death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prohibiting the use, sale and promotion of tobacco products at sporting events remains a key step in the battle against tobacco and illness associated with tobacco,” said&amp;nbsp;Vinayak&amp;nbsp;Prasad, WHO technical advisor on tobacco control.\r\n    “The FIFA World Cup being held in Qatar in 2022 offers a powerful opportunity to take global tobacco control efforts to a new level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//strengthened-regulation-of-tobacco-free-venues-at-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//strengthened-regulation-of-tobacco-free-venues-at-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022</guid><pubDate>Sun, 13 Nov 2022 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Novavax vaccine against COVID-19: What you need to know</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 28 September 2022 to ensure consistency of formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Technical Advisory Group for Emergency Use Listing listed Nuvaxovid (NVX-CoV2373) vaccine against COVID-19 and Covovax (NVX-CoV2373) vaccine against COVID-19 for emergency use on 20 December 2021 and 17 December 2021 respectively. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Novavax vaccine will be manufactured in two different facilities. In Europe, the vaccine will be manufactured under the trade name Nuvaxovid and has been approved by the European Medicines Agency, and in India, the vaccine will be manufactured by\r\n    Serum Institute of India under the trade name Covovax and has been approved by the Drugs Controller General of India. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has issued&amp;nbsp;interim policy recommendations&amp;nbsp;for the use of the Novavax (NVX-CoV2373) vaccine.&amp;nbsp;This article provides a summary of those interim recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this article, the vaccine will be referred to as Novavax (NVX-CoV2373).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The background documents are also available&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/363204/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-Novavax_NVX-CoV2373-2022.1-eng.pdf/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-marked=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who can take this vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is safe and effective for all individuals aged 12 and above. In line with the WHO Prioritization Roadmap and the WHO Values Framework, older adults, health workers and immunocompromised persons should be prioritised.&amp;nbsp;Adolescents with moderate to severe immunocompromising conditions belong to the highest priority-use group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Novavax vaccine can be offered to people who have had COVID-19 in the past. But individuals may choose to delay vaccination for 3 months following the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Should pregnant and breastfeeding women be vaccinated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;Emerging post-introduction pharmacovigilance data relating to the use of NVX-CoV2373 in pregnant women have not identified any pregnancy-related safety concerns and based on previous evidence from other protein-based vaccines during pregnancy, efficacy is expected to be comparable to\r\n    non-pregnant women of a similar age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO has identified pregnant persons as a high priority-use group for COVID-19 vaccination, given their increased risk of severe outcomes. WHO recommends the use of the Novavax (NVX-CoV2373) vaccine in pregnant persons when the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant persons outweigh the potential risks. To help pregnant women make this assessment, they should be provided with information about the risks\r\n    of COVID-19 in pregnancy, the likely benefits of vaccination in the local epidemiological context, and the current limitations of safety data in pregnant persons. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend\r\n    delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends the same use of Novavax (NVX-CoV2373) vaccine in breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding persons.Vaccine effectiveness is expected to be similar in breastfeeding persons as in other adults. As Novavax\r\n    (NVX-CoV2373) vaccine is not a live virus vaccine, it is biologically and clinically unlikely to pose a risk to the breastfeeding child. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who is the vaccine not recommended for?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is not recommended for people younger than 12 years of age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine should not take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persons with acute PCR-confirmed COVID-19 should not be vaccinated until after they have recovered from acute illness and the criteria for ending isolation have been met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a body temperature over 38.5°C should postpone vaccination until they no longer have a fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE has thoroughly assessed the data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine and has recommended its use for people aged 12 and above. The WHO EUL process also evaluates the quality of manufacturing along with safety and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very rare serious adverse events of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed though cases typically occurred within a few days after vaccination, and were generally mild.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How efficacious is the vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of Novavax (NVX-CoV2373) has been assessed in three Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials. Of the two Phase 3 trials, both found that the efficacy of the vaccine against mild, moderate, and severe disease is 90%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of Novavax(NVX-CoV2373) in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age was evaluated in an interim analysis of the paediatric expansion portion of the ongoing phase 3 study in United States. The vaccine effectiveness reached 80% for this population.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is the recommended dosage?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends the use of the Novavax (NVX-CoV2373) vaccine as 2 doses (0.5 ml) given intramuscularly. An 8-week interval is recommended between primary series doses of NVX-CoV2373.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A first booster dose is recommended 4-6 months after the completion of the primary series. In accordance with the WHO Prioritization Roadmap, the highest priority-use groups (e.g. older adults, persons with moderate to severe immunocompromising conditions, and health workers) should be offered it first.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further reduce the risk of severe disease, deaths and disruptions of health services, WHO recommends countries should consider a second booster dose 4-6 months after the first booster dose for all older persons, all persons with moderate and severe immunocompromising conditions, regardless of age, adults with comorbidities, pregnant persons and health workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For adolescents 12-18 years of age, there is currently insufficient evidence for recommending a booster dose, except for those with immunocompromising conditions.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can this vaccine be ‘mixed and matched’ with other vaccines?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE accepts two heterologous doses of WHO EUL COVID-19 vaccines as a complete primary series. However, there is limited evidence available on the use of Novavax (NVX-CoV2373) in a heterologous schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it prevent infection and transmission?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As there is not currently sufficient evidence to date to evaluate the impact of the vaccine on transmission, public health and social measures must continue, including use of face masks, physical distancing, handwashing, appropriate ventilation, and other measures as appropriate in particular settings, depending on the COVID-19 epidemiology and potential risks of emerging variants. Government advice on public health and social measures should continue to be followed by both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. SAGE will update this advice as information on the impact of vaccination on virus transmission and indirect protection is assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it work against new variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Phase 3 study conducted in the USA and Mexico during a period in which multiple variants (Alpha, Beta and Delta) were in circulation, vaccine efficacy against mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 was 90%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In view of these findings, WHO recommends the use of Novavax (NVX-CoV2373) vaccine according to the WHO Prioritization Roadmap, even if currently recognized Variants of Concern (VOC) are present in the country. If new VOCs emerge for which vaccine performance\r\n    is compromised, these recommendations will be updated accordingly. There are insufficient data still for Omicron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How does this vaccine compare to other COVID-19 vaccines already in use?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to compare vaccine head-to-head due to the different approaches taken in designing the respective studies, but overall, all of the vaccines that have achieved WHO Emergency Use Listing are highly effective in preventing severe disease\r\n    and hospitalization due to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 28 September 2022 to reflect&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/363204/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-Novavax_NVX-CoV2373-2022.1-eng.pdf/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;updated interim recommendations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be no further updates to this page.

I was extremely independent, and – as a woman – felt very strongly about being a role model for my boys. I think that\r\n    is what you have to learn to hang onto, that on the inside, you haven&#39;t changed.”, she recounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helena is one of six people in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms6BrG-RJJI\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;short film documentary&lt;/a&gt; that sheds light on the experiences of people living with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and mental health conditions\r\n    around the world. People with lived experience often can offer valuable expertise and powerful narratives on how to manage and improve their individual health as well as the health of fellow community members. Their first-hand insights can help shape\r\n    policies, create better health programmes, and inspire others to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO is dedicated to advancing the meaningful engagement of people living with NCDs and mental health conditions worldwide, and has recently established a range of activities and platforms to support this goal. The latest is a new film\r\n    series on the topic in all six UN languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the entire 30-minute documentary, “Nothing for Us, Without Us: listening and learning from people with lived experience”, on WHO’s YouTube channel:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-dark-border\&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhdZ_kwVWoI\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-dark-border\&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QcsDqxf00M\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-dark-border\&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms6BrG-RJJI\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-dark-border\&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RH4tkOAAu4\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-dark-border\&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX9rP-kblf8\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-dark-border\&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn_VQn4p47g\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/noncommunicable-diseases/web-teamartboard-4.png?sfvrsn=2b3735cb_3\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;1150541\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Type 2 diabetes in a changing environment: Ali’s lived experience in Lebanon&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the municipality of Ghobeiry in Lebanon, Ali motivates others in his community to exercise, eat better food and lead a healthier life, after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People may not be taking care of themselves, not because they can&#39;t buy medicine, or are without access to healthy food.

Their voices can unlock opportunities to overcome\r\n    barriers in accessing and sustaining health care.

In light of the global epidemic of NCDs, the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and persisting health inequities,\r\n    understanding the complex determinants of health conditions and upholding principles of respect, value and dignity are equally crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch Hauwa’s story:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-dark-border\&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju-7DHhFMxk\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-dark-border\&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiQOzW2OtUU\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-dark-border\&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9L2kzbvgQk\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-dark-border\&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWpe-XE2M8U\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-dark-border\&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN7A_iZRcrg\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-dark-border\&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_M5OvztpcA\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/noncommunicable-diseases/web-teamartboard-9.png?sfvrsn=13ea94f1_7\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;928436\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Type 1 Diabetes and the next generation of leaders: Mark’s lived experience in Brazil&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I received the diagnosis, it was […] difficult to deal with a situation that was now mine.

That&#39;s why it&#39;s\r\n    not easy to face it., recalls Dr Mark Barone, the Brazil-based vice-president of the International Diabetes Federation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaningful engagement of people with lived experiences also pays particular attention to the voices of marginalized or neglected groups and communities. Community networks play a vital role in providing people with access to critical information and support\r\n    and breaking down siloes and barriers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch Mark’s story:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-dark-border\&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UexWYVA3WRM\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-dark-border\&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hilUL-xp6T8\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-dark-border\&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-4lwr5Mh5c\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-dark-border\&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFmZWbtJ7SQ\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-dark-border\&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUNEOKuEb8s\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-dark-border\&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcOP_zv2oPc\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/noncommunicable-diseases/web-teamartboard-8.png?sfvrsn=5cb6c1a_6\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;1291375\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;font-size:18px;font-weight:700;text-align:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Community action on breast cancer: LaVerne’s lived experience in Australia&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;LaVerne, a breast cancer survivor, mother, and community leader from Redfern, Australia, regularly organizes screenings and health promotion activities with Aboriginal women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have screening days where we bring the mammogram bus. We have lunch, we get hairdressers in, beauty practitioners. It&#39;s a real ladies’ day. It enables them to feel free and talk among themselves.

People with lived experience do not only require a seat at the table of decision-making,\r\n    but should be able to drive processes, co-create programmes, and implement contextual solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch LaVerne’s story:&amp;nbsp;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Regional consultations, case studies, and a new framework for meaningful engagement &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2022, WHO’s Global Coordination Mechanism on NCDs&amp;nbsp;(GCM/NCD) within the Global NCD Platform co-convened several regional consultations and focus groups in all WHO-regions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is now clearer than ever that people with lived experience of NCDs around the world face many challenges to meaningful engagement,” says Dr Svetlana Akselrod, Director of the WHO Global NCD Platform. “What has been missing\r\n            is a clear roadmap for actions, along with connections with all levels of WHO and with WHO Member States. The roadmap and connections have now been established, and this is a significant achievement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insights from all the consultations and the film are feeding into the co-development of the WHO Framework for meaningful engagement of people living with NCDs and mental health conditions, which is scheduled to be released in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaningful engagement of people living with NCDs and mental health conditions emphasizes the diversity and intersectionality of individuals and communities. Aspects of social and political identities, such as gender, ethnicity, religion and socioeconomic\r\n            status to name but a few, overlap and create multiple forms of power and privilege. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By understanding and integrating these multiple layers and perspectives, policy makers, health professionals, health providers and people with lived experiences can move from traditional top-down or one-size-fits-all models of care to co-designing\r\n            health programmes, policies and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//nothing-for-us--without-us--new-film-series-on-people-living-with-noncommunicable-diseases-and-mental-health-condition</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//nothing-for-us--without-us--new-film-series-on-people-living-with-noncommunicable-diseases-and-mental-health-condition</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Valneva VLA2001 COVID-19 vaccine: What you need to know</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was published on 18 August 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Valneva vaccine is a purified, inactivated, and adjuvanted whole virus SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has issued&amp;nbsp;interim policy recommendations&amp;nbsp;for the use of the Valneva (VLA2001) vaccine.&amp;nbsp;This article provides a summary of those interim recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this article, the vaccine will be referred to as Valneva or the Valneva vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The background documents are also available&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Valneva-VLA2001-background/%22&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;font-size:18px;font-weight:700;text-align:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Who can take the vaccine?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is safe and effective for all individuals aged 18 to 50 years. In line with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Prioritization-2023.1/%22&quot;&gt;WHO Prioritization Roadmap&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/who-sage-values-framework-for-the-allocation-and-prioritization-of-covid-19-vaccination/%22&quot;&gt;WHO Values Framework&lt;/a&gt;, older adults, health workers and immunocompromised persons should be prioritized.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Should pregnant and breastfeeding women be vaccinated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the adverse consequences of COVID-19 disease during pregnancy and the favorable safety profile of Valneva, WHO recommends the use of Valneva in pregnant individuals. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine effectiveness is expected to be similar in breastfeeding women as in other adults. WHO recommends the use of the vaccine in breastfeeding women as in other adults. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who is the vaccine not recommended for?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to limited data on the immunogenicity of this vaccine in persons aged 50 years and above, the Valneva vaccine is not recommended for this age group. Similarly, there is no data on efficacy or safety for persons below the age of 18 years for this vaccine. Vaccination of individuals below 18 years of age with this vaccine is therefore currently not recommended.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have an anaphylactic reaction following the first dose of the VLA2001 vaccine should not receive any further doses of the same vaccine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with an acute febrile illness (i.e. with a body temperature &amp;gt;38.5 ºC) should postpone vaccination until they are afebrile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE has thoroughly assessed the data on quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine and has recommended its use for people aged 18 to 50. Safety data is limited for persons over 50 years of age.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How efficacious is the vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no longer considered ethical to ask a group of people to remain unvaccinated for participation in efficacy trials. To counter this, WHO, national and international regulators, as well as manufacturers have agreed to evaluate new vaccines on the basis of immunogenicity data.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the pivotal clinical immunogenicity study, people 30 years and older who received Valneva produced more neutralizing antibodies and had about the same seroconversion as people who received the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know/%22&quot;&gt;Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] vaccine)&lt;/a&gt;, following two doses of the vaccine. People 18 to 29 years who received Valneva produced even more neutralizing antibodies, following two doses of the vaccine. There were only 3 people over the age of 50 and therefore data are limited for people above 50 years. These results indicate that it likely provides sufficient protection against COVID-19 for people 18 to 50 years of age.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is the recommended dosage?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommended primary vaccine series is 2 doses (0.5 ml each dose) given intramuscularly. The second dose is recommended to be administered at least 28 days after the first dose.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is a booster dose recommended for this vaccine?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In accordance with the WHO Prioritization Roadmap, a booster dose is recommended for the highest and high priority-use groups (i.e. older adults, health workers, persons with comorbidities), administered 4–6 months after completion of the primary series. If more than 6 months have elapsed since completion of the primary series, the booster dose should be given at the earliest opportunity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can this vaccine be ‘mixed and matched’ with other vaccines?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Valneva vaccine cannot be used as a heterologous booster post primary vaccination with a mRNA vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Valneva vaccine can be considered as a heterologous booster post primary vaccination with ChAdOx1-S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no data for the use of the Valneva vaccine as a heterologous booster after primary vaccination series with inactivated and protein-based vaccines; until such data become available its use as a heterologous booster post primary vaccination with inactivated or protein-based vaccines are currently not recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;font-size:18px;font-weight:700;text-align:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Does it prevent infection and transmission?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no data available related to the impact of the Valneva vaccine on the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we must maintain and strengthen public health measures that work: masking, physical distancing, handwashing, respiratory and cough hygiene, avoiding crowds, and ensuring good ventilation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it work against new variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies are ongoing to evaluate the ability of Valneva to neutralize variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Initial results are available and indicate that the Valneva vaccine produces fewer neutralizing antibodies against the Delta and Omicron variants, indicating it provides less protection against these variants.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How does this vaccine compare to other COVID-19 vaccines already in use?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to compare vaccines head-to-head due to the different approaches taken in designing the respective studies, but overall, all of the vaccines that have been recommended by SAGE are highly effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalization due to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be no further updates to this page.

All efforts should be taken to achieve high vaccine coverage rates in the highest and high priority-use groups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Should pregnant and breastfeeding women be vaccinated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the adverse consequences of COVID-19 disease during pregnancy and the increasing data supporting a favorable safety profile of BNT162b2 in pregnancy, WHO recommends the use of BNT162b2 in pregnant individuals. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing\r\n    prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine effectiveness is expected to be similar in breastfeeding women as in other adults. WHO recommends the use of the vaccine in breastfeeding women as in other adults. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding because of vaccination.&amp;nbsp;Vaccine-elicited antibodies have been found in breast milk following vaccination of breastfeeding women, suggesting possible neonatal as well as maternal protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who should not take the vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with a history of severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine should not take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with fever (body temperature over 38.5 ºC) should postpone vaccination until they are afebrile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is this vaccine recommended for children and adolescents?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vaccine is authorized for use for those aged 6 months and older, with an adjustment in the recommended dosage for those aged 6 months to 4 years, and an adjustment for those aged 5-11 years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends that countries should consider using the vaccine in children aged 6 months and older to 17 only when high vaccine coverage with 2 doses has been achieved in the highest and high priority-use groups as identified in the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children and adolescents aged 6 months - 17 years of age with comorbidities that put them at significantly higher risk of serious COVID-19 disease, should be offered vaccination, alongside other high-risk groups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In accordance with the WHO Prioritization Roadmap, the priority remains to prevent deaths by achieving high vaccine coverage (primary series and boosters) in the highest and high priority-use groups. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, children are at lower risk of COVID-19. That is why WHO recommend that countries prioritize vaccinating people who have higher risk first, like people who are older, have existing health conditions and health workers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS), a group of experts that provides independent and authoritative guidance to WHO on the topic of safe vaccine use, receives and assesses reports of suspected safety events of potentially international\r\n        impact. In October 2021, the GACVS COVID-19 subcommittee concluded that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have clear benefits in all age groups in reducing hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very rare serious adverse event is myocarditis, which is mainly observed in young males aged 18-35 after the second dose. &amp;nbsp;These myocarditis cases typically occurred within a few days after vaccination, are generally mild, respond to conservative treatment, and are less severe with better outcomes than classical myocarditis or COVID-19 related myocarditis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How efficacious is the vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer BioNTech vaccine against COVID-19 has very high efficacy against severe disease and moderate efficacy against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is the recommended dosage?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all persons aged 12 years and above, SAGE recommends two doses (30 µg, 0.3 ml each), 4-8 weeks apart given intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For children aged 5 to 11 years SAGE recommends two doses (10 µg, 0.2 ml each) given intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle and provided 4-8 weeks apart, preferentially 8 weeks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years, the recommended schedule is three doses (3µg, 0.2 ml each): a schedule of two&amp;nbsp;doses 3 weeks apart followed by a third dose at least 8 weeks after the second dose&amp;nbsp;are recommended according to the label. However, countries could consider extending the interval between the first and second dose up to 8 weeks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compliance with the full schedule is recommended and the same product can be used for both doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends that severe and moderately immunocompromised persons, including children, should be offered an additional dose of vaccine, as part of the primary series. This is due to the fact that this group is less likely to respond adequately to vaccination following a standard primary vaccination series and are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is a booster dose recommended for this vaccine?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first booster dose is recommended for the highest priority-use groups (e.g. older adults, persons with moderate to severe immunocompromising conditions, and health workers) followed by lower priority-use groups, 4-6 months after the completion of the primary series. If more than 6 months have elapsed since completion of the primary series, the booster dose should be given at the earliest opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends countries should consider a second booster dose 4-6 months after the first booster dose for the highest priority-use groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no recommendation for either first or second booster doses in children under the age of 12, except for children with immunocompromising conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can this vaccine be ‘mixed and matched’ with other vaccines?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE accepts two doses from different COVID-19 vaccine platforms of WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) COVID-19 vaccines as a complete primary series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For countries considering mix-and match schedules, WHO has made recommendations to ensure equivalent or favourable immunogenicity or vaccine effectiveness for heterologous versus homologous schedules:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Either of the WHO EUL COVID-19 vectored vaccines (Janssen or AstraZeneca Vaxzervia/COVISHIELD) can be used as a second dose following a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;first dose&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the Pfizer vaccine, dependent on product availability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Pfizer vaccine can also be used as a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;second dose&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;following any of the WHO EUL COVID-19 inactivated vaccines (Sinopharm, Sinovac or Bharat) or any of the vectored vaccines (Janssen or AstraZeneca Vaxzervia/COVISHIELD).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Pfizer vaccines can also be used as a booster dose following any of the COVID-19 vaccines with WHO EUL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Does it prevent infection and transmission?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is modest vaccine impact on transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we must maintain and strengthen public health measures that work: masking, physical distancing, handwashing, respiratory and cough hygiene, avoiding crowds, and ensuring good ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it work against new variants?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine remains effective against virus variants, though for the Omicron variant, vaccine effectiveness against severe and mild disease after two doses is lower compared to Delta, and waning is more rapid. Therefore, a third dose (first booster) is recommended for all adults, and a second booster for the highest priority-use groups. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How does this vaccine compare to other COVID-19 vaccines in use?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to compare vaccines head-to-head due to the different approaches taken in designing the respective studies, but overall, all of the vaccines that have achieved WHO Emergency Use Listing are highly effective in preventing severe disease\r\n    and hospitalization due to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 18 August 2022 to reflect the latest guidance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 19 January 2022 to include the latest guidance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 5 January 2022 to update the latest guidance and ensure consistency of information and formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was&amp;nbsp;updated&amp;nbsp;on 20 April 2021 to ensure consistency of information and formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was corrected on 12 January 2021 to remove an erroneous reference relating to pregnancy.

The benefits of booster vaccination are recognized following increasing evidence of waning vaccine effectiveness against mild and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no recommendation for either first or second booster doses in children under the age of 12, except for children with immunocompromising conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can this vaccine be ‘mixed and matched’ with other vaccines?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE accepts two heterologous doses of WHO EUL COVID-19 vaccines as a complete primary series. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For countries considering heterologous schedules, (e.g. using different COVID-19 vaccine platforms), WHO has made the following recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Either of the WHO EUL COVID-19 vectored vaccine (Janssen or AstraZeneca Vaxzervia/COVISHIELD) can be used as a second dose following a &lt;strong&gt;first dose&lt;/strong&gt; of the Moderna vaccine, dependant on product availability. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Moderna vaccine can also be used as a &lt;strong&gt;second dose&lt;/strong&gt; following any of the WHO EUL COVID-19 inactivated vaccines (Sinopharm, Sinovac or Bharat) or any of the vectored vaccines (Janssen or AstraZeneca Vaxzervia/COVISHIELD)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Moderna vaccine can also be used as a booster dose following any of the COVID-19 vaccines with WHO EUL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it prevent infection and transmission?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is only modest impact on preventing mild infections and transmission, particularly in the context of Omicron.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immunity persists for several months, but the full duration is not yet known.&amp;nbsp;A booster dose restores vaccine effectiveness against Omicron, in particular against severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we must maintain public health measures that work: masking, physical distancing, handwashing, respiratory and cough hygiene, avoiding crowds, and ensuring good ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it work against new variants?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine remains effective against virus variants, though for the Omicron variant, vaccine effectiveness against severe and mild disease after two doses is lower compared to Delta, and waning is more rapid. Therefore, a third dose (first booster) is recommended for all adults, and a second booster for the highest priority-use groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How does this vaccine compare to other COVID-19 vaccines already in use?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to compare vaccines head-to-head due to the different approaches taken in designing the respective studies, but overall, all of the vaccines that have achieved WHO Emergency Use Listing are highly effective in preventing severe disease\r\n    and hospitalization due to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 18 August 2022 to reflect the latest guidance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 10 June 2022 to ensure consistency of formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 23 February 2022 to update the latest guidance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 5 January 2022 to update the latest guidance and ensure consistency of information and formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was revised on 29 January 2021 to include a section dedicated to pregnant women, but the recommendations remain the same.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be no further updates to this page.

In line with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/who-sage-roadmap-for-prioritizing-uses-of-covid-19-vaccines-in-the-context-of-limited-supply/%22&quot;&gt;WHO Prioritization Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/who-sage-values-framework-for-the-allocation-and-prioritization-of-covid-19-vaccination/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;WHO Values Framework&lt;/a&gt; older adults,\r\n    health workers and immunocompromised persons should be prioritised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Astra-Zeneca vaccine can be offered to people who have had COVID-19 in the past. But individuals may choose to delay vaccination for 3 months following the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Should pregnant and breastfeeding women be vaccinated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends the use of the ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant women only when the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant woman outweigh the potential risks. To help pregnant women make this assessment, they should be provided with\r\n    information about the risks of COVID-19 in pregnancy, the likely benefits of vaccination in the local epidemiological context, and the current limitations of safety data in pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AstraZeneca vaccine is not a live virus vaccine, it is therefore biologically and clinically unlikely to pose a risk to the breastfeeding child. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who is the vaccine not recommended for?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with a history of severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine should not take it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is not recommended for persons younger than 18 years of age pending the results of further studies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, a group of experts that provides independent and authoritative guidance to the WHO on the topic of safe vaccine use, receives and assesses reports of suspected safety events of potentially international\r\n    impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very rare adverse event called Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS), involving unusual and severe blood clotting events associated with low platelet counts, has been reported after vaccination with this vaccine. In countries with ongoing\r\n    SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the benefit of vaccination in protecting against COVID-19 far outweighs the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) has been reported very rarely following vaccination. However, a causal relationship with the vaccine has neither been confirmed nor ruled out and more rigorous studies are needed to fully assess the significance of\r\n    these events. WHO will continue to review these rare reports of GBS and to work closely with national regulators to manage potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective at protecting people from the extremely serious risks of COVID-19, including death, hospitalization and severe disease. Read the 16 April 2021 statement of the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety\r\n    on AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine for reports of very rare side effects. The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences classifies rates of adverse events or medicines and vaccines as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very common &amp;gt; 1/10 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Common (frequent) &amp;gt; 1/100 and &amp;lt; 1/10 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uncommon (infrequent) &amp;gt;1/1000 and &amp;lt; 1/100 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rare&amp;gt; 1/10000 and &amp;lt;1/1000 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very rare &amp;lt; 1/10000 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How efficacious is the vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AstraZeneca vaccine has an efficacy of 72% against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, as shown by the primary analysis of data irrespective of interdose interval from trial participants who received 2 standard doses with an interval varying from about\r\n    4 to 12 weeks. Vaccine efficacy tended to be higher when the interval between doses was longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is the recommended dosage?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommended dosage is two doses given intramuscularly (0.5ml each) with an interval of 8 to 12 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For countries that have not yet achieved high vaccine coverage rates in the high-priority groups and that are experiencing high incidence of COVID-19 cases combined with vaccine supply constraints, longer intervals i.e. up to 16 weeks can be considered.\r\n    WHO recommends focusing on achieving high first dose coverage by extending the inter-dose interval, whilst continuing to maximize second dose coverage of vulnerable groups in the context of variants of concern. It should be noted that the full two\r\n    dose regimen of this vaccine is believed to be more protective against variants of concern than a single dose alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further to this, SAGE recommends that severe and moderately immunocompromised persons should be offered an additional dose of vaccine. This is due to the fact that this group is less likely to respond adequately to vaccination following a standard primary\r\n    vaccination series and are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is a booster dose recommended for this vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A booster dose may be considered 4 – 6 months after completion of the primary vaccination series, starting with the higher priority-use groups, in accordance with the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of booster vaccination are recognized following increasing evidence of waning vaccine effectiveness against mild and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need for, and timing of, booster doses for children aged 5-11 years has not yet been determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can this vaccine be ‘mixed and matched’ with other vaccines?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE accepts two heterologous doses of WHO EUL COVID-19 vaccines as a complete primary series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For countries considering heterologous schedules, WHO has made recommendations to ensure equivalent or favourable immunogenicity or vaccine effectiveness for heterologous versus homologous schedules:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Astra-Zeneca vaccine recommendations have also been modified to indicate that either of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) can be used as a second dose following a &lt;strong&gt;first dose &lt;/strong&gt;with the AstraZeneca vaccine dependant\r\n        on product availability. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Astra-Zeneca vaccine can be used as a &lt;strong&gt;second dose &lt;/strong&gt;following any WHO EUL COVID-19 inactivated vaccines (Sinopharm, Sinovac or Bharat) dependant on product availability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When considering booster vaccination after having been vaccinated with ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] COVID-19 [Astra Zeneca] vaccine for the primary series, SAGE considers using a different type of COVID-19 vaccine for a third dose a more favourable option.\r\n    However, maintaining a homologous schedule is still acceptable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Astra Zeneca vaccine remains a suitable option as a heterologous booster to primary series vaccination with a different vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it prevent infection and transmission?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;No substantive data are available related to impact of the vaccine on transmission or viral shedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we must maintain and strengthen public health and social measures that work: masking, physical distancing, handwashing, respiratory and cough hygiene, avoiding crowds, and ensuring good ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it work against new variants?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE has reviewed all available data on the performance of the vaccine in the settings of variants of concern. SAGE currently recommends its use according to the WHO Prioritization Roadmap, even if virus variants are present in a country. Countries should\r\n    assess the risks and benefits taking into consideration their epidemiological situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary findings highlight the urgent need for a coordinated approach for surveillance and evaluation of variants and their potential impact on vaccine effectiveness. As new data become available, WHO will update recommendations accordingly. There\r\n    are no data yet for Omicron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;____________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 13 June 2022 to ensure consistency of formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 16 March 2022 to reflect the latest guidance and ensure consistency of information and formatting. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 5 January 2022 to update the latest guidance and ensure consistency of information and formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be no further updates to this page.

In line with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Prioritization-2023.1/%22&quot;&gt;WHO Prioritization Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/who-sage-values-framework-for-the-allocation-and-prioritization-of-covid-19-vaccination/%22&quot;&gt;WHO Values Framework&lt;/a&gt;, older adults, health workers and immunocompromised persons should be prioritised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sinopharm vaccine can be offered to people who have had COVID-19 in the past. But individuals may choose to delay vaccination for 3 months following the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Should pregnant and breastfeeding&amp;nbsp;women be vaccinated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The available data on the COVID-19 vaccine Sinopharm in pregnant women are insufficient to assess either vaccine efficacy or vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. However, this vaccine is an inactivated vaccine with an adjuvant that is routinely used in many other vaccines with a documented good safety profile, including in pregnant women. The effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine Sinopharm in pregnant women is therefore expected to be comparable to that observed in non-pregnant women of similar age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the interim, WHO recommends the use of the COVID-19 vaccine Sinopharm in pregnant women when the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant woman outweigh the potential risks. To help pregnant women make this assessment, they should be provided with information about the risks of COVID-19 in pregnancy; the likely benefits of vaccination in the local epidemiological context; and the current limitations of safety data in pregnant women. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or considering terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine effectiveness is expected to be similar in breastfeeding women as in other adults. WHO recommends the use of the COVID-19 vaccine Sinopharm in breastfeeding women as in other adults. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who is the vaccine not recommended for?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine should not take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a body temperature over 38.5ºC should postpone vaccination until they no longer have a fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it safe?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE has thoroughly assessed the data on quality, safety and\r\nefficacy of the vaccine and has recommended its use for people aged 18 and\r\nabove.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety data are limited for persons above 60 years of age (due\r\nto the small number of participants in clinical trials). While no differences\r\nin safety profile of the vaccine in older adults compared to younger age groups\r\ncan be anticipated, countries considering using this vaccine in persons older\r\nthan 60 years should maintain active safety monitoring.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How efficacious is the vaccine?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large multi-country Phase 3 trial has shown that 2 doses,\r\nadministered at an interval of 21 days, have an efficacy of 79% against\r\nsymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection 14 or more days after the second dose. Vaccine\r\nefficacy against hospitalization was 79%.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial was not designed and powered to demonstrate efficacy\r\nagainst severe disease in persons with comorbidities, in pregnancy, or in\r\npersons aged 60 years and above. Women were underrepresented in the trial. The\r\nmedian duration of follow-up available at the time of evidence review was 112\r\ndays.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two other efficacy trials are under way but data are not yet\r\navailable.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What’s the recommended dosage?&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends the use of Sinopharm vaccine as 2 doses (0.5 ml) given intramuscularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends that a third, additional dose of the Sinopharm vaccine be offered to persons aged 60 and above as part of an extension of the primary series. Current data does not indicate the need for an additional dose in persons under 60 years of age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends that severe and moderately immunocompromised persons should be offered an additional dose of vaccine. This is due to the fact that this group is less likely to respond adequately to vaccination following a standard primary vaccination series and are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends an interval of 3–4 weeks between the first and second dose of primary series. If the second dose is administered less than 3 weeks after the first, the dose does not need to be repeated. If administration of the second dose is delayed beyond 4 weeks, it should be given at the earliest possible opportunity. When administering an additional dose to over 60s, SAGE recommends countries should initially aim at maximizing 2-dose coverage in that population, and thereafter administer the third dose, starting with the oldest age groups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Is a booster dose recommended for this vaccine?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;A booster dose may be considered 4 – 6 months after completion of the primary vaccination series, starting with the higher priority-use groups, in accordance with the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of booster vaccination are recognized following\r\nincreasing evidence of waning vaccine effectiveness against mild and\r\nasymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Either homologous (a different vaccine product to Sinopharm) or heterologous (a booster dose of Sinopharm) doses can be used.

In line with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Prioritization-2022.1/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;WHO Prioritization Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/who-sage-values-framework-for-the-allocation-and-prioritization-of-covid-19-vaccination/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;WHO Values Framework&lt;/a&gt;, older adults, health workers and immunocompromised persons should be prioritised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sinovac vaccine can be offered to people who have had COVID-19 in the past. But individuals may choose to delay vaccination for 3 months following the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Should pregnant and breastfeeding women be vaccinated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The available data on the Sinovac-CoronaVac (COVID-19) vaccine in pregnant women are insufficient to assess either vaccine efficacy or possible vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. However, this vaccine is an inactivated vaccine with an adjuvant that is commonly used in many other vaccines with a well-documented safety profile, such as Hepatitis B and Tetanus vaccines, including in pregnant women. The effectiveness of the Sinovac-CoronaVac (COVID-19) vaccine in pregnant women is therefore expected to be comparable to that observed in non-pregnant women of similar age. Further studies are expected to evaluate safety and immunogenicity in pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the interim, WHO recommends the use of the Sinovac-CoronaVac (COVID-19) vaccine in pregnant women when the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant woman outweigh the potential risks. To help pregnant women make this assessment, they should be provided with information about the risks of COVID-19 in pregnancy; the likely benefits of vaccination in the local epidemiological context; and the current limitations of safety data in pregnant women. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or considering terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine effectiveness is expected to be similar in lactating women as in other adults. WHO recommends the use of the COVID-19 vaccine Sinovac-CoronaVac in lactating women as in other adults. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who is the vaccine not recommended for?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is not recommended for persons younger than 18 years of age, pending the results of further studied in that age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine should not take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persons with acute PCR-confirmed COVID-19 should not be vaccinated until after they have recovered from acute illness and the criteria for ending isolation have been met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a body temperature over 38.5°C should postpone vaccination until they no longer have a fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE has thoroughly assessed the data on quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine and has recommended its use for people aged 18 and above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety data is currently limited for persons above 60 years of age (due to the small number of participants in clinical trials).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no differences in safety profile of the vaccine in older adults compared to younger age groups can be anticipated, countries considering using this vaccine in persons older than 60 years should maintain active safety monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the EUL process, Sinovac has committed to continuing submit data on safety, efficacy and quality in ongoing vaccine trials and rollout in populations, including in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How efficacious is the vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large phase 3 trial in Brazil showed that two doses, administered at an interval of 14 days, had an efficacy of 51% against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, 100% against severe COVID-19, and 100% against hospitalization starting 14 days after receiving the second dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is the recommended dosage?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends the use of Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine as 2 doses (0.5 ml) given intramuscularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends that a third, additional dose of the Sinovac vaccine be offered to persons aged 60 and above as part of an extension of the primary series. Current data does not indicate the need for an additional dose in persons under 60 years of age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends that severe and moderately immunocompromised persons should be offered an additional dose of vaccine. This is due to the fact that this group is less likely to respond adequately to vaccination following a standard primary vaccination series and are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends an interval of 2–4 weeks between the first and second dose of the primary series. If the second dose is administered less than 2 weeks after the first, the dose does not need to be repeated. If administration of the second dose is delayed beyond 4 weeks, it should be given at the earliest possible opportunity. When administering an additional dose to over 60s, SAGE recommends countries should initially aim at maximizing 2-dose coverage in that population, and thereafter administer the third dose, starting with the oldest age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Is a booster dose recommended for this vaccine?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;A booster dose may be considered 4 – 6 months after completion of the primary vaccination series, starting with the higher priority-use groups, in accordance with the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of booster vaccination are recognized following increasing evidence of waning vaccine effectiveness against mild and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Either heterologous (a different vaccine product to Sinovac) or&amp;nbsp;homologous (a booster dose of Sinovac) doses can be used. Studies in Chile and Brazil found that heterologous boosting resulted in superiormore robust immune responses than homologous boosting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can this vaccine be ‘mixed and matched’ with other vaccines?&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE accepts two heterologous doses of WHO EUL COVID-19 vaccines as a complete primary series. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure equivalent or favourable immunogenicity or vaccine effectiveness either of the WHO EUL COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) or the WHO EUL COVID-19 vectored vaccines (AstraZeneca Vaxzevria/COVISHIELD or Janssen) can be used as a second dose following a first dose with the Sinovac vaccine dependant on product availability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it prevent infection and transmission?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no substantive data available related to the impact of COVID-19 vaccine Sinovac-CoronaVac on transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, WHO reminds of the need to stay the course and continue practicing public health and social measures that should be used as a comprehensive approach to prevent infection and transmission. These measures include wearing a mask, physical distancing, handwashing, respiratory and cough hygiene, avoiding crowds and ensuring adequate ventilation according to local national advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it work against new variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an observational study, the estimated effectiveness of Sinovac-CoronaVac in health workers in Manaus, Brazil, where P.1 accounted for 75% of SARS-CoV-2 samples was 49.6% against symptomatic infection (4). Effectiveness has also been shown in an observational study in Sao Paulo in the presence of P1 circulation (83% of samples).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still insufficient data for Omicron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE currently recommends using this vaccine, according to the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How does this vaccine compare to other vaccines already in use?&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We cannot compare the vaccines head-to-head due to the different approaches taken in designing the respective studies, but overall, all of the vaccines that have achieved WHO Emergency Use Listing are highly effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalization due to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 10 June 2022 to ensure consistency of formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be no further updates to this page.

However, based on previous experience with other vaccines during pregnancy, the effectiveness\r\n    of the Ad5-nCoVAd5-nCoV vaccine in pregnant women is expected to be comparable to that observed in non-pregnant women of similar age. Further studies are expected to evaluate safety and immunogenicity in pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the interim, WHO recommends the use of the Ad5-nCoV vaccine in pregnant women when the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant woman outweigh the potential risks. To help pregnant women make this assessment, they should be provided with information\r\n    about the risks of COVID-19 in pregnancy; the likely benefits of vaccination in the local epidemiological context; and the current limitations of safety data in pregnant women.

WHO does\r\n    not recommend delaying pregnancy or considering terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends the same use of Ad5-nCoV vaccine in breastfeeding as in other adults. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding following vaccination.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who is the vaccine not recommended for?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A history of anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine is considered a contraindication to vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with an immediate non-anaphylactic allergic reaction to the first dose (i.e. urticaria, angioedema without respiratory signs or symptoms that occur within 4 hours of administration) should not receive additional doses, unless recommended after\r\n    review by a health professional with specialist expertise. &amp;nbsp;Similarly, anyone who experienced thrombotic thrombocytopenic syndrome (TTS) following the first dose of this vaccine should not receive a second dose of the same vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persons with acute PCR-confirmed COVID-19 should not be vaccinated until after they have recovered from acute illness and the criteria for ending isolation have been met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE has thoroughly assessed the data on quality, safety and efficacy of this vaccine and has recommended its use for people aged 18 and above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), a very rare syndrome of blood clotting combined with low platelet counts, has been reported around 3–30 days following vaccination with Ad5-nCoV.&amp;nbsp; A causal relationship between the vaccine and\r\n    Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome is considered plausible although more evidence is needed to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In countries with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the benefit of vaccination in protecting against COVID-19 far outweighs the risks of TTS. However, benefit–risk assessments may differ from country to country. As part of the EUL process, CanSino\r\n    has committed to continuing submit data on safety, efficacy and quality in ongoing vaccine trials and rollout in populations, including in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How efficacious is the vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical trial data showed that the Ad5-nCoV vaccine had an efficacy of 58% against symptomatic disease and 92% against severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is the recommended dosage?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends the use of Ad5-nCoV vaccine as a single dose (0.5 ml) given intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is a booster recommended for the vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In accordance with the WHO Prioritization Roadmap, a booster dose is recommended for the highest and high priority-use groups (i.e. older adults, health workers, persons with comorbidities), administered 4–6 months after completion of the primary\r\n    series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can this vaccine be ‘mixed and matched’ with other vaccines?&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ad5-nCoV booster dose following a primary series with the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine developed by Sinovac (CoronaVac) was associated with higher vaccine effectiveness compared to a homologous CoronaVac booster. Ad5-nCoV vaccine may be used as a\r\n    booster dose following a completed primary series using any other EUL COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heterologous boosters should take into account current vaccine supply, vaccine supply projections, and other access considerations, alongside the potential benefits and risks of the specific products being used.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it prevent infection and transmission?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As recent data suggest limited effect of the vaccine on transmission, particularly against Omicron, it is advisable that public health and social measures to reduce SARS-CoV‑2 transmission should be considered.&amp;nbsp; These measures include wearing a mask,\r\n    physical distancing, handwashing, respiratory and cough hygiene, avoiding crowds and ensuring adequate ventilation according to local national advice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it work against new variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus?&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principal clinical trial for this product was completed in January 2021, before the emergence of Delta and Omicron variants. There are still insufficient data for these more recent variants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE currently recommends using this vaccine, according to the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How does this vaccine compare to other vaccines already in use?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We cannot easily compare vaccines head-to-head due to different approaches taken in designing the respective efficacy and effectiveness studies, but overall, all of the vaccines that have achieved WHO Emergency Use Listing can be considered safe and highly\r\n    effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalization due to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 10 June 2022 to update the latest guidance and ensure consistency of information and formatting.&lt;/em&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be no further updates to this page.

But individuals may choose to delay vaccination for 3 months following the infection.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should pregnant and breastfeeding women be vaccinated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the adverse consequences of COVID-19 disease during pregnancy, WHO recommends the use of BBV152 in pregnant individuals when the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant person outweigh the potential risks. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends the same use of BBV152 vaccine in breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women. Data are not available on the potential benefits or possible risks of the BBV152 vaccine to breastfed children. However, as BBV152 vaccine is not a live virus vaccine, it is biologically and clinically unlikely to pose a risk to the breastfeeding child. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is the vaccine not recommended for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is not recommended for people younger than 18 years of age. Safety and immunogenicity data for under-18s are currently being generated but until such data are available, vaccination of individuals in this age group is not recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine should not take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persons with acute PCR-confirmed COVID-19 should not be vaccinated until after they have recovered from acute illness and the criteria for ending isolation have been met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a body temperature over 38.5°C should postpone vaccination until they no longer have a fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE has thoroughly assessed the data on safety and efficacy of\r\n    the vaccine and has recommended its use for people aged 18 and above.&amp;nbsp; The\r\n    WHO EUL process also evaluates the quality of manufacturing along with safety\r\n    and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety data is currently limited for persons above 60 years of\r\n    age (due to the small number of participants of this age group in clinical\r\n    trials). However, the trial data indicate that the vaccine has an acceptable\r\n    safety profile for this age group and WHO recommends the vaccine for use in\r\n    persons aged 60 years and over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BBV152 has been licensed for use in 23 countries globally;\r\n    however roll-out has been limited mostly to India where over 77 million doses\r\n    have been distributed and used. Vaccine effectiveness studies are being\r\n    conducted in India, and results will be available in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How efficacious is the vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 of any severity, 14 or more\r\n    days post dose 2, was 78%. Vaccine efficacy against severe disease is 93%. In\r\n    adults aged less than 60 years, efficacy was 79%; and in those aged 60 years\r\n    and over it was 68%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the recommended dosage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends the use of BBV152 vaccine as 2 doses (0.5 ml) given intramuscularly. The vaccine can be administered with an interval of 4 weeks. It is recommended that all vaccinated individuals receive two doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the second dose is inadvertently administered less than 4 weeks after the first, the dose does not need to be repeated. If administration of the second dose is delayed beyond 4 weeks, it should be given at the earliest possible opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends that severe and moderately immunocompromised persons should be offered an additional dose of vaccine. This is due to the fact that this group is less likely to respond adequately to vaccination following a standard primary vaccination series and are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is a booster dose recommended for this vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A booster dose may be offered 4-6 months after completing the\r\n    primary series for the highest-risk groups, for example, older adults, health\r\n    workers, persons with comorbidities. In line with the SAGE Prioritization\r\n    Roadmap, WHO recommends countries should prioritize booster coverage amongst\r\n    higher priority-use groups before offering vaccine doses to lower priority-use\r\n    groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of booster doses are recognized following\r\n    increasing evidence of waning vaccine effectiveness against mild and asymptomatic\r\n    SARS-CoV-2 infection over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can this vaccine be ‘mixed and matched’ with other vaccines? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE accepts two heterologous doses of WHO EUL COVID-19 vaccines as a complete primary series. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure equivalent or favourable immunogenicity or vaccine effectiveness either of the WHO EUL COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) or the WHO EUL COVID-19 vectored vaccines (AstraZeneca Vaxzevria/COVISHIELD or Janssen) can be used as a second dose following a first dose with the Bharat COVID-19 vaccine dependant on product availability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it prevent infection and\r\n        transmission?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine efficacy against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was\r\n    64%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As there is not currently sufficient evidence to date to\r\n    evaluate the impact of the vaccine on transmission, public health and social\r\n    measures must continue, including use of face masks, physical distancing,\r\n    handwashing, appropriate ventilation, and other measures as appropriate in\r\n    particular settings, depending on the COVID-19 epidemiology and potential risks\r\n    of emerging variants. Government advice on public health and social measures\r\n    should continue to be followed by both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.\r\n    SAGE will update this advice as information on the impact of vaccination on\r\n    virus transmission and indirect protection is assessed.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it work against new variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine efficacy against all variant-related COVID-19 disease\r\n    was 71% with an efficacy of 90% against Kappa, and 65% against Delta. In view\r\n    of these findings, WHO recommends the use of BBV152 vaccine according to the\r\n    WHO Prioritization Roadmap, even if currently recognized Variants of Concern\r\n    (VOC) are present in the country. &amp;nbsp;If new VOCs emerge for which vaccine\r\n    performance is compromised, these recommendations will be updated\r\n    accordingly.&amp;nbsp;There are no data yet for Omicron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this vaccine compare to other COVID-19 vaccines already in use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to compare the vaccines head-to-head due to the different approaches taken in designing the respective studies, but overall, all of the vaccines that have achieved WHO Emergency Use Listing are highly effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalization due to COVID-19.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 10 June 2022 to ensure consistency of formatting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 16 March 2022 to reflect the latest guidance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 5 January 2022 to update the latest guidance and ensure consistency of information and formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be no further updates to this page.

In line with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Prioritization-2023.1/%22&quot;&gt;WHO Prioritization Roadmap&lt;/a&gt; and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/who-sage-values-framework-for-the-allocation-and-prioritization-of-covid-19-vaccination/%22&quot;&gt;WHO Values Framework&lt;/a&gt;, older adults, health workers and immunocompromised persons    should be prioritised.\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The Janssen vaccine can be offered to people who have had COVID-19 in the past. But individuals may wish to choose to delay vaccination for 3 months following the infection.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can immunocompromised persons take the vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persons with immunocompromising conditions are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 and should be vaccinated. The WHO’s Interim recommendations for an extended primary series with an additional vaccine dose for COVID-19 vaccination in immunocompromised persons can be viewed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-immunocompromised-persons/%22&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends a second dose for all people with immunocompromising conditions aged 18 years and older. Available evidence suggests that this dose should be given 1–3 months after the first dose in order to increase protection as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most appropriate timing for a third dose may vary depending on the epidemiological setting and the extent and timing of immune suppressive therapy, and should be discussed with a Doctor. There are no data available to determine the need and timing of additional doses. As data become available, these recommendations will be updated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Should pregnant women be vaccinated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Janssen vaccine is a nonreplicating vaccine. No safety issues have been identified following vaccination of more than 1,600 pregnant women using this vaccine platform for vaccines against other pathogens, such as the Ebola virus. Animal developmental and reproductive toxicity studies show no harm to the development of the foetus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO has identified pregnant women as a priority-use group for COVID-19 vaccination, given their increased risk of severe outcomes. WHO recommends the use of the Janssen vaccine in pregnancy when the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant person outweigh the potential risks. This assessment should be made with the appropriate information on risks and benefits. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who is the vaccine not recommended for?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine should not take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have had Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (TTS) following the first dose of this vaccine should not receive a second dose of the same vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a body temperature over 38.5ºC should postpone vaccination until they no longer have a fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vaccine is not recommended for persons younger than 18 years of age pending the results of further studies in that age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What’s the recommended dosage?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single dose regimen, in keeping with the EUL recommendations for this vaccine, remains an acceptable option for countries, especially when faced with supply constraints and difficulties to reach remote populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, given the evidence demonstrating improved protection with a second dose, WHO recommends that all efforts should be taken to provide two doses, in particularly to the highest and high priority-use. The administration of the second dose will result in increased protection against symptomatic infection, and against severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What intervals should there be between doses?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;WHO recommends that the second dose should be given 2-6 months after the first dose. Studies show there is improved immunogenicity with longer inter-dose interval and countries could therefore consider an inter-dose interval of up to 6 months.&lt;h3&gt;Is it safe?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE has thoroughly assessed the data on quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine and has recommended its use for people aged 18 and above.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vaccine has also undergone review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and found to be safe for use.&amp;nbsp;A rare serious adverse event is the “thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome” and “Guillain-Barre Syndrome”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How efficacious is the vaccine?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies show that a second dose 2 months after the initial dose substantially increases efficacy, especially against symptomatic infections, including when caused by SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. In the US, the vaccine efficacy of 2 doses, 2 months apart, was 94%. In comparison, the single dose vaccine efficacy in the USA was 72%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in the single dose trial the efficacy against symptomatic disease two months after vaccination had fallen to about 50%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad26.COV2.S has an acceptable reactogenicity profile after both the first dose and second dose, with the reactogenicity post-second dose being similar or milder than post-dose 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it work against&amp;nbsp;new variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE has reviewed all available data on the performance of the vaccine in the settings of the variants of concern. In clinical trials this vaccine has been tested against a variety of SARS-CoV-2 virus variants, including B1.351 (first identified in South Africa) and P.2 (first identified in Brazil), and found to be efficacious. There are no data yet for the performance of this vaccine against the Omicron variant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE currently recommends using this vaccine, according to the WHO Prioritization Roadmap, even if variants of concern are present in a country. As new data becomes available, WHO will update recommendations accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Interchangeability between vaccine products and platforms&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;When a second dose is given, it is currently recommended that the same product should be used for both doses.&lt;p&gt;Evolving evidence suggests that heterologous COVID-19 vaccine schedules (using WHO EUL vaccine products from different platforms) may be more immunogenic and effective than homologous schedules, depending on the specific platforms and order of the products used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, data shows that individuals who have received one dose of the Janssen &amp;nbsp;vaccine followed by a second dose of mRNA vaccine have higher neutralising antibody concentrations than individuals who received two doses of the Janssen vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies also show that the Janssen vaccine is as effective in boosting antibodies as a homologous third dose of mRNA vaccine when given six months after a primary two-dose series of mRNA vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Co-administration with inactivated influenza vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 vaccines may be given concomitantly, or any time before or after, other adult vaccines including inactivated influenza vaccines. &lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;Different arms for injection should be used when both vaccines are delivered during the same visit. Continued pharmacovigilance monitoring is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it prevent infection and transmission?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no substantive data available related to the impact of Ad26.COV2.S on transmission of virus that causes COVID-19 disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we must maintain and strengthen public health measures that work: masking, physical distancing, handwashing, respiratory and cough hygiene, avoiding crowds and ensuring good ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Adverse Events&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;As of 27 April 2022, more than 50&amp;nbsp; million doses of Ad26.COV2.S have been administered worldwide (the majority of doses in the USA, Europe, South Africa and Brazil).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;More information is available in the interim recommendations available&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1/%22&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;and includes the most recent data on any safety concerns, all of which are classified as very rare under the classification set by the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 6 June 2022 to include the latest data and to ensure consistency of information and formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be no further updates to this page.

More than a quarter of all deaths every year – around 30 000&amp;nbsp;in total – are due to the disease. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypertension – also known as high blood pressure – is a serious medical condition and a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease. People living with hypertension have persistently raised pressure in their blood vessels, which results in\r\n    their hearts having to work much harder. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people with hypertension are unaware of the condition because there are usually no warning signs or symptoms. That is why it is sometimes called a “silent killer”. While hypertension can be detected quickly and easily by a health care\r\n    professional, far too many people are unaware that they are suffering from this condition or are at risk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around one in four men and one in five women live with hypertension in Chile – equivalent to more than four million people. Fortunately, rates of hypertension have been steadily declining during the past years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encouraging progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This decline is the result of sustained action on noncommunicable diseases over a period of several decades in Chile. Hypertension was the focus of the country’s first chronic disease programme run in primary health centres across the country and,\r\n    since the mid-1980s, the country has been working hard to improve the rates of detection and control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the turn of this century, Chile has conducted three national health surveys that collect population data on hypertension. Data has been collected on awareness, prevalence, treatment coverage and types of medication, as well as levels of hypertension\r\n    control. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09483-x/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;recent analysis&lt;/a&gt; of these surveys found that hypertension rates have fallen steadily since the first survey. Following the\r\n    creation of national targets, levels of controlled hypertension more than doubled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, hypertension has been included within Chile’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/WHO-HIS-HGF-CaseStudy-15.3/%22&quot;&gt;universal health coverage plan&lt;/a&gt; known as “AUGE”(Universal Access with Explicit Guarantees). This plan gives formal guarantees to people living with hypertension on access to quality care as well as protection\r\n    from financial difficulties as a result of health-care costs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), with support from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, worked with the Ministry of Health of Chile to implement an innovative treatment project in two hypertension clinics.\r\n    This project used an algorithm to treat hypertension which made medicines both more available and affordable; implemented clinical registries to monitor patients with hypertension; and promoted “task-sharing” – the process through\r\n    which local health workers provided services that would otherwise only be available in specialist clinics. This initiative led to improved hypertension management at the primary health care level. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Pedro Ordunez, Advisor for Chronic Diseases at PAHO, this innovative work had three main benefits:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“First, the clinics achieved higher rates of blood pressure control among people living with hypertension. Second, patient data are used to provide feedback to local health centres on how their hypertension services are performing. And third, the project has led to policy improvements in how hypertension medicines are provided, including a pilot of fixed-dose combination medicines that improved adherence to medication.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Global Hearts Initiative &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, Chile was one of the first countries to adopt the WHO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news/item/15-09-2016-global-hearts-initiative/%22&quot;&gt;Global Hearts Initiative&lt;/a&gt;.\r\n Since its introduction, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789240001367/%22&quot;&gt;HEARTS technical package&lt;/a&gt; has enabled standardized hypertension treatment to be provided to three million people, in 18 lower- and middle-income countries. Sixteen of these countries are in the Pan American Region, with\r\n    more than 700 health centres involved. Technical support from PAHO to ministries of health across the Region, through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.paho.org/en/hearts-americas/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;HEARTS in the Americas&lt;/a&gt; Initiative, is helping countries\r\n    like Chile to adopt global best practices to manage hypertension.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of HEARTS, more than half of the health services in Chile use guidelines for managing cardiovascular disease. And a similar proportion of primary health care sites offer “risk stratification” – a tool for identifying\r\n    those most vulnerable to heart disease so that they can receive tailored interventions. As well as reducing rates of hypertension, these activities have led to progress in hypertension control at the population level in Chile. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Still to come &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Anselm Hennis, Director of Noncommunicable Diseases at PAHO, reflects that the results achieved in Chile so far can serve as a blueprint for other countries in the Region:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Chile’s declining hypertension prevalence is the result of sustained commitment for action on noncommunicable diseases. By combining evidence, investment and political priority, Chile is showing us that many of the measures to improve hypertension control not only already exist but are also effective. Chile continues to serve as a shining example of how countries can advance hypertension control, which will not only benefit people living with hypertension, but their families, communities and society as well”. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, action on hypertension is not only critical to prevent more deaths from cardiovascular disease in Chile, but also to improve the quality of lives for the nation’s four million people who still live with hypertension. For this reason, the Ministry\r\n    of Health of Chile has committed to adopt HEARTS in all primary health care centres by 2030.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2017, WHO began a partnership with Resolve to Save Lives, an initiative of Vital Strategies, to support national governments to implement the Global Hearts Initiative. Other partners contributing to the Global Hearts Initiative are: the CDC\r\n    Foundation, the Global Health Advocacy Incubator, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, PAHO and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &amp;nbsp;Since implementation of the programme in 2017 in 18 low- and middle-income\r\n    countries, 3 million people have been put on protocol-based hypertension treatment through person-centred models of care. These programmes demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of standardized hypertension control programmes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//chile-where-action-on-hypertension-is-saving-lives</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//chile-where-action-on-hypertension-is-saving-lives</guid><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Vaccine efficacy, effectiveness and protection</title><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution.

Like all vaccines, they do not fully protect everyone who is vaccinated, and&amp;nbsp; we do not yet know how well they can prevent people from transmitting the virus to others. So as well as getting vaccinated, we must also continue with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/%22&quot;&gt;other measures&lt;/a&gt; to fight the pandemic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine efficacy and effectiveness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;All COVID-19 vaccines &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/covid-19-vaccines/%22&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt; by WHO for&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/teams/regulation-prequalification/eul/%22&quot;&gt; emergency use listing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt; have been through randomized clinical trials to test their quality, safety and efficacy. To be approved, vaccines are required to have a high efficacy rate of 50% or above. After approval, they continue to be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news/item/17-05-2022-statement-for-healthcare-professionals-how-covid-19-vaccines-are-regulated-for-safety-and-effectiveness/%22&quot;&gt;monitored&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;for ongoing safety and effectiveness. But what is the difference between efficacy and effectiveness?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vaccine’s &lt;strong&gt;efficacy&lt;/strong&gt; is measured in a controlled clinical trial and is based on how many people who got vaccinated developed the ‘outcome of interest’ (usually disease) compared with how many people who got the placebo (dummy vaccine) developed the same outcome. Once the study is complete, the numbers of sick people in each group are compared, in order to calculate the relative risk of getting sick depending on whether or not the subjects received the vaccine. From this we get the efficacy – a measure of how much the vaccine lowered the risk of getting sick. If a vaccine has high efficacy, a lot fewer people in the group who received the vaccine got sick than the people in the group who received the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, for example, let’s imagine a vaccine with a proven efficacy of 80%. This means that – out of the people in the clinical trial – those who received the vaccine were at a 80% lower risk of developing disease&amp;nbsp; than the group who received the placebo. This is calculated by comparing the number of cases of disease in the vaccinated group versus the placebo group. An efficacy of 80% does&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;mean that 20% of the vaccinated group will become ill.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/who-topic-12_efficacy-vs-effectiveness.jpg?sfvrsn=4ff45f33_16&amp;amp;Status=Master\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;100\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/who-topic-12_efficacy.jpg?sfvrsn=efdd88c3_12&amp;amp;Status=Master\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;100\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/who-topic-12_80-percent.jpg?sfvrsn=ef97bc1d_9&amp;amp;Status=Master\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;100\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine &lt;strong&gt;effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt; is a measure of how well vaccines work in the real world. Clinical trials include a wide range of people – a broad age range, both sexes, different ethnicities and those with known medical conditions – but they cannot be a perfect representation of the whole population. The efficacy seen in clinical trials applies to specific outcomes in a clinical trial . Effectiveness is measured by observing how well the vaccines work to protect communities as a whole. Effectiveness in the real world can differ from the efficacy measured in a trial, because we can’t predict exactly how effective vaccination will be for a much bigger and more variable population getting vaccinated in more real life conditions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine protection and timing&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines offer strong protection, but that protection takes time to build. People must take all the required doses of a vaccine to build full immunity. For two-dose vaccines, vaccines only give partial protection after the first dose, and the second dose increases that protection. It takes time before&amp;nbsp;protection reaches its maximum level a few weeks after the second dose. For a one-dose vaccine, people will have built maximum immunity against COVID-19 a few weeks after getting vaccinated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/who-topic-12_time.jpg?sfvrsn=38b2d5fb_14&amp;amp;Status=Master\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;100\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine protection and infection&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines can stop most people from getting sick with COVID-19, but not everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after someone takes all of the recommended doses and waits a few weeks for immunity to build up, there is still a chance that they can get infected. Vaccines do not provide full (100%) protection, so ‘breakthrough infections’ – where people get the virus, despite having been fully vaccinated – will occur.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/who-topic-12_effectiveness.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=812ca477_9\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;100\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If vaccinated people do get sick, they are likely to have milder symptoms, in general &#39;It is very rare for someone vaccinated to experience severe illness or die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine protection and transmission&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 vaccines are crucial tools in the pandemic response and protect against severe disease and death. Vaccines provide at least some protection from infection and transmission, but not as much as the protection they provide against serious illness and death. More evidence is needed to determine exactly how well they stop infection and transmission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being vaccinated, individuals should continue taking simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Get tested if you are sick, even if you’ve been vaccinated. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/even-if-you-are-vaccinated.png?sfvrsn=1660f73c_9&amp;amp;Status=Master\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;100\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine protection and variants&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When cases increase and transmission accelerates, it’s more likely that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-effects-of-virus-variants-on-covid-19-vaccines/%22&quot;&gt;new dangerous and more transmissible variants&lt;/a&gt; emerge, which can spread more easily or cause more severe illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on what we know so far, vaccines are proving effective against existing variants, especially at preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death. However, some variants are having a slight impact on the ability of vaccines to guard against mild disease and infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are likely staying effective against variants because of the broad immune response they cause, which means that virus changes or mutations are unlikely to make vaccines completely ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO continues to constantly review the evidence and will update its guidance as we find out more. For the latest updates on what we know about the COVID-19 variants, read our latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/%22&quot;&gt;weekly epidemiological updates&lt;/a&gt; and our explainer on ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-effects-of-virus-variants-on-covid-19-vaccines/%22&quot;&gt;the effects of virus variants on COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways of guarding against new variants is to continue applying tried-and-tested public health measures and rolling out vaccines. All COVID-19 vaccines approved for emergency use listing by WHO have been thoroughly tested and proven to provide a high degree of protection against serious illness and death. As stronger virus variants emerge, it’s important to take your vaccine when it’s your turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/take-your-vaccine.png?sfvrsn=4fe09627_11&amp;amp;Status=Master\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;100\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//vaccine-efficacy-effectiveness-and-protection</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//vaccine-efficacy-effectiveness-and-protection</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 11:01:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Q&amp;A on malaria elimination in China</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;width:640px;height:360px;\&amp;quot;&quot; contenteditable=&quot;\&amp;quot;false\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-sf-disable-link-event=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div sf-youtube-url=&quot;\&amp;quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoCx9ysYu2Q\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;\&amp;quot;1\&amp;quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/embed/OoCx9ysYu2Q?v=OoCx9ysYu2Q&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.who.int&amp;amp;widgetid=3\%22&quot; width=&quot;\&amp;quot;640\&amp;quot;&quot; height=&quot;\&amp;quot;360\&amp;quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is a WHO certification of malaria elimination?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certification of malaria elimination is the official recognition by WHO of a country’s malaria-free status. WHO grants this certification when a country has demonstrated, with rigorous, credible evidence, that the chain of local transmission of\r\n    all human malaria parasites has been interrupted nationwide for at least the past 3 consecutive years, and that a fully functional surveillance and response system that can prevent re-establishment of indigenous transmission is in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The malaria elimination certification process is voluntary and can only be initiated when a country submits an official request to the WHO Director-General. China initiated the process in November 2020 after reporting 4 consecutive years of zero indigenous\r\n    malaria cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What process did WHO follow to verify China’s malaria-free status?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO has an established process for certifying a country’s malaria-free status. The process is explained briefly on this &lt;a target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/teams/global-malaria-programme/elimination/certification-process/%22&quot;&gt;webpage &lt;/a&gt;and in greater detail in the publication &lt;a target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789240005624/%22&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preparing for certification of malaria \r\nelimination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This same process is followed for all countries that request a malaria elimination certification from WHO. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/groups/technical-advisory-group-on-malaria-elimination-and-certification/%22&quot;&gt;Malaria\r\n Elimination Certification Panel &lt;/a&gt;(MECP), an independent WHO advisory body, is tasked with verifying a country’s malaria-free status. After reviewing evidence submitted by countries, analysing independent sources and conducting on-site evaluation\r\n    missions, the panel makes a recommendation to WHO to either certify a country as malaria-free or to postpone certification. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What were the overall impressions of MECP members and their key findings?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MECP evaluation team found that staff at all levels of China’s health system have a sound knowledge of malaria diagnosis and management, reinforced by regular training. They noted that China provides a high quality of care for patients with\r\n    malaria, as well as appropriate treatment regimens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evaluation team found that China has a strong malaria surveillance system capable of reliably detecting imported cases of the disease, together with other measures to reduce the risk of a re-establishment of malaria along its shared border with Myanmar,\r\n    where the disease remains endemic. China’s strong commitment from both the central and provincial governments to maintaining zero malaria cases was also recognized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Which sectors of government – beyond the health sector – contributed to this achievement?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through an agreement signed in 2010, 13 ministries – including those representing health, education, finance, research and science, development, public security, the army, police, commerce, industry and information technology, media and tourism\r\n    – joined forces to end malaria nationwide. Together, they formulated the \&quot;China Malaria Elimination Action Plan (2010-2020)\&quot;, which initiated the national malaria elimination programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We realized that it was necessary to cooperate with all relevant departments and involve the whole of society in order to achieve the malaria goals,” notes He Qinghua, Deputy Director-General of the Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control\r\n    at China’s National Health Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working under the guidance of the provincial, county and township administrators, this multisectoral partnership contributed effectively to the elimination of malaria and will continue to play a critical role in the prevention of re-establishment of malaria\r\n    transmission in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What innovative tools or strategies were critical for China to achieve malaria elimination?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of its 7-decade response to malaria, China has been at the forefront of innovation in new tools and strategies for beating back the disease.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1967, the Chinese Government launched the “523 Project”, a research programme aimed at finding new treatments for malaria. This nation-wide effort, involving more than 500 scientists from 60 institutions, led to the discovery in the 1970s\r\n    of artemisinin – the core compound of ACTs (artemisinin-based combination therapies), the most effective antimalarial drugs used today. In recognition of her contributions to the discovery of artemisinin, Chinese Professor Youyou Tu was awarded\r\n    the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in the 1980s, China was one of the first countries to extensively field test insecticide-treated nets, well before they became a WHO-recommended intervention for malaria control. The use of such nets, mainly in the provinces of Sichuan, Guangdong,\r\n    Henan and Jiangsu, led to substantial reductions in malaria incidence in areas where they were deployed.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, China also created and rolled out a highly effective surveillance strategy. Known as “1-3-7”, the strategy includes strict timelines over the course of 7 days to stop malaria in its tracks and prevent onward transmission of\r\n    the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What were some of the other key elements behind China’s success story?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underpinning China’s malaria elimination success was an unwavering political commitment, at all levels of government, to ending the disease over a 70-year period. China’s first malaria control strategy, issued in 1951, noted that Government\r\n    should consider malaria control a “central task” of its administration, and that it should do all it could to reduce the country’s burden of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1956, the goal of national malaria elimination was included in the country’s agriculture and development strategies. By 1957, malaria control stations had been established in 70 counties and cities and pilot malaria control programmes were conducted\r\n    in some provinces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country’s poverty reduction programme, which resulted in significant improvements in housing, living conditions, communications and access to health facilities, also played an important role in this story, particularly in rural areas. The programme\r\n    was launched when the People’s Republic of China was founded in 1949, and further expanded in the late 1970s. Efforts to accelerate poverty reduction have intensified in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China’s commitment to universal health coverage has also been key to success. The country provides a basic public health service package for its residents free of charge; as part of this package, everyone has access to affordable services for the\r\n    diagnosis and treatment of malaria, regardless of legal or financial status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As stated in “Strategies of Healthy China 2030”, a document launched by the State Council in 2016, China will continue to improve access to preventive and curative services by reducing out-of-pocket expenditures and through further investment\r\n    in public health services as well as the strengthening of health personnel training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In recent years, why has Yunnan Province in south-western China been disproportionately affected by malaria?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When China announced a national policy to eliminate malaria in 2010, Yunnan Province had the greatest number of counties considered at risk for the disease. The province offers fertile breeding grounds for mosquitoes during the rainy season and is home\r\n    to a number of species of the mosquito that are vectors for malaria parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yunnan Province also shares a border with 3 malaria-endemic countries: Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam. Myanmar, in particular, carries a substantial malaria burden; during the period 2011-2019, Myanmar was the source of more\r\n    imported malaria cases in China (nearly 5000) than any other country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, under the leadership of the National Health Commission and the Yunnan provincial government, the Yunnan Institute for Parasitic Diseases has worked successfully with the local Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention to\r\n    stamp out indigenous cases of the disease across the province.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What cross-border efforts have been put in place to prevent re-establishment of the disease?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although China has eliminated malaria, the risk of imported cases of the disease remains a key concern, particularly in southern Yunnan Province. To prevent re-establishment of the disease, the country has stepped up its malaria surveillance in at-risk\r\n    zones and has engaged actively in regional malaria control initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At border crossing points to neighbouring countries where malaria is still present, advocacy boards or banners are put up to warn people of the risk of malaria, and leaflets concerning malaria, dengue and other infectious diseases have been made widely\r\n    available. Information on malaria is included in the curriculum of school children, especially in border provinces such as Yunnan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through cross-government agreements, health professionals in China have also collaborated with neighbouring countries to expand support to communities living on the other side of border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China also faces the challenge of imported malaria cases among Chinese nationals returning from sub-Saharan Africa and other malaria-endemic regions. The country’s primary strategy against imported malaria is the maintenance of an effective surveillance\r\n    system that allows for early detection of cases and an appropriate response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How did WHO support China’s malaria elimination effort?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2017, WHO has supported a group of 21 malaria-eliminating countries, including China, through a special initiative called the “E-2020”. A\r\n    &lt;a target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789240024359/%22&quot;&gt;recent report&lt;/a&gt;,\r\n published in April 2021, charts their progress towards a common goal: eliminating malaria within the 2020 timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To guide countries in their elimination journeys, WHO developed the 2017\r\n    &lt;a target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789241511988/%22&quot;&gt; &lt;em&gt;Framework for malaria elimination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,\r\n which outlines the critical requirements needed to achieve and maintain elimination, such as national case-based surveillance systems, quality data management, and robust human and financial resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Framework introduced, for the first time, the concept of verification of subnational malaria elimination, which is particularly relevant for large countries like Brazil, China and Mexico. It also offers guidance on setting targets and systems to verify\r\n    malaria-free areas within a country’s borders, which can help countries prepare for national certification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prepare for its certification, China initiated in 2017 a subnational process whereby individual provinces were verified by the Government as malaria-free. By 2020, all 24 provinces and autonomous regions&amp;nbsp;that were previously malaria endemic  had received national recognition of malaria\r\n    elimination.\r\n    &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//q-a-on-malaria-elimination-in-china</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//q-a-on-malaria-elimination-in-china</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>PAHO paving the way for COVID-19 vaccination in the Americas</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Following decades of positive experience in forecasting and procuring vaccines and supplies from the Revolving Fund, The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) aligned with WHO and its partners to implement the COVAX Facility in the Americas. The COVID-19\r\n    pandemic represented an unprecedented challenge, and COVAX was the best way for PAHO’s Member States to access safe and effective doses equitably. COVAX doses arrived in Latin America in the first week of March 2021, only two months after high-income\r\n    countries received and applied the first COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 has affected every country, and the beginning of the vaccine rollout has seen countries organizing mass vaccination campaigns. But this is nothing new for the Americas region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;\&amp;quot;800\&amp;quot;&quot; height=&quot;\&amp;quot;450\&amp;quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rs2VVBJLats/%22&quot; title=&quot;\&amp;quot;YouTube&quot; video=&quot;&quot; player\&quot;=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;&quot; allow=&quot;\&amp;quot;accelerometer;&quot; autoplay;=&quot;&quot; clipboard-write;=&quot;&quot; encrypted-media;=&quot;&quot; gyroscope;=&quot;&quot; picture-in-picture\&quot;=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For four decades the Americas has been a world leader in routine vaccination, vaccine introduction and implementation of mass vaccination campaigns against infectious diseases. The PAHO Revolving Fund – acting on its principles of solidarity and\r\n    Pan-Americanism, equity, quality and transparency – has been working with its Member States to ensure access to vaccines to reach its immunization goals, helping the countries of the Americas to protect people against some of the world&#39;s worst\r\n    diseases such as polio, smallpox and measles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Revolving Fund has been key in understanding, collecting and forecasting demand for vaccines. The relationships built through the Revolving Fund and in-country PAHO offices have contributed to national immunization programs now being an integrated\r\n    part of the health systems in the Americas, unlike other regions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Americas is a trailblazer in the introduction of new vaccines, like those against HPV and rotavirus. The political commitment from PAHO Member States in support of immunization has been critical to its success, as has the tireless dedication of health\r\n    care workers who go the extra mile to ensure that every person in every corner of the region is reached by immunization services.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Americas was the first region in the world to eliminate rubella, congenital rubella syndrome and measles; to eradicate smallpox; and to be declared polio-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/departments/department-of-communications/features/paho-paving-the-way-for-covid-19-vaccination-in-the-americas/who_a_009342-.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=856c5a28_31\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;Schoolchildren&quot; march=&quot;&quot; through=&quot;&quot; the=&quot;&quot; streets\&quot;=&quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;1044688\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;School children march through the streets of Mexico on National Vaccination Day, 15 March 1986 carrying banners in favour of polio immunization. © WHO / Liba Taylor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1987 and 2010, measles elimination efforts led to the implementation of 157 national vaccination campaigns, vaccinating a total of 440 million people of all ages. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean now vaccinate 100 million adults and\r\n    children annually against seasonal flu. The region has extensive experience in adult vaccination and in prioritizing at-risk groups for COVID-19 vaccination such as older adults, health care workers and people with chronic conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Americas — particularly Latin America and the Caribbean — have been hit harder than any other region by COVID-19, with over 1.8 million deaths and more than 69.7 million cases by June 2021. PAHO has operated as Member States’ first\r\n    port of call on all vaccine matters, regardless of whether they have joined the COVAX Facility through the Revolving Fund.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many steps to complete before vaccine doses can be administered in any particular country. PAHO has worked with Member States every step of the way to facilitate transparency and efficiency, enabling equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and\r\n    supporting countries in their preparedness efforts. As vaccine doses become available, countries are ready to receive them and begin equitable distribution immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/departments/department-of-communications/features/paho-paving-the-way-for-covid-19-vaccination-in-the-americas/who_20210315_col_089_1.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=e3a05565_20\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;A&quot; “pop-up\&quot;=&quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;329977\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fabian Mauricio Niño Terraza, coordinator of the vaccination site, talks to PAHO/WHO Advisor in Family, Gender and Life Course Dr Ivy Lorena Talavera at a “pop-up\&quot; COVID-19 vaccination site in the indigenous community of Concordia, Colombia on 16 March 2021. © WHO / Blink Media - Nadège Masseurs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAHO is working with Member States on vaccine procurement in a variety of ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assisting countries in understanding and preparing to meet the COVAX requirements, including financial, legal, programmatic, regulatory, among others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Updating countries about market dynamics and financial projections to estimate their investment in COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Forecasting and securing supplies related to vaccine administration, such as syringes and safety boxes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensuring that routine immunization programmes are able to continue safely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In those cases where bridge funding is required to access COVID-19 vaccine doses in a timely manner, the Revolving Fund is working with countries to extend financial credits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Channelling down payments to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, for countries with administrative restrictions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;International bidding and joint tender with UNICEF, establishing long-term agreements with suppliers to issue price estimates, purchase orders and requisitions in record time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coordinating and monitoring international logistics for 36 countries in the Americas region.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;As part of the preparations to roll out COVID-19 vaccines, PAHO reviewed countries’ national vaccination and deployment plans, offering feedback and technical assistance in areas such as planning and coordination, cold chain, costing and funding,\r\n    identifying target populations, demand generation and risk communications, delivery strategies and vaccine safety monitoring. This support has continued as countries receive shipments of vaccine doses and begin their rollouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/departments/department-of-communications/features/paho-paving-the-way-for-covid-19-vaccination-in-the-americas/who_20210306_tto_094.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=9bbfdadb_21\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;A&quot; nurse=&quot;&quot; administers=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; covid-19=&quot;&quot; vaccine\&quot;=&quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;1876150\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rajwantee Lutchman, a registered nurse, administers COVID-19 vaccine to the recipient as part of a vaccination drill conducted on 6 March 2021 at the Siparia District Health Facility in Trinidad and Tobago. © WHO / Blink Media - Kibwe Brathwaite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that the Americas will require vaccination of nearly one billion people in order to stop the spread of the virus. As the COVAX rollout continues and more countries in the region receive shipments of vaccine doses, PAHO will work alongside\r\n    local health authorities, ensuring that every person who is willing and able to be vaccinated receives the required dose.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For over four decades the Americas has been a world leader in routine vaccination and mass vaccination campaigns against infectious diseases. Through PAHO and the COVAX Facility, their efforts will continue throughout the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

Learn more about vaccines – from how they work and how they’re made to ensuring safety and equitable access – in WHO’s &lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines/explainers/%22&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vaccines Explained series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are supported by decades of medical research. They work by preparing the body&#39;s own immune system to recognise and defend against a specific disease. The volume of information available about vaccination can be overwhelming, so it’s important\r\n    to talk through the topic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s normal to have questions about vaccines and want to make the right decision for you and your loved ones. If someone you know – a friend, family member or colleague – asks questions or expresses concern about vaccines, listen to\r\n    them, acknowledge their feelings and offer correct information if you can. Be ready to suggest reputable sources of information if they want to learn more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is focused on discussing COVID-19 vaccines but its core lessons are relevant to other vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to have conversations about vaccination&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Listen with empathy &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Start by listening with empathy to those who have questions around vaccination. Don’t dismiss them, and acknowledge how they’re feeling (without necessarily agreeing, for example “it’s okay to have questions, or want more information\r\n    before getting a vaccine”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccine_01_landscape.jpg?sfvrsn=53b07af_42\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;673235\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Ask open-ended questions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Ask open-ended questions, such as “What have you heard about the COVID vaccines?” or “Why do you feel that way?”. These questions elicit a response other than “yes” or “no” and can help you better understand\r\n    their concerns, and might also assist the other person in working through their thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccine_02_landscape.jpg?sfvrsn=287a3bd6_26\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;1211755\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Share trusted information&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;When you don’t know the answer or if you’re unsure about how to address their concern, offer to help look for information. Asking for their permission might make them more willing to listen to you rather than feeling like you’re pushing\r\n    unwanted information on them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;You can visit the WHO website to find answers to common questions on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-what-is-vaccination/%22&quot;&gt;vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-marked=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-marked=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;COVID-19 vaccine safety&lt;/a&gt;. You can also check your local health department website or consult with other trusted and expert sources such as your doctor or nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccine_03_landscape.jpg?sfvrsn=65c4d4a6_26\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;881949\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Explore reasons for wanting to get vaccinated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;When discussing vaccination, nothing works as well as getting personal. Share your own reasons for wanting to get vaccinated and, if you’re in a position to, your experience of vaccination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Talk to them about how getting vaccinated against COVID-19 could offer a path back to normalcy. Explain the benefits of vaccination, whether it’s being able to visit family and friends again, return to the office, get children back to school, spend\r\n    time with classmates or other interactions and activities that have been strained because of COVID-19. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;If you previously had concerns that you worked through, and ended up getting vaccinated against COVID-19, share what helped reassure you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Describe how vaccination will help protect you, your family and your community and bring back the activities and pleasures of life that we’ve gone without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccine_04_landscape88a6ab81-ce8e-47cb-a6c6-b9bf54df5d16.jpg?sfvrsn=a4d56d3e_5\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;1532577\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How organizations and vaccinators can help boost vaccine confidence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A range of organizations within and beyond the health sector can play a vital role in sharing accurate information about vaccination and its benefits. Almost everyone can play their part by knowing the basics of vaccination and the reliable sources for\r\n    more details, as well as by openly expressing their enthusiasm for getting vaccinated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Lead by example&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Organizations and employers can boost confidence by openly sharing their support for vaccination, or personal experience of getting vaccinated. This helps to promote vaccination acceptance as a social norm in the workplace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Build trust&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re helping to give vaccines, be supportive of anyone coming in for vaccination who has questions or asks for your advice. Listen to any concerns and communicate in a way that is respectful and builds trust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Vaccines are safe, effective and an important part of the COVID-19 response – but stopping the spread of disease remains key. Remind people that they should keep &amp;nbsp;taking other precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping\r\n    rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Break down barriers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Getting vaccinated often depends on whether or not it’s convenient to do so. To help make vaccination as easy as possible, employers can pay for childcare or the travel costs of getting to vaccination facilities, or offer paid time off for their\r\n    employees to get vaccinated. It’s important to give employees the time and flexibility they need to attend vaccination appointments, and even recover from vaccination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, local civil society organizations and community groups can help people to make vaccination appointments, organize transport or offer any other assistance that might help make it easy for someone to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conversations go a long way in sustaining vaccine confidence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to address people’s concerns about getting vaccinated is to refer them to someone they trust. Remember that these concerns can be emotional for people and touch on issues outside of science, such as their personal experiences\r\n    and their perceptions of poor or unfair treatment in the past. Don’t overwhelm people with facts and information. Instead, acknowledge their perspectives or experiences&amp;nbsp; and speak to their motivations, not what you think they need to hear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination will help keep you, your family and your community safe from COVID-19, and will bring us all closer to doing the things we love with the people we care about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By having thoughtful and kind conversations with people about vaccines and vaccination, you’re making a significant contribution to public health – thank you! &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Further Reading:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-list=&quot;\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;&quot;

This is because your immune system is instructing your body to react in certain ways: it increases blood flow so more immune cells can circulate, and it raises your body temperature in order to kill the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;\&amp;quot;560\&amp;quot;&quot; height=&quot;\&amp;quot;400\&amp;quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/embed/xn0pRq84j_M/%22&quot; title=&quot;\&amp;quot;YouTube&quot; video=&quot;&quot; player\&quot;=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;&quot; allow=&quot;\&amp;quot;accelerometer;&quot; autoplay;=&quot;&quot; clipboard-write;=&quot;&quot; encrypted-media;=&quot;&quot; gyroscope;=&quot;&quot; picture-in-picture\&quot;=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mild-to-moderate side effects, like a low-grade fever or muscle aches, are normal and not a cause for alarm: they are signs that the body’s immune system is responding to the vaccine, specifically the antigen (a substance that triggers an immune\r\n    response), and is gearing up to fight the virus. These side effects usually go away on their own after a few days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common and mild or moderate side effects are a good thing: they show us that the vaccine is working. Experiencing no side effects doesn’t mean the vaccine is ineffective. It means everybody responds differently.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Common side effects of COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any vaccine, COVID-19 vaccines can cause side effects, most of which are mild or moderate and go away within a few days on their own. As shown in the results of clinical trials, more serious or long-lasting side effects are possible. Vaccines are\r\n    continually monitored to detect adverse events.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reported side effects of COVID-19 vaccines have mostly been mild to moderate and have lasted no longer thana few days. Typical side effects include pain at the injection site, fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills and diarrhoea. The chances of\r\n    any of these side effects occurring after vaccination differ according to the specific vaccine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 vaccines protect against the SARS-CoV-2 virus only, so it’s still important to keep yourself healthy and well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Less common side effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon receiving the vaccine, a person should be requested to stay for 15–30 minutes at the vaccination site so health workers are available in case of any immediate reactions. Individuals should alert their local health providers following vaccination\r\n    if they experience any unexpected side effects or other health events – such as side effects lasting more than three days. Less common side effects reported for some COVID-19 vaccines have included severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis;\r\n    however, this reaction is extremely rare.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National authorities and international bodies, including WHO, are closely monitoring for any unexpected side effects following COVID-19 vaccine use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Long-term side effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side effects usually occur within the first few days of getting a vaccine. Since the first mass vaccination programme started in early December 2020, hundreds of millions of vaccine doses have been administered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been concerns about COVID-19 vaccines making people sick with COVID-19. But none of the approved vaccines contain the live virus that causes COVID-19, which means that COVID-19 vaccines cannot make you sick with COVID-19.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After vaccination, it usually takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. So it’s possible a person could be infected with SARS-CoV-2 just before or after vaccination and still get sick with\r\n    COVID-19. This is because the vaccine has not yet had enough time to provide protection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiencing side effects after getting vaccinated means the vaccine is working and your immune system is responding as it should. Vaccines are safe, and getting vaccinated will help protect you against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//side-effects-of-covid-19-vaccines</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//side-effects-of-covid-19-vaccines</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2021 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines</title><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-list=&quot;\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;&quot; data-level=&quot;\&amp;quot;1\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution.

Vaccine safety is one of WHO’s highest priorities, and we’re working closely with national authorities to develop and implement standards\r\n    to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ensuring safety&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billions of people have been safely vaccinated against COVID-19. All of the approved COVID-19 vaccines have been carefully tested and continue to be monitored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines go through a rigorous, multi-stage testing process, including large clinical trials that involve tens of thousands of people. These trials are specifically designed to identify any safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/groups/strategic-advisory-group-of-experts-on-immunization/covid-19-materials/%22&quot;&gt;An external panel of experts&lt;/a&gt; convened by\r\n    WHO analyses the results from clinical trials and recommends whether and how the vaccines should be used.

The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgNL_9ktUmY&amp;amp;list=PL9S6xGsoqIBXHSDMCp8CjOmhULeQnJ_7J&amp;amp;index=10\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;mRNA vaccine technology&lt;/a&gt; has been studied for over a decade, including in the development of vaccines for Zika, rabies and influenza.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mRNA vaccines have been rigorously assessed for safety, and clinical trials have shown that they provide a long-lasting immune response. mRNA vaccines are not live virus vaccines and do not interfere with human DNA. For more information on mRNA\r\n    vaccines, see WHO’s explainer on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-race-for-a-covid-19-vaccine-explained/%22&quot;&gt;different types of COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Safety of COVID-19 vaccines for different groups&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 vaccines have been tested in large, randomized controlled trials that include people of a broad age range, all sexes, different ethnicities, and those with known medical conditions. The vaccines have shown a high level of efficacy across all\r\n    populations.\r\n    &lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Vaccines have been found to be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8Remuje4bs&amp;amp;list=PL9S6xGsoqIBXHSDMCp8CjOmhULeQnJ_7J&amp;amp;index=8\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;safe and effective in people with various underlying medical conditions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt; that are associated with increased risk of severe disease. These include high blood pressure; diabetes; asthma; pulmonary, liver or kidney disease; and chronic infections that are stable and controlled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who should consult with a doctor before vaccination include people with a compromised immune system, older people with severe frailty, people with a history of severe allergic reaction to vaccines, people living with HIV, and those who are pregnant\r\n    or breastfeeding. For more information about vaccine safety for different groups, please see our Q&amp;amp;A on COVID-19 vaccine safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Pregnancy&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;You can get vaccinated whilst you are pregnant. During pregnancy, you are at higher risk of serious illness caused by COVID-19. You are also at higher risk of delivering your baby prematurely if you contract COVID-19. While there is less data available on vaccination of pregnant people, evidence on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy has been growing, and no safety concerns have been identified. Especially in countries with high transmission, or if you have an occupation where you are at more risk of being exposed to COVID-19, the benefits of getting the vaccine outweigh potential risks. There is no risk of getting COVID-19 from the vaccine. Talk to your healthcare provider to make an informed decision about vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-FAQ-Pregnancy-Vaccines-2022.1/%22&quot;&gt;Questions and Answers: COVID-19 vaccines and pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;font-weight:700;text-align:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Breastfeeding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are breastfeeding, you should get vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as it is your turn. None of the current COVID-19 vaccines have live virus in them. This means there is no risk of you transmitting COVID-19 to your baby through your breastmilk from the vaccine.&amp;nbsp; In fact, the antibodies you get after vaccination may go through your breast milk and help to protect your baby.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Safety of COVID-19 vaccines for children&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer vaccine is safe for use in children aged 5 years and above. For children in this age group, WHO recommends a reduced dosage of 10 µg (0.2 ml). Both Pfizer and Moderna are safe for use in children aged 12 and above using a dose of 0.3 ml and 0.5 ml respectively.&amp;nbsp; However, while the availability of COVID-19 vaccines is limited, WHO recommends that countries should vaccinate children only when high vaccine coverage with two doses has been achieved in higher priority-use groups, as identified in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Prioritization-2023.1/%22&quot;&gt;WHO Prioritization Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;However, children with existing health conditions should be prioritised for vaccination at the same time as other high risk groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine trials to determine whether other COVID-19 vaccines are safe for use in children are ongoing, and WHO recommendations will be updated when the evidence supports a change in the policy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practicing the protective behaviours is still the best way to keep everyone, including children, safe from COVID-19, whether or not you have been vaccinated. Keep a safe distance from others, avoid crowds, wear a well-fitting mask covering your mouth and nose, keep indoor spaces well ventilated, clean hands regularly and cover coughs and sneezes, as well as getting vaccinated as soon as it’s your turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This page was updated on 21 January 2022 to reflect updates in the latest guidance relating to the vaccination of children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//safety-of-covid-19-vaccines</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//safety-of-covid-19-vaccines</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2021 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Getting the COVID-19 Vaccine</title><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-list=&quot;\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;&quot; data-level=&quot;\&amp;quot;1\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution.

After vaccination, the body is ready to fight the virus if it is later exposed to it, thereby preventing\r\n    illness.\r\n    &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, develop an immune response within the first few weeks, but we are still learning how strong and lasting that immune response is, and how it varies between different people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2UUBQSOVDc&amp;amp;list=PL9S6xGsoqIBXHSDMCp8CjOmhULeQnJ_7J&amp;amp;index=10&amp;amp;ab_channel=WorldHealthOrganization%28WHO%29\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;already been infected with SARS-CoV-2 should still get vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; unless told otherwise by their health care provider. Even if you’ve had a previous infection, the vaccine acts as a booster that strengthens the immune response. There have also been some instances of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 a second\r\n    time, which makes getting vaccinated even more important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-explained_topic-9_getting-vaccinated_immunity.jpg?sfvrsn=8ce6d69b_34\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;470767\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What to expect during vaccination&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical professionals can best advise individuals on whether or not, and when, they should receive a vaccine. A health worker will administer the vaccine, and the person receiving it will be asked to wait for 15–30 minutes before leaving the vaccination\r\n    site. This is so that health workers can observe individuals for any unexpected reactions following vaccination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any vaccine, COVID-19 vaccines can cause mild-to-moderate side effects, such as a low-grade fever or pain or redness at the injection site. These should go away on their own within a few days.

Scientists call this priming the immune response. The second dose acts\r\n    as a booster, ensuring the immune system develops a memory response to fight off the virus if it encounters it again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the urgent need for a COVID-19 vaccine, initial clinical trials of vaccine candidates were performed with the shortest possible duration between doses. Therefore an interval of 21–28 days (3–4 weeks) between doses is recommended\r\n    by WHO. Depending on the vaccine, the interval may be extended for up to 42 days – or even up to 12 weeks for some vaccines – on the basis of current evidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many COVID-19 vaccines being developed and produced by different manufacturers around the world. WHO recommends that a vaccine from the same manufacturer be used for both doses if you require two doses. This recommendation may be updated as\r\n    further information becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Safety against infection and transmission after vaccination&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available clinical trials have shown COVID-19 vaccines to be safe and highly effective at preventing severe disease. Given how new COVID-19 is, researchers are still looking into how long a vaccinated person is likely to be protected from infection, and\r\n    whether vaccinated people can still transmit the virus to others. As the vaccine rollout expands, WHO will continue to monitor the data alongside regulatory authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/maskwearing_landscape_en.jpg?sfvrsn=f38fd78e_31\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;458672\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safe and effective vaccines are making a significant contribution to preventing severe disease and death from COVID-19. As vaccines are rolling out and immunity is building, it is important to continue to follow all of the recommended measures that reduce\r\n    the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This includes physically distancing yourself from others; wearing a mask, especially in crowded and poorly ventilated settings; cleaning your hands frequently; covering any cough or sneeze in your bent elbow; and opening\r\n    windows when indoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//getting-the-covid-19-vaccine</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//getting-the-covid-19-vaccine</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2021 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>WHO advises that ivermectin only be used to treat COVID-19 within clinical trials</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The current evidence on the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 patients is inconclusive. Until more data is available, WHO recommends that the drug only be used within clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This recommendation, which applies to patients with COVID-19 of any disease severity, is now part of WHO’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/therapeutics-and-covid-19-living-guideline/%22&quot;&gt;guidelines on COVID-19 treatments&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ivermectin is a broad spectrum anti-parasitic agent, included in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://list.essentialmeds.org/medicines/58/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;WHO essential medicines list&lt;/a&gt; for several parasitic diseases.

It is also used to treat scabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A guideline development group was convened in response to the increased international attention on ivermectin as a potential treatment for COVID-19. This group is an independent, international panel of experts, which includes clinical care experts in multiple specialties and also include an ethicist and patient-partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group reviewed pooled data from 16 randomized controlled trials (total enrolled 2407), including both inpatients and outpatients with COVID-19. They determined that the evidence on whether ivermectin reduces mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, need for hospital admission and time to clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients is of “very low certainty,” due to the small sizes and methodological limitations of available trial data, including small number of events.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel did not look at the use of ivermectin to prevent COVID-19, which is outside of scope of the current guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;text-decoration:underline;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Note to the editor:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous recommendations on the use of therapeutics for COVID-19:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong recommendation for the use systemic &lt;strong&gt;corticosteroids&lt;/strong&gt; for severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients; with a conditional recommendation against their use in patients with mild/moderate COVID-19&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conditional recommendation against administering &lt;strong&gt;remdesivir&lt;/strong&gt; in addition to usual care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong recommendation against the use of &lt;strong&gt;hydroxychloroquine&lt;/strong&gt; or chloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 of any severity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong recommendation against administering &lt;strong&gt;lopinavir/ritonavir&lt;/strong&gt; for treatment of COVID-19 of any severity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conditional recommendation for the use of low dose &lt;strong&gt;anticoagulants&lt;/strong&gt; in hospitalized patients (this recommendation is part of the  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cms.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-clinical-2021-1/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-marked=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;clinical management guidelines&lt;/a&gt;).

Being a refugee hasn’t made her life easier. Until recently, Aseel used a stroller as a makeshift wheelchair and struggled to get around and stay engaged in the classroom because the stroller hurt her back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to WHO’s work on globalizing wheelchair guidelines, and UNICEF’s disability-focused programmes, a wheelchair of appropriate size and design was provided to Aseel to help her be included in school activities and move around more easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Aseel, many people in the world today lack access to appropriate assistive technology. WHO estimates that out of the one billion people needing at least one assistive product, nine in ten go without. Children with injuries living in low- and middle-income or fragile countries mostly depend on donated wheelchairs, which are often of poor quality and inappropriate for the user or their environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The barriers are manifold, but mostly they have to do with the cost and availability of assistive products, the lack of harmonized specifications, broken supply systems, and the fact that society is still not as inclusive of persons with disabilities as it needs to be. The result for many people in low- and middle-income countries: either no access or only access to low-quality, inappropriate products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new global guide to expand access to quality assistive products &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address some of those barriers, WHO has created the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/339851/9789240020283-eng.pdf/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Assistive Products Specifications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(APS) a guidebook with specs for 26 prioritized assistive products that describes the minimum quality requirements for manufacturing. Funded by UK Aid under Global Disability Innovation Hub’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://at2030.org//%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;AT2030&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;programme, the APS supports a focus on innovative products, new service models, and global capacity to drive disability innovation for a fairer world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This first compilation of the APS includes products selected from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/207694/WHO_EMP_PHI_2016.01_eng.pdf?sequence=1\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Priority assistive products list&lt;/a&gt; and covers mobility, hearing, vision, communication, cognition and self-care. The products range from clubfoot braces and wheelchairs to hearing aids, alarm signalers and audio-players. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main aim of the APS is to ensure countries get supply of good quality and affordable assistive products for all who need them. Each APS in the compilation describes the functional and performance requirements that can be used as a model to guide manufacturing and procurement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, WHO and UNICEF will issue a joint tender for wheelchair and hearing aids and will ensure the products reach those who need them. The two agencies have already identified and are working with assistive technology manufacturers to ensure the specs are followed and that production and supply can be cost-effective for both bulk buyers and individuals. Both organizations will also support countries with training to adapt their national standards to improve access to quality, life-changing health products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appropriate assistive technology can have a direct impact on the well-being of children and adults of all ages by supporting their functionality and inclusion into society, thereby increasing the opportunities for education, employment and social engagement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a proper use of hearing aids leads young children to improved language skills. Or, an appropriate wheelchair - like the one given to Aseel - can increase the chances of people completing their education, finding employment and engaging in social activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The APS is the first global guide for quality-assured assistive products and will be updated on a regular basis. Quality assistive technology for all is the ultimate aim of this guide-book, and improved well-being for millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO work on assistive technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO works to change the landscape of access to assistive technology through a multi-pronged approach based on human rights, universal health coverage and the realities of low- and middle-income countries. In 2016, it issued the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/207694/WHO_EMP_PHI_2016.01_eng.pdf?sequence=1\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Priority assistive products list&lt;/a&gt;, a compilation of the 50 most essential assistive products, selected based on a survey done with persons living with disabilities and their carers. WHO has been active in wheelchair provision since 2004 and introduced the Wheelchair Guidelines, training and wheelchair provision standards.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNICEF work on assistive technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNICEF focuses on three key activities to ensure disability-inclusive supplies are available and accessible worldwide. First, the organization is analyzing and updating its products in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://supply.unicef.org//%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;UNICEF Supply Catalogue&lt;/a&gt; to ensure they are disability-friendly. Second, UNICEF is introducing new assistive technology to programmes worldwide, such as the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.unicef.org/supply/stories/inclusive-innovation-transforms-standard-latrine-disability-friendly-solution/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;disability-friendly latrine&lt;/a&gt;. This work involves collaborating with WHO and partners to develop guidance for AT suppliers who produce products and humanitarian staff who procure the products. Finally, UNICEF is increasing advocacy efforts to gain a global consensus for assistive technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO-UNICEF Joint Action Plan on Assistive Technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve access to assistive technology for everyone, everywhere, on 28 July 2020, WHO and UNICEF signed a Joint Action Plan on Assistive Technology and included provision of assistive products under the Strategic Collaboration Framework between The World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund to bring a catalytic impact and provide quality assistive products to the 900 million people that are lacking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK Aid’s AT2030 led by Global Disability Innovation Hub (GDI Hub) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT2030 tests ‘what works’ to improve access to AT and support solutions to scale. With a focus on innovative products, new service models, and global capacity support, the programme aims to reach 9 million people directly and 6 million more indirectly to enable a lifetime of potential through life-changing assistive technology. GDI Hub is a research and practice centre driving disability innovation for a fairer world. Operational in 35 countries, the GDI Hub develops bold approaches, partnerships and ecosystems to accelerate change.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://at2030.org//%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;https://at2030.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//first-ever-global-guide-for-assistive-technology-to-improve-the-life-of-millions</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//first-ever-global-guide-for-assistive-technology-to-improve-the-life-of-millions</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The effects of virus variants on COVID-19 vaccines</title><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution. Learn more about vaccines – from how they work and how they’re made to ensuring safety and equitable access – in WHO’s &lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines/explainers/%22&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vaccines Explained series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All viruses – including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 – evolve over time. When a virus replicates or makes copies of itself, it sometimes changes a little bit, which is normal for a virus. These changes are called “mutations”.\r\n    A virus with one or more new mutations is referred to as a “variant” of the original virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes a virus to change to a new variant?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a virus is widely circulating in a population and causing many infections, the likelihood of the virus mutating increases. The more opportunities a virus has to spread, the more it replicates – and the more opportunities it has to undergo changes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; contenteditable=&quot;\&amp;quot;false\&amp;quot;&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;width:560px;height:315px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-sf-disable-link-event=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;\&amp;quot;560\&amp;quot;&quot; height=&quot;\&amp;quot;315\&amp;quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/embed/qD8dAbov5JU/%22&quot; frameborder=&quot;\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most viral mutations have little to no impact on the virus’s ability to cause infections and disease. But depending on where the changes are located in the virus’s genetic material, they may affect a virus’s properties, such as transmission\r\n    (for example, it may spread more or less easily) or severity (for example, it may cause more or less severe disease).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What impact do the new variants of the COVID-19 virus have on vaccines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 vaccines that are currently in development or have been approved are expected to provide at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1351587623920410624?s=20\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;some protection against new virus variants&lt;/a&gt; because\r\n    these vaccines elicit a broad immune response involving a range of antibodies and cells. Therefore, changes or mutations in the virus should not make vaccines completely ineffective. In the event that any of these vaccines prove to be less effective\r\n    against one or more variants, it will be possible to change the composition of the vaccines to protect against these variants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data continues to be collected and analysed on new variants of the COVID-19 virus. WHO is working with researchers, health officials and scientists to understand how these variants affect the virus’s behaviour, including their impact on\r\n    the effectiveness of vaccines, if any. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/disease/novel_coronavirus/en//%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-marked=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;WHO’s Disease Outbreak News&lt;/a&gt; to get up-to-date information on the impact of COVID-19\r\n    virus variants on the effectiveness of the different vaccines. This is an area where the evidence remains preliminary and is developing quickly.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we are learning more,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/science-in-5/episode-20---covid-19---variants-vaccines/%22&quot;&gt; we need to do everything possible to stop the spread of the virus in order to prevent mutations that may reduce the efficacy of existing vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.\r\n In addition, manufacturers and the programmes using the vaccines may have to adjust to the evolution of the COVID-19 virus: for example, vaccines may need to incorporate more than one strain when in development, booster shots may be required, and\r\n    other vaccine changes may be needed. Trials must also be designed and maintained to allow any changes in efficacy to be assessed, and must be of sufficient scale and diversity to enable clear interpretation of results. Studies of the impact of vaccines\r\n    as they are deployed are also essential in order to understand their impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is WHO doing to monitor and understand the impact of virus variants on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO has been tracking mutations and variants since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our global SARS-CoV-2 laboratory network includes a dedicated Virus Evolution Working Group, which aims to detect new changes quickly and assess their possible impact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research groups have carried out genomic sequencing of the COVID-19 virus and shared these sequences on public databases, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.gisaid.org//%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;GISAID&lt;/a&gt;. This global collaboration allows scientists to better\r\n    track how the virus is changing. WHO recommends that all countries increase the sequencing of the COVID-19 virus where possible and share data to help one another monitor and respond to the evolving pandemic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO has also established a SARS-CoV-2 Risk Monitoring and Evaluation Framework to identify, monitor and assess variants of concern. It will involve components like surveillance, research on variants of concern, and evaluation of the impact on diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.\r\n    The framework will serve as a guide for manufacturers and countries on changes that may be needed for COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can we prevent future new variants of the COVID-19 virus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9COT-kR6NFA&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;ab_channel=WorldHealthOrganization%28WHO%29\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Stopping the spread at the source remains key.&lt;/a&gt; Current measures to reduce transmission – including\r\n    frequent hand washing, wearing a mask, physical distancing, good ventilation and avoiding crowded places or closed settings – continue to work against new variants by reducing the amount of viral transmission and therefore also reducing opportunities\r\n    for the virus to mutate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; contenteditable=&quot;\&amp;quot;false\&amp;quot;&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;width:560px;height:315px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-sf-disable-link-event=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;\&amp;quot;560\&amp;quot;&quot; height=&quot;\&amp;quot;315\&amp;quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/embed/01b-74ljqWc/%22&quot; frameborder=&quot;\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scaling up vaccine manufacturing and rolling out vaccines as quickly and widely as possible will also be critical ways of protecting people before they are exposed to the virus and the risk of new variants. Priority should be given to vaccinating high-risk\r\n    groups everywhere to maximize global protection against new variants and minimize the risk of transmission. Moreover, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/feature-stories/detail/access-and-allocation-how-will-there-be-fair-and-equitable-allocation-of-limited-supplies/%22&quot;&gt;ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; is more critical than ever to address\r\n    the evolving pandemic. As more people get vaccinated, we expect virus circulation to decrease, which will then lead to fewer mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; contenteditable=&quot;\&amp;quot;false\&amp;quot;&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;width:560px;height:315px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-sf-disable-link-event=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;\&amp;quot;560\&amp;quot;&quot; height=&quot;\&amp;quot;315\&amp;quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/embed/xLvY210yQkE/%22&quot; frameborder=&quot;\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is it important to get vaccinated even if there are new variants of the virus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are a critical tool in the battle against COVID-19, and there are clear public health and lifesaving benefits to using the tools we already have. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV2JF2jfpiY&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;ab_channel=WorldHealthOrganization%28WHO%29\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;We must not put off getting vaccinated because of our concerns about new variants,&lt;/a&gt; and we must proceed with vaccination even if the vaccines may be somewhat less effective against some of the COVID-19 virus variants.

The NDVP serves as the “one-country plan” and main framework for a country’s vaccine introduction and vaccination efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NDVP outlines key aspects of readiness, including:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-list=&quot;\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;&quot; data-level=&quot;\&amp;quot;1\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory preparedness:&lt;/strong&gt; legal requirements for importing vaccines, regulatory authorization for using vaccines, and procedures to expedite vaccine availability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning and coordination:&lt;/strong&gt; governance and management structure at both country (such as a national coordinating committee and national immunization technical advisory groups) and subnational levels to oversee the deployment, implementation and monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costing and funding:&lt;/strong&gt; a realistic budget – including funding sources and budget gaps – for vaccine deployment and vaccination&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target populations and vaccination strategies:&lt;/strong&gt; order of priority for different population groups to receive vaccination and how each group will be vaccinated&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply chain and health care waste management:&lt;/strong&gt; critical supply chain activities to prepare for vaccine deployment (such as cold chain assessment and secure distribution and logistics) and to ensure safe handling of health care waste&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human resources management and training:&lt;/strong&gt; staff requirements for the vaccine rollout and a plan for training and supervision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccine acceptance and demand:&lt;/strong&gt; an integrated approach to achieve high uptake of COVID-19 vaccines, including strategic communication activities that promote vaccination, manage misinformation and convey risk in the event of any adverse effects&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccine safety:&lt;/strong&gt; steps to prepare for, monitor and address vaccine safety and potential adverse events and ensure injection safety&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immunization monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt; a strategy for collection and reporting of immunization data, disease surveillance to monitor vaccine impact, and evaluation of the overall implementation process&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each country’s NDVP should be developed through a consultative process, led by the country’s Ministry of Health and supported by other organizations, including WHO, UNICEF and other relevant partners, to fine-tune the plan until it is complete. The Country Readiness and Delivery workstream of the ACT Accelerator has issued   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cms.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccine_deployment-2020.1/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-marked=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;guidance on developing a national deployment and vaccination plan for COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, which helps countries produce their plan for COVID-19 vaccine introduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why should countries develop a National Deployment and Vaccination Plan?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing an NDVP helps countries prepare for COVID-19 vaccination, identify resource needs and streamline the process for introducing vaccines. Once an NDVP is developed, countries work on its implementation, including the detailed planning of&amp;nbsp; vaccine delivery strategies, logistics, HR and funding mobilization.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How will country readiness be assessed?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A review process has been set up to provide support and feedback to countries for improving and finalizing their plans. This ensures that a country’s NDVP includes the necessary elements to rapidly deploy vaccines and implement COVID-19 vaccination, and that any recommendations for improvement are addressed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once an AMC92 participant submits its NDVP, a Regional Review Committee (RRC) assesses the plan and evaluates country preparedness and capacity for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/m/item/allocation-mechanism-for-covax-facility-vaccines-explainer/%22&quot;&gt;vaccine allocation&lt;/a&gt;, deployment and administration. Those participants with an NDVP that meets the standardized readiness assessment join the process for allocating COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX Facility. Countries should take into account the recommendations from the review to further improve their preparedness for vaccine introduction.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//country-readiness-for-covid-19-vaccines</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//country-readiness-for-covid-19-vaccines</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>WHO recommends follow-up care, low-dose anticoagulants for COVID-19 patients</title><description>&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends that patients who have COVID-19 - both confirmed and suspected - should have access to follow-up care if they have persistent, new or changing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one of the recommendations made by WHO in revised clinical management guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence was gathered on the post COVID condition, so-called ‘long COVID’, where people who have recovered from COVID-19 continue to have longer-term issues like extreme fatigue, persistent cough and exercise intolerance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding this condition is one of WHO’s priority areas of work. In February 2021, WHO will organize a series of consultations to reach consensus on a description of this condition and its subtypes, and case definitions. This scientific understanding\r\n    will inform the name of the condition. The consultations will include a broad range of stakeholders, including patient groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For COVID-19 patients at home, WHO suggests the use of pulse oximetry to measure oxygen levels in the blood. This needs to be coordinated with other aspects of home care, such as education for the patient and care provider and regular follow-up of the\r\n    patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For hospitalized patients, WHO suggests the use of low dose anticoagulants for preventing the blood clots forming in blood vessels (thrombosis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For hospitalized patients who are taking supplemental oxygen (including high-flow nasal oxygen) or non-invasive ventilation, WHO suggests positioning patients on their stomachs to increase oxygen flow (awake prone positioning).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines also include recommendations on the use of care bundles to systematize care provision for COVID-19 patients, as well as a recommendation to favour clinical judgement over models in making decisions for the patient’s care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommendations were made by an independent panel of experts, the Guideline Development Group, on the basis of detailed rapid reviews of all available evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines are a living document, updated regularly as more data becomes available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//who-recommends-follow-up-care-low-dose-anticoagulants-for-covid-19-patients</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//who-recommends-follow-up-care-low-dose-anticoagulants-for-covid-19-patients</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jan 2021 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The different types of COVID-19 vaccines</title><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution.

Of these, at least 52 candidate vaccines are in human trials. There are several others currently in phase I/II, which will enter phase III in the coming months\r\n        (for more information on the clinical trial phases, see part three of our Vaccine Explained series).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why are there so many vaccines in development?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, many vaccine candidates will be evaluated before any are found to be both safe and effective. For example, of all the vaccines that are studied in the lab and laboratory animals, roughly 7 out of every 100 will be considered good enough\r\n        to move into clinical trials in humans. Of the vaccines that do make it to clinical trials, just one in five is successful. Having lots of different vaccines in development increases the chances that there will be one or more successful vaccines\r\n        that will be shown to be safe and efficacious for the intended prioritized populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-custom-thumbnail=&quot;\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-topics-four-images-working-01.jpg?sfvrsn=fdb5276_37\%22&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-constrain-proportions=&quot;\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;\&amp;quot;600\&amp;quot;&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;Vaccines&quot; topics=&quot;&quot; four=&quot;&quot; images=&quot;&quot; working=&quot;&quot; 01\&quot;=&quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;898037\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The different types of vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three main approaches to designing a vaccine. Their differences lie in whether they use a &lt;strong&gt;whole&lt;/strong&gt; virus or bacterium; just the &lt;strong&gt;parts&lt;/strong&gt; of the germ that triggers the immune system; or just the &lt;strong&gt;genetic material&lt;/strong&gt; that provides the instructions for making specific proteins and not the whole virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-custom-thumbnail=&quot;\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-topics-four-images-working-02.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=d4d31bb1_31\%22&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-constrain-proportions=&quot;\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;\&amp;quot;600\&amp;quot;&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;Vaccines&quot; topics=&quot;&quot; four=&quot;&quot; images=&quot;&quot; working=&quot;&quot; 02\&quot;=&quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;1079883\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The whole-microbe approach&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inactivated vaccine&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first way to make a vaccine is to take the disease-carrying virus or bacterium, or one very similar to it, and inactivate or kill it using chemicals, heat or radiation. This approach uses technology that’s been proven to work in people –\r\n        this is the way the flu and polio vaccines are made – and vaccines can be manufactured on a reasonable scale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it requires special laboratory facilities to grow the virus or bacterium safely, can have a relatively long production time, and will likely require two or three doses to be administered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live-attenuated vaccine &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;A live-attenuated vaccine uses a living but weakened version of the virus or one that’s very similar. The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and the chickenpox and shingles vaccine are examples of this type of vaccine.\r\n        This approach uses similar technology to the inactivated vaccine and can be manufactured at scale. However, vaccines like this may not be suitable for people with compromised immune systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viral vector vaccine &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This type of vaccine uses a safe virus to deliver specific sub-parts – called proteins – of the germ of interest so that it can trigger an immune response without causing disease. To do this, the instructions for making\r\n        particular parts of the pathogen of interest are inserted into a safe virus. The safe virus then serves as a platform or vector to deliver the protein into the body.&amp;nbsp; The protein triggers the immune response. The Ebola vaccine is a viral\r\n        vector vaccine and this type can be developed rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The subunit approach&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-custom-thumbnail=&quot;\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-topics-four-images-working-03.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=d795a4d1_31\%22&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;548291\&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;\&amp;quot;600\&amp;quot;&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;Vaccines&quot; topics=&quot;&quot; four=&quot;&quot; images=&quot;&quot; working=&quot;&quot; 03\&quot;=&quot;&quot; sf-constrain-proportions=&quot;\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A subunit vaccine is one that only uses the very specific parts (the subunits) of a virus or bacterium that the immune system needs to recognize. It doesn&#39;t contain the whole microbe or use a safe virus as a vector. The subunits may be proteins or\r\n        sugars. Most of the vaccines on the childhood schedule are subunit vaccines, protecting people from diseases such as whooping cough, tetanus, diphtheria and meningococcal meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img sf-custom-thumbnail=&quot;\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-topics-four-images-working-04.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=f5f33baa_30\%22&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;493676\&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;\&amp;quot;600\&amp;quot;&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;Vaccines&quot; topics=&quot;&quot; four=&quot;&quot; images=&quot;&quot; working=&quot;&quot; 04\&quot;=&quot;&quot; sf-constrain-proportions=&quot;\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The genetic approach (nucleic acid vaccine)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike vaccine approaches that use either a weakened or dead whole microbe or parts of one, a nucleic acid vaccine just uses a section of genetic material that provides the instructions for specific proteins, not the whole microbe. DNA and RNA are\r\n        the instructions our cells use to make proteins. In our cells, DNA is first turned into messenger RNA, which is then used as the blueprint to make specific proteins.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-custom-thumbnail=&quot;\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-topics-four-images-working-05-dna-rna-v2.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=9a559d78_32\%22&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;430555\&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;\&amp;quot;600\&amp;quot;&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;Vaccines&quot; topics=&quot;&quot; four=&quot;&quot; images=&quot;&quot; working=&quot;&quot; 05=&quot;&quot; dna=&quot;&quot; rna=&quot;&quot; v2\&quot;=&quot;&quot; sf-constrain-proportions=&quot;\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nucleic acid vaccine delivers a specific set of instructions to our cells, either as DNA or mRNA, for them to make the specific protein that we want our immune system to recognize and respond to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:initial;color:#313131;font-size:inherit;font-family:inherit;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;The nucleic acid approach is a new way of developing vaccines.

Work being carried out on potential COVID-19 vaccines follows the same processes as with other vaccines, but given the urgent need to\r\n        stop the pandemic, some of the steps are being carried out in parallel to accelerate the process. The COVAX Facility will accelerate this timeline by enabling early investments in the development of a variety of vaccine candidates; expanding manufacturing\r\n        capacity; and accelerating vaccine production ahead of the licencing process so that vaccines can be deployed without delay once they are proven to be safe and effective.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Core goals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO, as the COVAX lead for allocation, proposes that protecting individuals and health systems and minimizing the impact on economies should be the driving force behind the allocation of COVID-19 health products across different countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/initiatives/act-accelerator/%22&quot;&gt;The ACT-Accelerator&lt;/a&gt; was set up to contain the COVID-19 pandemic faster and more efficiently\r\n        by ensuring that successful diagnostics, vaccines and treatments are shared equitably across all countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to achieving that goal is the design and implementation of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/m/item/fair-allocation-mechanism-for-covid-19-vaccines-through-the-covax-facility/%22&quot;&gt;Fair Allocation Framework.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equitable distribution is particularly important in the area of vaccines, which, if used correctly and equitably, could help to stop the acute phase of the pandemic and allow the rebuilding of our societies and economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/334299/WHO-2019-nCoV-SAGE_Framework-Allocation_and_prioritization-2020.1-eng.pdf?ua=1\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Values Framework for the allocation and prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination&lt;/a&gt; offers high-level guidance globally on the values and ethical considerations regarding the allocation of COVID-19 vaccines between countries and offers guidance nationally on the prioritization of groups for vaccination within countries while\r\n        supply is limited.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prioritized groups&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While resources remain scarce, immunization programmes will have to prioritize certain groups over others before progressively expanding distribution to all population groups. When a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available, to reduce severe disease, deaths\r\n        and protect health systems, it’s important that priority &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccine-access-and-allocation/%22&quot;&gt;groups&lt;/a&gt; receive the vaccine first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The definition of priority groups should be based on the most thorough analysis of evidence, including differences across diverse geographical and social settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These priority groups, at present, as determined by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frontline workers in health and social care settings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People over the age of 65&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People under the age of 65 who have underlying health conditions that put them at a higher risk of death&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase one&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries that are members of the COVAX Facility will have access to enough vaccines to immunize their population’s priority groups. In the first phase of allocation, doses will be made available to participating countries simultaneously until\r\n        they can cover approximately 20% of the population of every country. The first group prioritized would be frontline workers in health and social care settings in most countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-custom-thumbnail=&quot;\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-topics-five-images-01-v2.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=fc67b9e7_37\%22&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-constrain-proportions=&quot;\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;\&amp;quot;600\&amp;quot;&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;Vaccines&quot; topics=&quot;&quot; five=&quot;&quot; images=&quot;&quot; 01=&quot;&quot; v2\&quot;=&quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;773661\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By choosing to set an initial prioritization for health workers (in most countries this is 3% of less of the population), WHO wants to ensure that volumes meet the needs of well-resourced health systems while not penalizing countries with a lower\r\n        proportion of health and social care workers. Additional portions will follow gradually as more supply becomes available until 20% of the national population is covered in all participating countries. For 92 low and middle-income economies, reaching\r\n        20% is contingent upon raising funds for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22http://www.gavi.org/gavi-covax-amc/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;COVAX AMC&lt;/a&gt;, the financing mechanism which will support their participation in the COVAX Facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once countries have been allocated enough doses for 20% of the population, additional doses will be made available depending on funding. In this second phase, the pace at which countries would receive additional doses of vaccine would be determined\r\n        by an assessment of their risk at any given time, if there remains substantial supply limitations. Consideration will be based on an evaluation of threat (the potential impact of COVID-19 on a country, assessed using epidemiological data) and\r\n        vulnerability (the vulnerability of a country, based on health systems and population factors).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-custom-thumbnail=&quot;\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-topics-five-images-02-v2.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=69a2bee9_34\%22&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-constrain-proportions=&quot;\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;\&amp;quot;600\&amp;quot;&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;Vaccines&quot; topics=&quot;&quot; five=&quot;&quot; images=&quot;&quot; 02=&quot;&quot; v2\&quot;=&quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;1129486\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using these criteria, the analysis will identify countries with the highest risk, which will receive vaccines at a faster pace than those considered at lower risk.

They also contain other ingredients to keep the vaccine safe and effective. These latter ingredients are included in most vaccines\r\n            and have been used for decades in billions of doses of vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Each vaccine component serves a specific purpose, and each ingredient is tested in the manufacturing process. All ingredients are tested for safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antigen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;All vaccines contain an active component (the antigen) which generates an immune response, or the blueprint for making the active component. The antigen may be a small part of the disease-causing organism, like a protein or sugar, or it may be\r\n            the whole organism in a weakened or inactive form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img 2=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-topic-two-antigens-static.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=4a6073_70\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;Vaccines&quot; topic=&quot;&quot; 01=&quot;&quot; vaccine=&quot;&quot; antigens\&quot;=&quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;687137\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preservatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Preservatives prevent the vaccine from becoming contaminated once the vial has been opened, if it will be used for vaccinating more than one person. Some vaccines don’t have preservatives because they are stored in one-dose vials and are discarded\r\n        after the single dose is administered. The most commonly used preservative is 2-phenoxyethanol. It has been used for many years in a number of vaccines, is used in a range of baby care products and is safe for use in vaccines, as it has little\r\n        toxicity in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stabilizers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Stabilizers prevent chemical reactions from occurring within the vaccine and keep the vaccine components from sticking to the vaccine vial.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Stabilizers can be sugars (lactose, sucrose), amino acids (glycine), gelatin, and proteins (recombinant human albumin, derived from yeast).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/health-topics/vaccines-ingredients.jpg?sfvrsn=1a2337ab_36&amp;amp;Status=Master\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;Vaccine&quot; ingredients:=&quot;&quot; antigen,=&quot;&quot; adjuvant,=&quot;&quot; preservatives,=&quot;&quot; stabilizers,=&quot;&quot; surfactants,=&quot;&quot; residuals,=&quot;&quot; diluent.\&quot;=&quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;755676\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surfactants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Surfactants keep all the ingredients in the vaccine blended together. They prevent settling and clumping of elements that are in the liquid form of the vaccine. They are also often used in foods like ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Residuals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Residuals are tiny amounts of various substances used during manufacturing or production of vaccines that are not active ingredients in the completed vaccine. Substances will vary depending on the manufacturing process used and may include egg\r\n            proteins, yeast or antibiotics. Residual traces of these substances which may be present in a vaccine are in such small quantities that they need to be measured as parts per million or parts per billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diluent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;A diluent is a liquid used to dilute a vaccine to the correct concentration immediately prior to use. The most commonly used diluent is sterile water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjuvant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Some vaccines also contain adjuvants. An adjuvant improves the immune response to the vaccine, sometimes by keeping the vaccine at the injection site for a little longer or by stimulating local immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;The adjuvant may be a tiny amount of aluminium salts (like aluminium phosphate, aluminium hydroxide or potassium aluminium sulphate). Aluminium has been shown not to cause any long-term health problems, and humans ingest aluminium regularly through\r\n            eating and drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How are vaccines developed?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Most vaccines have been in use for decades, with millions of people receiving them safely every year. As with all medicines, every vaccine must go through extensive and rigorous testing to ensure it is safe before it can be introduced in a country’s\r\n            vaccine programme.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Each vaccine under development must first undergo screenings and evaluations to determine which antigen should be used to invoke an immune response. This preclinical phase is done without testing on humans. An experimental vaccine is first tested\r\n            in animals to evaluate its safety and potential to prevent disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;If the vaccine triggers an immune response, it is then tested in human clinical trials in three phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;The vaccine is given to a small number of volunteers to assess its safety, confirm it generates an immune response, and determine the right dosage.&amp;nbsp;Generally in this phase vaccines are tested in young, healthy adult volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;The vaccine is then given to several hundred volunteers to further assess its safety and ability to generate an immune response. Participants in this phase have the same characteristics (such as age, sex) as the people for whom the vaccine is\r\n            intended. There are usually multiple trials in this phase to evaluate various age groups and different formulations of the vaccine. A group that did not get the vaccine is usually included in phase as a comparator group to determine whether\r\n            the changes in the vaccinated group are attributed to the vaccine, or have happened by chance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;The vaccine is next given to thousands of volunteers – and compared to a similar group of people who didn’t get the vaccine, but received a comparator product – to determine if the vaccine is effective against the disease it\r\n            is designed to protect against and to study its safety in a much larger group of people. Most of the time phase three trials are conducted across multiple countries and multiple sites within a country to assure the findings of the vaccine\r\n            performance apply to many different populations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;During phase two and phase three trials, the volunteers and the scientists conducting the study are shielded from knowing which volunteers had received the vaccine being tested or the comparator product. This is called “blinding” and\r\n            is necessary to assure that neither the volunteers nor the scientists are influenced in their assessment of safety or effectiveness by knowing who got which product. After the trial is over and all the results are finalized, the volunteers\r\n            and the trial scientists are informed who received the vaccine and who received the comparator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img 29=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/topic-two-ciinical-trials-static-29-oct.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=3d4663df_42\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;Topic&quot; two=&quot;&quot; ciinical=&quot;&quot; trials_static=&quot;&quot; oct\&quot;=&quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;866247\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;When the results of all these clinical trials are available, a series of steps is required, including reviews of efficacy and safety for regulatory and public health policy approvals. Officials in each country closely review the study data and decide\r\n        whether to authorize the vaccine for use. A vaccine must be proven to be safe and effective across a broad population before it will be approved and introduced into a national immunization programme. The bar for vaccine safety and efficacy is\r\n        extremely high, recognizing that vaccines are given to people who are otherwise healthy and specifically free from the illness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Further monitoring takes place in an ongoing way after the vaccine is introduced. There are systems to monitor the safety and effectiveness of all vaccines. This enables scientists to keep track of vaccine impact and safety even as they are used in\r\n        a large number of people, over a long time frame.&amp;nbsp; These data are used to adjust the policies for vaccine use to optimize their impact, and they also allow the vaccine to be safely tracked throughout its use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once a vaccine is in use, it must be continuously monitored to make sure it continues to be safe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-blue-background\&quot;=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;text-align:center;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/manufacturing-safety-and-quality-control/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-marked=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Read the next &#39;Vaccines explained&#39; topic: \&quot;Manufacturing, safety and quality control of vaccines\&quot; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//how-are-vaccines-developed</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//how-are-vaccines-developed</guid><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>How do vaccines work?</title><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution.

When a person is susceptible and they encounter a harmful organism, it can lead to disease and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;The body has many ways of defending itself against&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;pathogens&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(disease-causing organisms). Skin, mucus, and cilia (microscopic hairs that move debris away from the lungs) all work as physical barriers to prevent pathogens\r\n        from entering the body in the first place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;When a pathogen does infect the body, our body’s defences, called the immune system, are triggered and the pathogen is attacked and destroyed or overcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2 dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;The body&#39;s natural response&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;A pathogen is a bacterium, virus, parasite or fungus that can cause disease within the body. Each pathogen is made up of several subparts, usually unique to that specific pathogen and the disease it causes. The subpart of a pathogen that causes the\r\n        formation of antibodies is called an antigen. The antibodies produced in response to the pathogen’s antigen are an important part of the immune system. You can consider antibodies as the soldiers in your body’s defense system. Each\r\n        antibody, or soldier, in our system is trained to recognize one specific antigen. We have thousands of different antibodies in our bodies. When the human body is exposed to an antigen for the first time, it takes time for the immune system to\r\n        respond and produce antibodies specific to that antigen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;In the meantime, the person is susceptible to becoming ill.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Once the antigen-specific antibodies are produced, they work with the rest of the immune system to destroy the pathogen and stop the disease. Antibodies to one pathogen generally don’t protect against another pathogen except when two pathogens\r\n        are very similar to each other, like cousins. Once the body produces antibodies in its primary response to an antigen, it also creates antibody-producing memory cells, which remain alive even after the pathogen is defeated by the antibodies. If\r\n        the body is exposed to the same pathogen more than once, the antibody response is much faster and more effective than the first time around because the memory cells are at the ready to pump out antibodies against that antigen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;This means that if the person is exposed to the dangerous pathogen in the future, their immune system will be able to respond immediately, protecting against disease.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-antibody-illustration-01-29-oct7f4a97bd839b4b6996c82c1832a52682.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=d0d1dc56_9\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;Vaccines&quot; antibody=&quot;&quot; illustration=&quot;&quot; 01_29=&quot;&quot; oct\&quot;=&quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;458430\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How vaccines help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines contain weakened or inactive parts of a particular organism (antigen) that triggers an immune response within the body. Newer vaccines contain the blueprint for producing antigens rather than the antigen itself. Regardless of whether the vaccine\r\n    is made up of the antigen itself or the blueprint so that the body will produce the antigen, this weakened version will not cause the disease in the person receiving the vaccine, but it will prompt their immune system to respond much as it would have\r\n    on its first reaction to the actual pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-antibody-illustration-02-29-oct.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=a79ee886_36\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;Vaccines&quot; antibody=&quot;&quot; illustration=&quot;&quot; 02_29=&quot;&quot; oct\&quot;=&quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;554468\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some vaccines require multiple doses, given weeks or months apart. This is sometimes needed to allow for the production of long-lived antibodies and development of memory cells. In this way, the body is trained to fight the specific disease-causing organism,\r\n    building up memory of the pathogen so as to rapidly fight it if and when exposed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Herd immunity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;When someone is vaccinated, they are very likely to be protected against the targeted disease. But not everyone can be vaccinated. People with underlying health conditions that weaken their immune systems (such as cancer or HIV) or who have severe allergies\r\n    to some vaccine components may not be able to get vaccinated with certain vaccines. These people can still be protected if they live in and amongst others who are vaccinated. When a lot of people in a community are vaccinated the pathogen has a hard\r\n    time circulating because most of the people it encounters are immune. So the more that others are vaccinated, the less likely people who are unable to be protected by vaccines are at risk of even being exposed to the harmful pathogens. This is called\r\n    herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;This is especially important for those people who not only can’t be vaccinated but may be more susceptible to the diseases we vaccinate against. No single vaccine provides 100% protection, and herd immunity does not provide full protection to those\r\n    who cannot safely be vaccinated. But with herd immunity, these people will have substantial protection, thanks to those around them being vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Vaccinating not only protects yourself, but also protects those in the community who are unable to be vaccinated. If you are able to, get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/herd1.png?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=62c2f66a_53\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;Herd1\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;178213\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img 1=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-topic-1-illustrations-04.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=72e55c08_11\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;Vaccines&quot; topic=&quot;&quot; illustrations=&quot;&quot; 04\&quot;=&quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;723494\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Throughout history, humans have successfully developed vaccines for a number of life-threatening diseases, including meningitis, tetanus, measles and&amp;nbsp;wild poliovirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;width:571px;height:315px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot; contenteditable=&quot;\&amp;quot;false\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-sf-disable-link-event=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/embed/SkSdFnzjNPs/%22&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;\&amp;quot;571\&amp;quot;&quot; height=&quot;\&amp;quot;315\&amp;quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;In the early 1900s, polio was a worldwide disease, paralysing hundreds of thousands of people every year. By 1950, two effective vaccines against the disease had been developed. But vaccination in some parts of the world was still not common enough to\r\n    stop the spread of polio, particularly in Africa. In the 1980s, a united worldwide effort to eradicate polio from the planet began. Over many years and several decades, polio vaccination, using routine immunization visits and mass vaccination campaigns,\r\n    has taken place in all continents. Millions of people, mostly children, have been vaccinated and in August 2020, the African continent was certified&amp;nbsp;wild poliovirus free, joining all other parts of the world except Pakistan and Afghanistan, where\r\n    polio has not yet been eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-blue-background\&quot;=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;text-align:center;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/how-are-vaccines-developed/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-marked=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Read next &#39;Vaccines Explained&#39; topic: \&quot;How are vaccines developed?”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//how-do-vaccines-work</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//how-do-vaccines-work</guid><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Manufacturing, safety and quality control of vaccines</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;This article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution.

Following regulatory approval, manufacturers can submit a vaccine to WHO\r\n    for prequalification (PQ), an assessment process that ensures quality, safety and efficacy and helps the UN and other international procurement organizations determine\r\n    the programmatic suitability of a vaccine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; contenteditable=&quot;\&amp;quot;false\&amp;quot;&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;width:560px;height:315px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-sf-disable-link-event=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;\&amp;quot;560\&amp;quot;&quot; height=&quot;\&amp;quot;315\&amp;quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/embed/WvomdZFF__A/%22&quot; frameborder=&quot;\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During global health emergencies,&amp;nbsp;the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://who.int/teams/regulation-prequalification/eul#:~:text=The%20WHO%20Emergency%20Use%20Listing,by%20a%20public%20health%20emergency.\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;WHO Emergency Use Listing Procedure&lt;/a&gt; (EUL) may be used to allow emergency use of the vaccine. The EUL exists because, in a pandemic situation, products that could benefit the lives of people all over the world may be prevented from coming to market with sufficient speed. The EUL is a\r\n    fast-tracked but rigorous process, designed to bring impactful products to all those in need, as quickly as possible, on a time-limited basis and based on a risk-versus-benefit evaluation. The WHO PQ/EUL recommendation may be used by UN agencies such\r\n    as UNICEF and the Pan American Health Organization Revolving Fund for procurement decisions in low- and middle-income countries.&amp;nbsp;Gavi also relies on WHO EUL/PQ to specify which vaccines its funds may be used to purchase. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it’s made&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically,&amp;nbsp;companies will work independently to complete clinical development plans for a vaccine. Once a vaccine is authorized, manufacturing begins to scale up.

To form the full vaccine, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines/how-are-vaccines-developed/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;all ingredients&lt;/a&gt; are combined.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole process, from preclinical trial to manufacture, can sometimes take over a decade to complete. In the search for a COVID-19 vaccine, researchers and developers are working on several different phases in parallel, to speed up results. It is the\r\n    scale of the financial and political commitments to the development of a vaccine that has allowed this accelerated development to take place. Also, nations and international health organizations are working together through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://who.int/initiatives/act-accelerator/covax/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;COVAX&lt;/a&gt; to invest in development capacity upfront to streamline the process, as well as to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it’s packaged&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the vaccine has been made in bulk quantities’, it is bottled in glass vials and then carefully packaged for safe cold storage and transport.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine packaging must be able to withstand extreme temperatures, as well as the risks involved in being transported globally. Therefore, vaccine vials are most commonly made from glass, as it is durable and able to maintain its integrity in extreme temperatures.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it’s stored&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a vaccine is too hot or too cold, it becomes less effective or even inactive. If stored at the incorrect temperature, vaccines can be ruined or unsafe for use. Most vaccines require refrigerated storage at between 2 and 8 °C.&amp;nbsp;Some vaccines\r\n    require temperatures as cold as -20°C. Some of the newer vaccines need to be kept ultra cold at &amp;nbsp;-70°C.&amp;nbsp; For frozen vaccines some of them can be safely stored for a limited time between 2 and 8°C.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular refrigerators cannot maintain an even temperature consistently, so specialized medical refrigerators are required for these precious products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it’s shipped&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To maintain this cold chain, vaccines are shipped using specialized equipment that does not compromise the integrity of the product. Once shipments land in the destination country, refrigerated lorries transport the vaccines from the airport to the warehouse\r\n    cold room. From there, portable iceboxes are used to transport vaccines from the cold room to regional centres where they’re stored in refrigerators. If vaccination takes place outside of the regional facility, the final step often requires\r\n    portable iceboxes to transport the goods to local areas for vaccination campaigns.&amp;nbsp; New technologies have invented some portable devices that can keep vaccines at their cold temperature for several days without needing electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; contenteditable=&quot;\&amp;quot;false\&amp;quot;&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;width:560px;height:315px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-sf-disable-link-event=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;\&amp;quot;560\&amp;quot;&quot; height=&quot;\&amp;quot;315\&amp;quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/embed/4SaDefN5L4k/%22&quot; frameborder=&quot;\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;font-size:25px;text-align:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Quality control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once vaccines start being administered, national authorities and WHO constantly monitor for – and establish the severity of – any possible adverse side effects and responses from people who have received the vaccine. The safety of the vaccine\r\n    is paramount, with regular assessments and post-approval clinical studies to report on its safety and effectiveness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies are often conducted to determine how long a given vaccine remains protective.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;\&amp;quot;button&quot; button-blue-background\&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-race-for-a-covid-19-vaccine-explained/%22&quot;&gt;Read the next &#39;Vaccines Explained&#39; topic: \&quot;The different types of COVID-19 vaccines\&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//manufacturing-safety-and-quality-control</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//manufacturing-safety-and-quality-control</guid><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
