But the grey weather comes with an upside: this city pours its heart and soul into its cultural pursuits. After all, when there’s little chance of lolling around in the sun, you may as well start an art movement, a band or a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The household names to have come out of Glasgow are legion — from designer-architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh, football manager Alex Ferguson and singer Lulu to actor Peter Capaldi and comedian Frankie Boyle — and you’ll find some of the UK’s best theatres, music venues and museums here.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Walking around the city centre, Glasgow’s prosperous past is evident: its grand Victorian banking halls, civic buildings and merchants’ homes serve as towering sandstone reminders of its 19th-century status as the second city of the British Empire. Once, more than half of Britain’s tobacco was landed on the River&amp;nbsp;Clyde and a fifth of the world’s ships were built here. Its decline was painful, with the late-20th-century shutdown of shipbuilders, coal mines and steelworks resulting in mass unemployment. Though the city still ranks as one of the UK’s poorest, Glasgow has undergone decades of regeneration. One example is its celebrated Citizens Theatre due to reopen after major refurbishment this year.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Many attractions lie inside the curled arms of the M8 and M74, which run close to the historic centre. However, it’s worth branching out to the West End, where you’ll find Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, one of the city’s finest, as well as the Botanic Gardens and the Mackintosh House.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;This is a city that rewards exploration on two feet, allowing you to change your plans on a whim and follow the sound of live folk music or the smell of Scottish beef sizzling on a grill. You’ll find most Glaswegians keen to pause for a chat, too; be ready to get waylaid for a good old&amp;nbsp;‘blether’.&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://glasgowmusiccitytours.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Merchant City Tour&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: A UNESCO City of Music and home to numerous superb small venues, Glasgow has music tour takes in some of the top musical sites, telling tales of famous names and infamous gigs. You’ll see the two-centuries-old The Clutha, a bar that’s hosted everyone from Woodie Guthrie to Frank Zappa, and Barrowland Ballroom, a&amp;nbsp;venue that counts&amp;nbsp;Oasis, Metallica and LCD Soundsystem among its past performers.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theclydeside.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clydeside Distillery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Opened on the waterfront in 2017, this distillery turns out fine Lowland-style whiskies, including Napier, matured in sherry casks for a sweeter finish. You could take a straightforward one-hour whisky tour, but why do just that when there’s a chocolate-and-whisky tour on offer? You’ll&amp;nbsp;sample five different drams, each paired with a chocolate made by artisan producer Sugarsnap.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://walkingtoursin.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Glasgow Street Art Tour&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: This guided 90-minute walk offers insight into the city’s character. It includes political and historical works by locally based artists like Smug and Rogue-One — the latter’s depictions of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Billy Connolly are a highlight — and a legal graffiti site on the Clyde Walkway, where artists have free rein as part of a pilot scheme.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://burrellcollection.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Burrell Collection&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: If you only have time for one of Glasgow’s many free-to-enter museums, don’t miss the collection amassed by shipping magnate William Burrell. Gifted to the city in 1944, its 9,000 objects include The Red Ballet Skirts by Edgar Degas and a bronze cast of The Thinker by Auguste Rodin. The Burrell Collection is set within Pollok Country Park, where you can also see ginger-coated Highland cows.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mackintoshatthewillow.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mackintosh at the Willow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Designer- architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh was born in Glasgow in 1868 and pioneered the distinctive Glasgow Style, a form of art nouveau. He also designed many buildings in the city, including this tearoom on Sauchiehall Street. As well as serving cream teas, it houses an exhibition about Mackintosh and a shop selling cards, glassworks and jewellery in his style.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://glasgownecropolis.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Glasgow Necropolis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Sprawled across a hill beside Glasgow Cathedral (the city’s oldest building), this Victorian cemetery is home to 3,500 tombs, many incredibly ornate. Wander amid the graves of merchants, shipowners and politicians to find the Celtic cross designed by Mackintosh.&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thesocialhub.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Social Hub&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: On the edge of Merchant City, straightforward hotel rooms are mixed with extended-stay accommodation, with everyone coming together on the open-plan ground floor to dine in the classy cafe. Bedrooms are simple, but the best have far-reaching views of the city.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theaddressglasgow.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Address Glasgow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: This 1920s building with a neo-classical facade is in the heart of the centre, close to train stations and many of Glasgow’s best restaurants — try Sugo for pasta. No two bedrooms are alike; the pouting red lips behind reception nod to the fun artworks you’ll find throughout.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kimptonblythswoodsquare.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kimpton Blythswood Square Hotel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: This five-star spot on one of Glasgow’s finest Georgian squares has bedrooms decorated in dark marble and cosy tweed. There’s a spacious spa, with Scottish island-themed hydrotherapy pools and thermal suites, and the on-site restaurant Iasg (‘fish’ in Gaelic) serves sustainable Scottish seafood, including smoked salmon and Cumbrae oysters.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://royarestaurant.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Roy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;â&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: You’ll be tempted to order every dish you see landing on nearby tables at this homely Middle Eastern restaurant in the city centre, from the fiery red mouhamara dip dotted with pomegranate seeds to the charred corn ribs crumbled with feta. Alongside the many vegan and vegetarian options, there are also meat kebabs.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brettrestaurant.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brett&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Nab a seat at the chef’s counter of this intimate restaurant on Great Western Road and you’ll realise why it’s worth the 25-minute walk west from the city centre. Dishes have a decidedly Michelin air —&amp;nbsp;the restaurant’s sister venue, Cail Bruich, currently holds one star — and include the likes of monkfish served with bergamot, wild&amp;nbsp;garlic and fermented fennel.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamba.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gamba&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Occupying a warm and welcoming basement on West George Street in the city centre, this elegant restaurant serves Scottish seafood with a twist — from scallop sashimi to classics like lobster thermidor. Settle in with its well-chosen wine list and extensive whisky selection.&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thehiddenlaneglasgow.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Hidden Lane&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Duck down this colourful lane off Argyle Street, in Finnieston, to find bespoke jewellery at the studios of Heather McDermott and Fiona Hutchison-Barr; sustainable fashion at House of Black; and pick and mix at Simba’s Sweets. You can refuel with homemade cake at The Hidden Lane Tearoom.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foodies by&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scottishdesignexchange.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; SDX&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Small producers can struggle to get a look in on city high streets, which is why the Scottish Design Exchange gives the best homegrown brands a chance to&amp;nbsp;appear in its shop window. Its food-focused store in Buchanan Galleries stocks a range of&amp;nbsp;local produce, from hot sauces and honeys to crisps and oatcakes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://monorailmusic.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monorail Music&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Glasgow has a selection of record shops to root around in. One of the best is central Monorail Music, loved by collectors for its curated selection of LPs and regular small gigs and events. &lt;a href=&quot;https://assai.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Assai Records&lt;/a&gt; is another vinyl specialist and its Sauchiehall Street store includes a rack of Scottish music.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kingtuts.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Opened in 1990 and beloved since, this intimate music venue on central St Vincent Street invites you to squish down a bit, get cosy&amp;nbsp;in the crowd and stand within guitar-swinging distance of the stage. Often&amp;nbsp;one of the first venues played by emerging artists, this is a place to discover the next big thing, having hosted everyone from Pulp to Biffy&amp;nbsp;Clyro.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/devilofbrooklyn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Devil of Brooklyn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: The interior of this city centre cocktail bar, located in a former banking hall,&amp;nbsp;is a mix of hanging plants, flickering candles, neon-red ceiling lights and a marble fireplace. The grand, historic setting is teamed&amp;nbsp;with a very current drinks list, featuring all manner of homemade ingredients as well as unusual vermouths and liqueurs.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thepotstill.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Pot Still&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: This long-standing whisky joint in the heart of Glasgow claims to serve more than 1,000 different drams, and staff take pride in finding every customer their perfect match. Prime spots are the red-leather banquette seats or bar-side, where you can rest an elbow while scanning the bottle-lined walls.&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shop for one-offs&lt;/b&gt;: The city’s markets are the best places to unearth a bargain. Established in 1921, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theglasgowbarras.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Barras&lt;/a&gt; in the East End is open every weekend and good for antiques and vintage fashion, while the twice-monthly &lt;a href=&quot;https://parklanemarket.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Park Lane Market&lt;/a&gt; in the suburb of Shawlands is the place to go for artwork, jewellery and handmade clothing.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hear Grassroots music&lt;/b&gt;: Discover new names at the city’s smaller venues. For&amp;nbsp;folk, head along to the relaxed sessions at &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/lismorebar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Lismore&lt;/a&gt;, in Partick; for jazz, visit the city centre’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebutterflyandthepig.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Butterfly and the Pig&lt;/a&gt;, a Georgian townhouse with a small basement stage that hosts students from the&amp;nbsp;Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Head for Dennistoun&lt;/b&gt;: Duke Street is the main drag of this up-and-coming easterly suburb. It’s home to an enticing food scene, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://tibobistro.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tibo&lt;/a&gt; for brunch and the family-run institution &lt;a href=&quot;https://coiascafe.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Coia’s Café&lt;/a&gt;. Pubs take over at night: both Redmond’s and &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepalaisbar.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Palais Bar&lt;/a&gt; have craft beer, live music and great cocktails.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ba.com/holidays&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BA Holidays &lt;/a&gt;has three nights at the DoubleTree by Hilton Glasgow Central&amp;nbsp;from £239 per person, including flights from Heathrow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting there &amp;amp; around&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trains run to Glasgow Central on the West Coast Main Line, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://avantiwestcoast.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Avanti West Coast&lt;/a&gt; offering direct services from stations including London Euston, Milton Keynes, Birmingham New Street, Crewe and Lancaster. Fast trains from London take as little as four and a half hours, while from Birmingham it’s four hours and from Lancaster two hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Glasgow also has an international airport, with flights across the UK.&lt;br&gt;Average journey time from London: 5h45m.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s almost entirely possible to get around Glasgow on foot, although the &lt;a href=&quot;https://spt.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Subway &lt;/a&gt;can also be useful — it runs in a circle, from the city centre to the West End and back. Visitors are best off buying a paper ticket for each journey. To reach the Burrell Collection, it’s a 10-minute &lt;a href=&quot;https://scotrail.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ScotRail&lt;/a&gt; train journey from Glasgow Central to Pollokshaws West.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;When to go&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Glasgow’s climate is famously wet, but the spring and early summer months (April to July) are the driest. May has the highest number of sunshine hours (almost 200) and the lowest rainfall, while July is warmest, with average highs of around 19C. December is the wettest and coldest month, with average lows of 1C.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wrap up warmly and winter can be a fun time to visit: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://celticconnections.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Celtic Connections&lt;/a&gt; music festival is held in January and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://glasgowcomedyfestival.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Glasgow International Comedy Festival&lt;/a&gt; showcases Scottish stand-up talent every March.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;More info:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Glasgow: The Autobiography&lt;/i&gt;. £12.99&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scotland Beyond the Bagpipes.&lt;/i&gt; £9.99&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was created with the support of&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://visitglasgow.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt; Visit Glasgow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://visitscotland.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Visit Scotland&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;Published in the March 2025 issue of &lt;i&gt;National Geographic Traveller&lt;/i&gt; (UK).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To subscribe to&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;National Geographic Traveller&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;(UK) magazine click &lt;a href=&quot;https://checkout.natgeotraveller.co.uk/offers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

See full disclaimer below.*&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;The best swim trucks blend quick-drying materials, comfort, and style. For some, that means one that doesn’t restrict movement. “I like a shorter swim trunk—nothing down to my knees. It should be lightweight, not restrictive, and not create drag while swimming,” says Peyton Bergmann, a teacher and avid outdoorsman based in Ypsilanti, Michigan. “I also want options—something with a cool design, not just a plain color.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Others prefer trunks that transition seamlessly from the water to everyday activities. “I prefer versatile swim trunks that work for multiple activities—something with a built-in liner, zippered pockets, and an athletic material that looks good but performs well in and out of the water,” says Justin Shachter, a NASA engineer and outdoor community enthusiast based in Los Angeles, California.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.skimresources.com/?id=251963X1735872&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://vuoriclothing.com/products/banks-short-sky-grey-linen-texture&amp;amp;xcust=web-lifestyle-swim-trunks-2025mar-20&amp;amp;sref=nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/Best-swim-trunks-for-men&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vuori Banks Short&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; checks all these boxes, making it our top overall pick for most travelers. Made with a quick-drying, recycled polyester, with four-way stretch and anti-odor technology, these men’s swim trunks are designed for all-day wear in and out of the water.

Look for lightweight fabrics like polyester or nylon, which dry quickly and won’t weigh you down in the water. An elastic waistband and drawstring help ensure a snug yet flexible fit. If you prefer added support, consider compression liners, which reduce chafing and enhance comfort. For storage, zippered pockets are best for securing small essentials. Finally, think about inseam length—a five-inch inseam provides a modern, athletic cut, while seven- to nine-inch styles offer more coverage and versatility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why we like it:&lt;/b&gt; Vuori’s Banks Short is a do-it-all essential, seamlessly transitioning from the ocean to the gym and even casual outings. Made from recycled polyester with four-way stretch and two inseam lengths (five- and seven-inch), these trunks offer unrestricted movement and quick-drying performance. The anti-odor technology helps keep them feeling fresh, even after a long day in the sun. With a tailored fit and versatile colorways, they’re a stylish yet practical choice for any waterside activity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep in mind:&lt;/b&gt; The fit runs slightly slim, so consider sizing up for a more relaxed feel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product details:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Material:&lt;/b&gt; 44% recycled polyester, according to the brand; 44% polyester; 12% elastane | &lt;b&gt;Sizes:&lt;/b&gt; S-XXL | &lt;b&gt;Colors:&lt;/b&gt; 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why we like it:&lt;/b&gt; If you want extra support and zero chafing, these lined trunks from Chubbies are a good bet. The built-in compression liner is made to feel smooth against the skin, helping to eliminate irritation from sand and saltwater. With a retro-inspired five-and-a-half-inch inseam (plus two more options), these shorts offer a balance of athleticism and laid-back style, making them ideal for swimming, jogging, or just hanging by the pool.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep in mind:&lt;/b&gt; The bold prints and shorter length may not be for everyone—go for these if you like a statement-making look. However, you can also choose the seven-inch inseam, which comes in basic colors.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product details:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Material:&lt;/b&gt; 92% polyester, 8% spandex | &lt;b&gt;Sizes:&lt;/b&gt; XS-3XL | &lt;b&gt;Colors:&lt;/b&gt; Various patterns and solid colors&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/best-swimsuit-for-women&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pros love these swimsuits for women&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why we like it:&lt;/b&gt; Patagonia’s Baggies have earned their legendary status for a reason. These classic, go-anywhere swim trunks are crafted from 100-percent recycled nylon and coated with a DWR (durable water repellent) finish, helping them dry quickly after a dip. The relaxed, roomy fit makes them perfect for guys who want a little extra mobility, whether you’re hiking to a secret swimming hole or just lounging on the sand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep in mind:&lt;/b&gt; Travelers who prefer a slim or short style may find these a bit baggy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product details:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Material:&lt;/b&gt; 100% recycled nylon, according to the brand | &lt;b&gt;Sizes:&lt;/b&gt; XS-XXL | &lt;b&gt;Colors:&lt;/b&gt; Multiple&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why we like it:&lt;/b&gt; If you want no-fuss swim trunks that stay put, L.L. Bean’s Classic Supplex shorts are a reliable pick. The elastic waistband and functional drawstring provide a secure fit, while the lightweight Supplex fabric is made to dry fast and offers UPF 50+ sun protection. Designed to handle everything from casual swims to active beach days, these shorts combine classic style with performance-driven details.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep in mind:&lt;/b&gt; These swim trunks are made with a structured fabric, which lacks stretch. They may not offer as much flexibility as some athletic swim trunks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product details:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Material:&lt;/b&gt; 100% nylon Supplex | &lt;b&gt;Sizes:&lt;/b&gt; S-3XL | &lt;b&gt;Colors:&lt;/b&gt; Multiple&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/beach-essentials&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Don’t leave for the beach without these essentials&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why we like it:&lt;/b&gt; For guys who prefer more coverage, Maui Rippers’ extra-long 24-inch board shorts extend well below the knee, offering a relaxed yet functional fit. The four-way stretch fabric ensures comfort and mobility, while the Velcro fly and tie waistband provide a secure fit, even in rough surf. These are great for surfers, paddleboarders, or anyone looking for a longer silhouette.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;We also like these &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Kanu-Surf-Barracuda-Charcoal-X-Large/dp/B007T27LT0?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=web-lifestyle-swim-trunks-2025mar-20&amp;amp;linkId=5f3901594b62887cbe20eac06b5cf7d7&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kanu Surf Barracuda Swim Trunks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. With a nine-inch inseam, they’re not as long as our first choice, but they’re made with a quick-drying microfiber and have a UPF 50+ rating, all for about 20 bucks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep in mind:&lt;/b&gt; The extended length on the Maui Rippers may feel restrictive for high-mobility activities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product details:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Material:&lt;/b&gt; 90% polyester, 10% spandex | &lt;b&gt;Sizes:&lt;/b&gt; 28-44 | &lt;b&gt;Colors:&lt;/b&gt; Multiple&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why we like it:&lt;/b&gt; Whether you’re hopping on a boat or hitting a beach bar, these tailored swim trunks offer both security and style for active travelers. The hidden zippered back pocket is a standout feature, giving you a safe place to stash small essentials like cards or keys. Plus, these lined shorts are made from recycled plastic bottles, according to the brand. The DWR finish helps these trunks dry pretty fast too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Trunks-Shorts-Zipper-Pockets-Bathing/dp/B09XM3GM32?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=web-lifestyle-swim-trunks-2025mar-20&amp;amp;linkId=40085bc072fecd1e65596436fe54fe47&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;G Gradual &lt;u&gt;Trunks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have a similar zippered pocket design at a lower price. They’re made to dry quickly and have UPF 50+. However, keep in mind that these don’t have a mesh liner.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep in mind:&lt;/b&gt; Reviewers say the Fair Harbor Anchor short tends to run small, so size up if you want more room.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product details:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Material:&lt;/b&gt; 88% recycled polyester, 12% spandex | &lt;b&gt;Sizes:&lt;/b&gt; S-3XXL | &lt;b&gt;Colors:&lt;/b&gt; Multiple available&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/best-beach-bags&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;We love these hold-everything beach bags&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why we like it:&lt;/b&gt; These premium swim trunks blend upscale style with technical performance. The minimalist look makes them versatile enough to wear beyond the beach, while the quick-drying, four-way stretch fabric and tailored cut offer a modern look. If you want swimwear that feels fashion-forward yet functional, this is an excellent pick.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;If you want more size and color options, the pricey&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://go.skimresources.com/?id=251963X1735872&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.vilebrequin.com/us/en/men-swimtrunks/WB-MOOC4A00-HOM.html&amp;amp;xcust=web-lifestyle-swim-trunks-2025mar-20&amp;amp;sref=nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/Best-swim-trunks-for-men&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Moorea Swim Trunks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from heritage luxury brand Vilebrequin, come in XS-3XL and nine colors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep in mind:&lt;/b&gt; The Bather swim trunks are the most expensive on this list. However, the quality and versatility may make them a worthwhile investment for some travelers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product details:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Material:&lt;/b&gt; 92% recycled polyester, 8% elastane | &lt;b&gt;Sizes:&lt;/b&gt; 28-38 | &lt;b&gt;Colors:&lt;/b&gt; 4&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/best-reef-safe-sunscreen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Heading to the beach? Don’t forget to pack reef-safe sunscreen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why we like it:&lt;/b&gt; These lightweight swim trunks are designed for both water and land, making them a great pick for casual swimmers and outdoor enthusiasts. At $45, they offer good value. Made with Columbia’s UPF 50 Omni-Shield water-repellent fabric, they dry quickly and resist stains, perfect for long days at the beach or a fishing trip. The elastic waistband adds all-day comfort, and the classic design makes them easy to wear. We also love the zippered back pocket for holding small valuables.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep in mind:&lt;/b&gt; The relaxed fit may feel too loose. Some reviewers say the sizing is a bit off, so you may want to order different sizes or try these on in person, where possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product details:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Material:&lt;/b&gt; 100% nylon | &lt;b&gt;Sizes:&lt;/b&gt; XS-XXL (standard, big) | &lt;b&gt;Colors:&lt;/b&gt; Multiple&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/best-sun-protection-shirts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here’s why we’re packing sun shirts on our next beach getaway&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;The best swim trunks should strike a balance between style, comfort, and functionality, ensuring they perform well both in and out of the water. To curate this list, we evaluated a range of factors, from fabric quality and fit to performance-driven details like quick-drying materials and secure pockets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;•&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Third-party reviews:&lt;/b&gt; We analyzed customer reviews and expert insights to gauge real-world performance, ensuring these swim trunks live up to the hype in terms of comfort, durability, and water resistance.&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;•&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brand reputation:&lt;/b&gt; We focused on brands known for high-quality swimwear, reliable craftsmanship, and positive customer feedback. Companies with strong reputations for innovative designs, sustainable materials, and ethical production practices ranked higher in our selection.&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;•&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Material &amp;amp; quick-drying properties:&lt;/b&gt; A good pair of swim trunks should dry quickly and feel comfortable, so we prioritized moisture-wicking fabrics like recycled polyester, nylon, and Supplex. These materials prevent excess water retention, reducing discomfort and chafing when transitioning from swimming to lounging.&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;•&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fit &amp;amp; inseam length options:&lt;/b&gt; Swim shorts should offer both comfort and mobility, whether you prefer short, mid-length, or long boardshorts. We included a variety of cuts to suit different styles and body types, ensuring there’s an option for everyone.&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;•&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liner vs. no liner:&lt;/b&gt; Some men prefer the built-in support of a compression liner, while others like the freedom of an unlined trunk. We featured both options to cater to personal preferences and comfort levels.&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;•&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Special features:&lt;/b&gt; Extra details like zippered pockets, UPF protection, stretch fabrics, and secure waistbands add functionality making swim trunks more versatile for outdoor adventures and travel.&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;•&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sustainability:&lt;/b&gt; With more brands focusing on sustainable production, we prioritized swim trunks made with recycled materials, such as reclaimed ocean plastics and repurposed nylon. Companies with transparent sustainability initiatives received extra consideration.&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The right inseam length&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The length of your swim trunks affects both style and function. A five-inch inseam offers a sportier, retro-inspired look and allows for more mobility. These styles are ideal for active swimmers and surfers. A seven-inch inseam provides a balance between coverage and freedom of movement, while nine-inch board shorts offer extra protection for those who prefer longer styles or need more sun coverage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quick-drying materials&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Swim trunks should be made from lightweight, fast-drying fabrics like polyester or nylon to prevent discomfort and chafing when transitioning from water to land. Recycled materials provide durability and performance. Avoid heavy cotton blends, which retain moisture and take longer to dry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Compression liner for support&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Because traditional mesh liners can be irritating, especially during long wear, many brands now offer built-in compression liners for extra support and comfort. These reduce chafing, wick moisture, and keep everything in place while swimming or being active. If you prefer a looser fit, look for unlined options that allow you to wear your own compression shorts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Functionality and features&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;For all-day wear, consider hybrid swim trunks that look like casual shorts but function as swimwear. Features like zippered pockets keep valuables secure, elastic waistbands with drawstrings offer an adjustable fit, and UPF-rated fabrics provide extra sun protection. If you plan to go from the water to lunch, a versatile design with a structured look is ideal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The right style&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;While classic solid colors never go out of style, we like bold florals, retro stripes, and abstract designs as much as the next guy. Muted earth tones or neutral hues offer a timeless, sophisticated feel. It’s a personal choice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sustainability &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Many brands are now making swim trunks from recycled plastic bottles or fishing nets, reducing environmental impact without compromising performance. If sustainability is important to you, look for brands with certifications and ethical production practices, while being careful to avoid “green washing.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is the difference between swim trunks and swim shorts?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Swim trunks and swim shorts are often used interchangeably, but trunks typically refer to short, elastic-waist styles made from lightweight, quick-drying fabric. Swim shorts, on the other hand, may have a more tailored fit with a button or zip fly suitable for both swimming and casual wear.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is the best length for swim trunks in men?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ideal length depends on personal preference and body type. A five-inch inseam offers a modern, athletic cut, while seven-inch trunks provide a balance of coverage and mobility. For extra protection or a surf-inspired look, nine-inch board shorts extend closer to the knee.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What does a compression liner do in men’s swim trunks?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A compression liner provides built-in support, which can reduce chafing and offer a secure fit while swimming or moving around. It also wicks moisture and dries faster than traditional mesh liners, making it a great choice for active swimmers and all-day wear. One great option is our top pick, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.skimresources.com/?id=251963X1735872&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.chubbiesshorts.com/products/the-midnight-palms-5-5-classic-lined-swim-trunk&amp;amp;xcust=web-lifestyle-swim-trunks-2025mar-20&amp;amp;sref=nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/Best-swim-trunks-for-men&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chubbies The Midnight Palms&lt;/a&gt;, which features a soft compression liner for extra comfort and support.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.griffzales.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Griffin Gonzales&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a freelance writer based in Detroit, Michigan, specializing in menswear and American-made products.

Williams and Wilmore were supposed to spend roughly eight days in space, after arriving on the Boeing Starliner&#39;s first flight in June.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;As Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore finally return home, here&#39;s where they fit in a long list of astronauts who got to spend more time on the ISS than expected.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to technical problems with their Boeing Starliner spacecraft, Sunita Williams and Barry &quot;Butch&quot; Wilmore have spent a lot more time on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/international-space-station-article&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; than originally planned. After around nine months in space, they returned to Earth aboard a SpaceX capsule with two other astronauts. The spacecraft &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-to-provide-live-coverage-of-crew-9-return-splashdown/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;journeyed 17 hours&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/welcome-home-nasas-spacex-crew-9-back-on-earth-after-science-mission/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;splashed down&lt;/a&gt; at 5:57pm EDT on March 18.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;But these astronauts were not the first spacefarers to get “stranded” in space, and they probably won’t be the last.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Dealing with such difficulties is an essential task for an astronaut—and Williams and Wilmore might have been secretly pleased with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Astronauts consider themselves ‘stranded’ on Earth, so this is a huge gift,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrishadfield.ca/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chris Hadfield&lt;/a&gt;, a former NASA astronaut, space shuttle pilot and long-term crew commander on the ISS. “It’s the purpose of our profession.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Call it a “stranding”, a delay, or an extended mission, astronauts spend extra time in space every now and then. Reasons vary from the geopolitical to natural hazards of space travel. But whatever the cause, astronauts and space agencies prepare for these scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;Williams and Wilmore were scheduled to spend eight days on the ISS, after &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2024/06/06/boeings-crew-flight-test-on-starliner-docks-to-station/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;arriving there on the Starliner’s first flight&lt;/a&gt; in June of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;But even before the launch and during the journey to the ISS, Starliner was plagued by leaks of the helium gas used to push fuel into its thrusters. NASA and Boeing tried to work through the problems, but in August, NASA announced their plan for Williams and Wilmore to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-decides-to-bring-starliner-spacecraft-back-to-earth-without-crew/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;return on the next SpaceX Dragon&lt;/a&gt; spacecraft scheduled to bring a crew back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Starliner &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.nasa.gov/boeing-crew-flight-test/2024/09/07/starliner-lands-in-new-mexico/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;made its own automated descent&lt;/a&gt;, landing in New Mexico in September 2024. But Williams and Wilmore had to wait for a SpaceX relief team to reach the ISS. That crew finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/blogs/spacestation/2025/03/16/dragon-crew-enters-station-and-joins-expedition-72-crew/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;arrived on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;, after dealing with their own battery and hydraulics issues.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;That means the two astronauts spent roughly 286 days on the ISS—where missions typically only run as long as six months—and orbited Earth 4,576 times.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Hadfield, formerly a U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy test pilot, says issues are expected during the first flight of any spacecraft; but he adds that he understands why NASA has acted to ensure the crew’s safety.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;For astronauts, the more time in space, the better. “You train for decades so that you have an opportunity to spend extended periods of time in space—and this turned their short duration flight into a long-duration flight,” he notes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.natgeofe.com/n/69a216fd-2896-4043-9be5-01ebce6dbdb6/GettyImages-541371324.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Man in white space suit smiling at the sun.&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Soviet Union formally dissolved during cosmonaut&amp;nbsp;Sergei Krikalev&#39;s&amp;nbsp;mission aboard the Mir space station in 1991, extending his time in space from 150 days to 311 days.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.natgeofe.com/n/525bc0c4-2bfc-4fff-9dd7-5c6c0c32cb2d/STS063-711-080~large.crop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Person looking outside from the space ship.&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cosmonaut Valery Polyakov (pictured) boarded the Mir space station on January 8, 1994, and left the station on March 22, 1995, setting a record of 437 days and 18 hours of continuous time in space.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;      &lt;p&gt;As experienced astronauts, Williams and Wilmore probably would have responded positively to the delay, speculates Hadfield, who now writes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/The-Defector/dp/1529423104&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;thrillers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; set on Earth and in space.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“At the end of each of my spaceflights, if someone had said ‘you get another three months up there’—that would have been the best thing,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;NASA insists that Williams and Wilmore were technically not “stranded” in space, arguing that they expected the first Starliner flight to expose such problems.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;But there’s a long history of spacefarers who have spent more time than expected in space because of barriers in bringing them back to Earth. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/slideshow/brief-history-of-human-spaceflight-1961-to-present-feature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here’s a brief overview of human spaceflight since 1961&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The most famous case is that of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/missions/station/iss-research/down-to-earth-q-and-a-with-cosmonaut-sergei-krikalev/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sergei Krikalev&lt;/a&gt;, a cosmonaut on board the Mir space station during the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Krikalev had launched on May 18, 1991, from Baikonur in the Soviet Socialist Republic of Kazakhstan and planned to spend about 150 days on Mir. But the Soviet Union fell apart during his mission, and issues about who would pay for his return kept him in orbit for 311 days—a world record at the time.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes spacecraft encounter problems while docked at the ISS, as was the case for another extended ISS occupant, American astronaut Frank Rubio. Rubio and two Russian cosmonauts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/international-space-station-article&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;arrived at the ISS&lt;/a&gt; on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in September 2022, and they were scheduled to take the same spacecraft back in March 2023.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;But the Soyuz developed problems after it was struck by a micrometeoroid—a speck of dust or rock traveling extremely fast—and so Rubio &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/record-setting-nasa-astronaut-crewmates-return-from-space-mission/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;had to catch a ride&lt;/a&gt; on a different Soyuz in September later that year.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As a result, Rubio set a new record for the most time continuously spent in space by a NASA astronaut, of 371 days. However, that’s still shy of the overall record: Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov spent 437 consecutive days on board the Mir space station in 1994 and 1995. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/astronauts-space-earth-perspective&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Read about how time in space changes astronauts&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;Two American astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut were stuck on board the ISS in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.space.com/19436-columbia-disaster.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;February 2003, after the space shuttle Columbia disintegrated&lt;/a&gt; during its reentry to the atmosphere, killing all seven astronauts on board.&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;After the disaster, NASA suspended all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/space-shuttle-program&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;space shuttle flights&lt;/a&gt; until they could be made safe — a grounding that lasted more than two years—and so the shuttle Atlantis scheduled to bring the crew back to Earth in March couldn’t fly. Eventually all three spent an extra three months on the ISS, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/International_Space_Station/A_hard_but_safe_landing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;returning&lt;/a&gt; in May 2003 on a Russian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Launch_vehicles/The_Russian_Soyuz_spacecraft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Soyuz spacecraft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;For a time, Russia’s Soyuz was the only spacecraft that could dock with the ISS, and problems with it sometimes caused delays in changing the space station’s crews. This includes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/american-russian-alive-after-soyuz-rocket-headed-to-space-station-fails-on-launch/2018/10/11/b9f3ae88-cd36-11e8-920f-dd52e1ae4570_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MS-10 mission&lt;/a&gt;, which was aborted shortly after its launch in October 2018.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Such delays, however, are seldom detailed by the Russian space agency Roscosmos; and Hadfield says changes in space flight schedules happen all the time.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The most dramatic case of a space stranding was during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/mission/apollo-13/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apollo 13 mission in 1970&lt;/a&gt;, after an oxygen tank on the command module exploded just three days into its six-day journey to the moon and back.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The disaster threatened the lives of the three astronauts on board. But they were able to use their lunar lander as a lifeboat, ditching it for the heat-shielded command module just before reentry; and they splashed-down safely on 17 April, 1970—roughly 14 hours later than originally expected.&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;University of Southern California astronautics professor &lt;a href=&quot;https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Gruntman/Michael&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mike Gruntman&lt;/a&gt; says it is not usually an issue when astronauts have to spend more time in space than they expected.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;But staying in space for extended periods might be more dangerous for older astronauts, who could suffer from the effects of muscle-loss and bone-loss in a microgravity environment, he says. Now that Williams and Wimore have returned to Earth, NASA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/spaceflight-standard-measures-characterizing-how-humans-adapt-in-space/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;will collect data&lt;/a&gt; on how their bodies changed during their extended stay. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/space-human-body-astronaut-health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here’s what we know about how spaceflight impacts the human body&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;If anything, the Starliner situation exemplifies the ability of career astronauts to deal with problems.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;But it also shows how geopolitical issues can have an impact on spaceflight, he says, noting that the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine makes it “unrealistic” to consider an emergency Soyuz launch to bring the astronauts back.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Purdue University astronautical engineer &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.purdue.edu/IE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=5732&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Barrett Caldwell&lt;/a&gt; also sees the Starliner situation as a testament to the resilience of human spaceflight.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“The spaceflight community puts a tremendous additional burden of safety and management of risk on any vehicle which is designed for humans,” he says. “The recent decisions show how much we are living that reality.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In addition, exposing and overcoming technical issues is part of the plan for new spacecraft: “Since this is a first mission of an experimental vehicle, all of this is part of the development and evaluation process,” says Caldwell.&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;As for how the Starliner crew spent their extra time in space, Williams and Willmore effectively joined the existing space station crew, living and working in space. This included 150 science experiments, ranging from plant growth to stem cell studies. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Former NASA astronaut &lt;a href=&quot;https://astronauttomjones.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tom Jones&lt;/a&gt; speculated that NASA and its partners were probably &quot;glad to have the extra productivity onboard, with two extra brains and pairs of hands with which to conduct research and maintain the very complex ISS.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The ISS already stocks four months of emergency supplies for seven people, he noted. Several robot cargo ships also docked at the station during their time aboard, bringing extra supplies and personal items for the extra astronauts.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Any discomfort from an extended stay comes with the territory for career astronauts. “You don’t become an astronaut for comfort,” says Hadfield.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;And Williams and Wilmore spent much of their lives training for just this sort of eventuality: “This is like the best Christmas present they both could have,” he says. “I would trade places with them in a heartbeat.”&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Editor&#39;s note&lt;/b&gt;: This story was originally published on August 30, 2024, and was updated on March 18, 2025, to include the astronauts&#39; return to Earth from the ISS.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;   </description><link>https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/astronauts-stranded-space-starliner-history</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/astronauts-stranded-space-starliner-history</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 23:08:47 GMT</pubDate><author>Tom Metcalfe</author><category>Science</category></item><item><title>What toll does spaceflight take on astronauts?</title><description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.natgeofe.com/n/2ba83bd2-2fcf-45fb-87b9-29d7030451e3/Liftoff.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A long exposure of Inspiration4 launching, which appears as a golden arch of flaming light starting from the lower frame, extending upwards and away from the camera&#39;s perspective, out towards the ocean in the distance.&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;On September 15, 2021, a SpaceX Dragon capsule carried the Inspiration4 crew into space via a Falcon 9 rocket. During their three-day mission, spacecraft reached an altitude of 575 kilometers (km) above Earth’s surface, farther in space than the orbit of the International Space Station, which ranges from 370km to 460km.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new database aims to pave the way for a better understanding of space health and medicine as more civilian missions launch.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Over the past five decades, under 700 humans have flown in space. Nearly every one of those humans were professionally trained astronauts and in similar peak physical condition. And most of those astronauts were men. But in 2021, the first space mission with four civilian astronauts—meaning, not government agency astronauts—flew. It opened a new path for the scientists who study the effects of spaceflight on human biology.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;On June 11, 2024, more than 200 of those &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-024-00009-8/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;researchers published&lt;/a&gt; a suite of 44 papers across multiple &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; journals. These papers are helping to build a foundation, a baseline of sorts, to understand not just how being in space affects the human body but how scientists can mitigate those effects.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Humanity is a long way from being an interplanetary species, but this is “the very first step on what will be many steps to prepare for the Moon and Mars,” says Weill Cornell Medicine’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://vivo.weill.cornell.edu/display/cwid-chm2042&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Christopher Mason&lt;/a&gt;, the biophysicist and physician who led the data accumulation and analysis behind the papers.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;These data are also showing scientists how the human body reacts under extreme stress, both physically and cognitive. “We really need to know how the human condition reacts” to the radiation and the extreme acceleration forces, in addition to changes in the body’s circadian rhythm, or sleep cycle, says Stanford geneticist &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.stanford.edu/snyderlab/about.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Michael Snyder&lt;/a&gt; who was not involved in these recent papers. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As more humans make the journey to space, prepare for trips to the moon and beyond, or even get &#39;stuck&#39; like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/astronauts-stranded-space-starliner-history&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;career astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore&lt;/a&gt;, it&#39;s important to have a complete picture of the body&#39;s response. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;These varied studies show that just a few days in space affects biology in ways that don’t seem to reverse. And they’re starting to hint at differences between females and males.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;When human space missions took flight in the 1960s, space health investigations began. Apollo astronauts wore biosensor harnesses to monitor the heart and lungs and underwent thorough physical exams and tests preflight and postflight. The astronauts experienced back pain from microgravity, flashes of light from radiation, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19760005581/downloads/19760005581.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;other health changes&lt;/a&gt;. But this was just the start.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, the International Space Station (ISS) has served as an orbiting biological &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.issnationallab.org/research-on-the-iss/areas-of-research/life-sciences/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;laboratory&lt;/a&gt; to investigate everything from bacterial changes to bone loss to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/news-space-travel-brain-astronauts-body&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brain deformation&lt;/a&gt;. Then in 2015, biologists had the unique opportunity to better understand how the environment of space environment affects biology at the smallest scales. In an experiment NASA called the Twins Study, one astronaut, Scott Kelly, boarded the ISS for a year and his identical twin, Mark Kelly, who was also an astronaut, stayed on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;By directly comparing identical twins, biologists could study the genetic effects of space. When Scott returned to Earth, his telomeres, the ends of chromosomes that act to protect genetic material, had lengthened. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/study-of-astronaut-twins-hints-at-spaceflight-health-effects&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Read more about NASA’s Twins Study&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;But Scott Kelly was a sample size of only one space traveler. In addition, most astronauts in the &amp;nbsp;decades of previous scientific studies were U.S. or Russian men who had trained for years to make the trip to space. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;A 2021 SpaceX mission, Inspiration4, presented researchers with an opportunity &amp;nbsp;to study space health in more varied space travelers. The mission, called Inspiration4, would have four private astronauts, who collectively cover a wider variety of ages, ancestries, and biomedical backgrounds. “They are representative of a broader swath of humanity,” says Mason.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Mason and many of his colleagues on the new collection of papers had also worked on the Twins Study. The team already had a suite of experiments that had flown in space and that “had been validated up the wazoo, in astronauts” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.med.upenn.edu/uep/faculty_basner.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mathias Basner&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine who studies human behavior and cognition. The researchers would develop those tests further for the Inspiration4 mission, to study a broader collection of the human biological system. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The team examined blood, urine, stool, saliva, and sweat samples, in addition to skin biopsies. They also included behavior and cognitive set of tests, and sleep data. These tests were performed before flight, during flight, and post-flight. And all those data were inputted into a growing biometric database, known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://soma.weill.cornell.edu/#main&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA)&lt;/a&gt;, organized and maintained by Mason and his colleagues. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The catalog, published in June, includes detailed data collected over the past decade from dozens of NASA and Japanese Space Agency astronauts, 12 private space farers (where four were on the Inspiration4 mission), and a control group of 10 people who climbed Mount Everest. Researchers also used animal data from experiments aboard the ISS to better understand the effects of space on the body.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“We&#39;re now starting to get the sketches of what our baseline measurements, for bloodwork, for radiation, for what happens in genes and your immune system,” in spaceflight, says Mason.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;On September 15, 2021, just after 8pm EDT, the Inspiration4 mission launched with four civilian astronauts. Roughly three days later, the capsule and its crew splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Upon analyzing the data, one of the most surprising results, says Mason, was that “we saw a lot of the same signatures of spaceflight that we saw on longer missions.” That indicates there’s a “dosage” of spaceflight, that you can start to see in the body, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Like in the Twins Study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-024-06014-x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;telomeres lengthened&lt;/a&gt;, he says. The elongated telomeres (likely a result of radiation exposure, say the researchers) and related genes’ activation may help protect DNA from harmful radiation.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Many changes didn’t revert after returning to Earth’s surface even multiple months after they came back. “You’d think people would bounce back faster than they did,” says Snyder.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The Inspiration4 astronauts’ microbiomes also changed over only those few days. “It’s intriguing to see how quickly their skin becomes like each other and the spacecraft,” says Mason. While the crew’s skin microbes grew more similar, and their mouth microbes changed, the researchers didn’t see the same changes to their intestines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;While gene expression and microbiome changes are some of the microscopic scale effects of space, there are also macroscopic effects, including cognition and behavior. To test behavior and cognitive ability during flight, researchers looked at 10 intellectual and mental domains, says Basner, like memory, attention, abstraction, risk decision making, emotion recognition. “Our behavior is like a combination of all of these, but we try to disentangle that,” he says, to see if one of those domains are more effective than others.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.natgeofe.com/n/b8651bd7-fa9e-49e2-8034-0ad564c12f2c/walking_photo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The four crew members of Inspiration4 walking towards the camera.

The four crew members are in various states of tumbling through the air as they experience weightlessness.&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;During their three-day mission, the Inspiration4 crew (pictured on a Zero-G airplane) collected data to assess the impact of microgravity, radiation, isolation and other facets of the space environment on the human body. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;      &lt;p&gt;The Inspiration4 crew exhibited cognitive decline early into flight, and the average was driven mostly by one crew member, says Basner. Cognition leveled out during the rest of the flight and returned to normal once the crew returned to ground. Behavior-wise, the crew was a more positive post-flight, he adds. “But that just hinted to the fact that they were happy that they made it,” back to the ground safely.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;The SOMA database is open access, publicly available to biologists for their own research. “Everyone comes with their own perspective,” says Mason. “They see the biology through their own lens, and then see the questions with their own perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;That’s how &lt;a href=&quot;https://find-a-doctor.health.usf.edu/provider/Begum+Aydogan+Mathyk/2632819&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Begum Mathyk&lt;/a&gt;, a doctor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of South Florida, became involved. “It’s not much difference for me to, you know, advocate for women’s health on Earth or beyond,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Mathyk and her colleagues’ analysis of the Inspiration4 blood and urine samples showed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-05213-2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;changes to genes associated with the hormone estrogen&lt;/a&gt;, which is involved in the reproductive system but also in muscles, the brain, and other bodily systems. They found genetic changes to the way the estrogen-related reactions work in space, with more changes in the females’ B cells than in males. B cells are related to autoimmune diseases, which tend to affect women more than men. These hormone changes also affect the body’s responses to infections, says Mathyk.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Genes associated with how insulin regulates blood sugar also changed during those few days in space. “These changes suggest that spaceflight may impair metabolism and the immune system,” adds Mathyk. They noted other changes to immune cells, as well, and these changes took longer to return to normal in the males than in the females after the flight ended. These cells relate to how the body reacts to inflammation and some also relate to blood clotting.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;While the microbiology showed slight differences between males and females, there were no behavior or cognitive sex differences, says Basner.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Radiation can have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s44294-024-00009-z&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;negative effects on the ovaries and uterus&lt;/a&gt;, and maintaining sleep cycles in space is important for a functioning reproductive system, Mathyk and her colleagues stressed in a review paper looking at data from Inspiration4 crew, JAXA astronauts, and animals. Studies of mice and their embryos suggest space is an “unfavorable environment” for reproduction, she says. “But it&#39;s not easy to conclude or project all the data to the human, because we are more complex,” adds Mathyk.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Researchers will have more data soon. Mathyk is part of a proposal to fly a handheld ultrasound device on an upcoming SpaceX mission to image female reproductive organs, including the uterus and ovaries. And additional private and government missions are incorporating these tests.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Plus, the SOMA database is already growing. It now holds biological information from the private flights Axiom-2 and the pre-flight samples for Polaris Dawn, which is scheduled for launch this summer. Researchers will also add Axiom-3 data later this summer, says Mason.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Beyond simply understanding the biology of the human body in space, the atlas and the work that results could lead to ways to counteract these effects, including custom tailoring specific medications to someone’s genetic background. “There&#39;s a lot more coming,” says Mason.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Editor&#39;s note&lt;/b&gt;: This story was originally published on July 9, 2024.

Also doubling: The estimated lifetime risk of developing the condition, compared to previous estimates.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Figures like these can sound scary — and indeed, dementia projections carry some warnings. For one, they suggest the U.S. urgently needs to pour resources into growing its caregiving workforce to meet future needs. But paradoxically, this number also tells a success story.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Today, thanks to decades of social and medical progress, more Americans than ever are living long enough to get dementia; in the past, more people would have died of cardiovascular disease or cancer at earlier ages. These health advances have also delayed the condition’s onset for many people.&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most hopeful news about dementia is that there’s a lot people can do to lower their chances of developing it, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/4192/michael-fang&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Michael Fang&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and lead author of the recent study.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The new study hints at the potential disruption to families, caregivers, and the economy if nothing changes to reduce dementia risk, he says. “But if we &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; do something, there is an opportunity and a potential to bend the curve a little bit.”&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;This study is not the first to project that the number of Americans with dementia is on the rise. However, while past estimates placed the lifetime risk somewhere &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24418058/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;between&lt;/a&gt; 14 and 23 percent, the latest one suggests that more than 40 percent of Americans may develop the condition at some point in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;Some of that increase can be explained by the study’s participants, about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/atherosclerosis-risk-communities-aric-study&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;quarter&lt;/a&gt; of whom are Black (the U.S. as a whole is &lt;a href=&quot;http://percent/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; 14 percent Black).&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“There are lots of papers that show that non-whites have greater risk of getting dementia,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.ucsf.edu/kristine.yaffe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kristine Yaffe&lt;/a&gt;, a dementia researcher at the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In the U.S., the higher risk to non-white people stems from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10475144/#S18&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;poorer access&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to resources that prevent dementia — like high-quality education, healthy food, and safe outlets for physical activity — and higher smoking rates. For that reason, dementia projections based on data from a somewhat more racially diverse group will be higher than those based on a mostly white group, as most previous studies were.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;That said, this study’s participant pool doesn’t explain the entirety of its upgraded risk projections.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Two other big contributors do: More Americans than ever are living into their 80’s and 90’s and reaching the point where they’re more likely to experience cognitive changes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/dementia-brain-disease-diagnose-hard?cmpid=org=ngp::mc=social::src=twitter::cmp=editorial::add=tw20231023science-dementiahedcard&amp;amp;linkId=248563993&amp;amp;loggedin=true&amp;amp;rnd=1742394792454&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are the signs of dementia—and why is it so hard to diagnose?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of dementia cases occur in older adults. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/josef-coresh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Josef Coresh&lt;/a&gt;, the study’s senior author and founding director of the Optimal Aging Institute at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, four percent of American 75-year-olds have some form of the disease, and the risk increases steeply in the years that follow. Nearly 20 percent of 85-year-olds have dementia, and the risk continues to rise with every year that follows.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Americans are increasingly likely to reach those late life stages. While people born in the 1950’s could expect to live an average of 69 years, people born in the 2010’s can anticipate an additional decade of lifespan. Women’s lifespans are on average longer than men’s, and it’s in part for that reason that women are more likely to develop dementia at some point in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;Dementia isn’t on the rise because it’s getting harder to prevent — quite the opposite, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The advances that are allowing more Americans to reach old age are also delaying the onset of dementia for many people. In a room full of randomly selected 70, 80, or 90-year-old Americans, fewer would have dementia today than a similar sample of people 50 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Yaffe says that decrease in age-specific risk is largely due to improvements in many areas, including better cardiovascular health and education. Childhood education and cognitive stimulation over the life course are protective against dementia symptoms. &quot;All these things really changed a lot,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;These advances — along with lower rates of smoking and alcohol overuse, better air quality, improved treatment for depression, and other quality-of-life changes — likely explain why people who develop dementia today are getting it later in life than people who developed dementia in the 1970’s.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Some risk factors for dementia are not ones we can alter. Most notably, people who carry copies of the apoE gene in their DNA are at higher risk than others for Alzheimer disease, the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;common cause&lt;/a&gt; of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;However, many dementia risk factors are ones we can change.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Last year, a group of dementia experts published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/fulltext&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; listing 14 specific actions people can take to lower their risk across their lives. They include choices to make for children — like encouraging helmet use during sports to reduce brain injury risk— and choices for older adults, like treating vision and hearing loss, and seeking supportive living and social environments to reduce isolation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8266338/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8574768/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;have shown these actions&#39; protective effects can add up.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The Lancet Commission on Dementia &lt;a href=&quot;https://&amp;nbsp;https:/www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/fulltext&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; several specific actions across the life course to reduce dementia risk:&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;Patricia Crowley, who worked on the underlying dataset of the &lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt; study, made several of these changes after retiring about a decade ago. Her husband had been diagnosed years before with mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to dementia, and they both joined a local senior center after she stopped working. The strength training, tai chi, tech support, and book exchanges that soon filled their calendars weren’t just about staying busy, she says: “The friendship and the exercise” have been critical to their continued well-being.&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes can make a difference, but some of the most powerful&amp;nbsp;preventive interventions experts recommend are pharmaceutical: Medicines&amp;nbsp;to treat high blood pressure and cholesterol can be particularly useful in reducing risk. Some&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(24)00268-2/fulltext&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;early evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests GLP-1 inhibitors like semaglutide and tirzepatide (Ozempic and Wegovy) may be protective, perhaps due to their effects on brain inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;There’s also a lot of interest in understanding whether recently FDA-approved drugs like lecanemab (Leqembi) — which reduce brain buildup of amyloid, the chief culprit in causing Alzheimer disease — can prevent the condition in people who haven’t yet developed dementia symptoms, says Yaffe. Although scientists are currently trying to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01760005&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;answer this question&lt;/a&gt;, Yaffe doesn’t expect to see study results for five to ten years.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, stigma surrounding the diagnosis keeps many people from talking to their clinicians when they notice signs of memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;That’s a real shame, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=regina-shih-13123&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Regina Shih&lt;/a&gt;, a dementia epidemiologist at Emory University. “Dementia is not necessarily a death sentence,” she says. “There are a lot of things one can do, both in terms of preventing dementia and also what to do once you have a diagnosis of dementia.” However, patients might not get counseling on those actions if their providers aren’t aware they’re experiencing cognitive changes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Crowley’s awareness of dementia prevention measures helped her make good choices for herself and her husband.&amp;nbsp;They’re fortunate that for the moment, they don’t require advanced care, which has been in increasingly short supply as the elder care workforce has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2024/mar/addressing-shortage-direct-care-workers-insights-seven-states&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dwindled&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/why-the-new-alzheimers-drug-lecanemab-is-eliciting-both-optimism-and-caution?cmpid=org=ngp::mc=social::src=twitter::cmp=editorial::add=tw20230112science-newalzheimersdrug&amp;amp;linkId=197294917&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why the new Alzheimer’s drug is eliciting both optimism and caution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps just as important as Crowley’s knowledge was her ability to confront reality and make changes to adjust to it, a skill she acquired when she was diagnosed with a chronic eye condition in her early twenties, leaving her legally blind.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Early on, I realized that you can ruin your own life by not accepting things as they are,” she says – “and the accepting part is the part that makes the difference.”&lt;/p&gt;  </description><link>https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/rising-dementia-rates-reason-and-how-to-reduce-risk</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/rising-dementia-rates-reason-and-how-to-reduce-risk</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 23:08:47 GMT</pubDate><author>Keren Landman</author><category>Science</category></item><item><title>These fish can spot their favorite divers</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Several times during almost 20 years of conducting research on fish in the wild, Alex Jordan, a researcher who leads the Behavioural Evolution Lab at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, had the feeling that the fish he was studying were learning to recognize and follow him or his colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“There were a lot of times when it was obvious&amp;nbsp;to us that fish were recognizing us,” he recalls.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;But while scientists seemed to intuitively suspect this, no studies looked at this phenomenon in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“[Fish] are a lot more complicated than we give them credit for,” says Cait Newport, a marine biologist at Oxford University who wasn’t involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;To test their hunch, Jordan and his colleagues traveled to the French Mediterranean island of Corsica, where they designed experiments involving two different fish species: saddled sea bream (&lt;i&gt;O. melanura&lt;/i&gt;) and black sea bream (&lt;i&gt;S. cantharus&lt;/i&gt;)—two common species in the Mediterranean Sea. For a month, the team conducted more than 30 dives between 13 and 26 feet deep.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The results of their study, recently published in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2024.0558&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Biology Letters&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggest fish could recognize individual divers by the color of the gear, similar to how divers often recognize each other when their faces and other body parts are obscured by scuba equipment.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;As a first step, a researcher and student on Jordan’s team, Katinka Soller, trained fish to follow her, conducting 23 dives over 12 days.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;She did so by wearing a colorful vest and floating in place for five minutes while feeding the fish shrimp slices. Then, she swam for 160 feet in a straight direction and rewarded the fish that followed her with more food. After the 10th dive she gradually stopped feeding the fish and wearing the colorful vest. An average of 13 fish learned to follow her.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;To learn whether the fish were actually recognizing a specific diver, and not just following divers in general, the team performed a second experiment, where two researchers wearing different colored diving gear entered the waters, Soller and doctoral student Maëlan Tomasek, also from Jordan’s team. Both divers floated in the same spot for three minutes before swimming in opposite directions.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;At the end of the 160-foot swim, the first diver rewarded the fish with food, while the other didn’t. This portion of the experiment lasted 10 days, for a total of 5 dives.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;On the first day of this experiment, the fish followed both divers, but they gradually&amp;nbsp;learned to follow the researcher that rewarded them with food—suggesting that they could learn to tell the two divers apart.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In the final experiment, the divers repeated the routine while wearing identical suits.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;This time, the fish couldn’t recognize the diver that had been feeding them and began following both again. This suggests they used the different colors of diving gear to tell the two divers apart and follow the one that gave them food.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“You might then say, ‘well, that&#39;s because they&#39;re stupid fish, right? They only look at the visual appearance of the divers’,” says Jordan. But when underwater, he notes, scuba divers usually do the same thing, using the color of their gear to recognize each other.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;Jordan says fish evolved the ability to link a certain stimulus to a reward. That’s how they might be learning “to associate a particular human that they recognize through visual means with a certain outcome.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/archerfish-animal-cognition-intelligence-human-faces-news?loggedin=true&amp;amp;rnd=1742311166570&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; on fish intelligence have been mostly done in the lab, and one study published by Newport in 2018 showed that at least one species of fish could recognize 3D renderings of human faces.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Newport says the idea of testing fish intelligence in the wild, where those animals naturally live, “is actually really quite new, and [the study authors] should be commended for doing that.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;But while it’s possible that fish could learn to recognize individual humans’ traits, that’s not what this study shows, stresses Bryan Neff, a fish ecologist at the University of Western Ontario who wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As the researchers demonstrates, says Neff, the fish are using a visual cue, a color in the divers’ suit. “And honestly, there&#39;s nothing particularly novel about that.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/220/16/2887/33559/Behavioral-color-vision-in-a-cichlid-fish&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.26.356089v2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that some species of fish “can pick up on color and that they have a reaction to that color,” Neff adds.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;While the new study offers fresh clues on whether and how fish might recognize us, it also leaves open questions for future research.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As a next step, Jordan and his team want to test whether fish can learn to recognize human’s attributes, such as the hairs, eyes and face, which usually allow us humans “to differentiate amongst each other”.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, this new study could also have implications for researchers studying fish in the wild. If the animals can recognize and follow specific scientists, they might accidentally bias the results of experiments, avoiding teams that perform certain more stressful&amp;nbsp;experiments, while interacting more with researchers that for example give them food rewards, says Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“We have to be really careful with how we work underwater when we realize it&#39;s not just us observing them. It&#39;s them observing us.”&lt;/p&gt;  </description><link>https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/fish-recognize-people-divers-color</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/fish-recognize-people-divers-color</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 23:08:47 GMT</pubDate><author>Gennaro Tomma</author><category>Animals</category></item><item><title>Explore 7 of the best pilgrimages in the UK</title><description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.natgeofe.com/n/7a7859e9-dc51-4824-9234-71286c746cb8/MourneMountains_LEAD_GettyImages-1811350811_RESIZED.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A single man walking through the vast and flat landscape at the foot of a low-reaching mountain.&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Mourne mountains offer a fantastic pitstop on the St Patrick&#39;s Way in Northern Ireland.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;While traditional religious practices may be on the decline, pilgrimages — meditative, multi-day hikes — are experiencing a resurgence. Explore the routes that are offering new, mindful journeys in our increasingly secular world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;This article was produced by &lt;i&gt;National Geographic Traveller &lt;/i&gt;(UK).&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Back in the day, a pilgrimage meant a journey to a sacred place as an act of religious devotion. Today, for increasing numbers of pilgrims, it’s a journey made with purpose and a touch of spirituality — though not necessarily driven by faith. The UK has become one of the world’s most secular countries; the last census saw the percentage of Christians in England and Wales drop from 59% to 46%. And yet the country is leading the way in revitalising pilgrim trails — from church-hopping around rural Herefordshire to routes spanning the Irish Sea.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Simply put, making a pilgrimage hasn’t been this popular since the Middle Ages. But why? As the world becomes ever more complicated, taking time out for a long walk — when all you have to think about is food, shelter and putting one foot ahead of the other — is increasingly appealing. A pilgrimage is wellness at its simplest, and an antidote to fast-paced 21st-century life.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;The Golden Valley Pilgrim Way doesn’t get you anywhere. Unusually for a pilgrimage, this 60-mile route is not linear but a loop, winding through rolling, rural, time-warp southwest Herefordshire to finish back where it started, at the door of Hereford’s 11th-century cathedral. But it’s a journey that provokes spiritual contemplation. Night sanctuary is offered at nine churches en route (suggested donation: £20 per person per night), offering camp beds, access to a toilet and sink, and the privilege of bunking down in sacred, historic, community-rooted spaces. These include Madley Church, which has been attracting pilgrims since the sixth century (St Dubricius was reputedly born here), and St Clydawg’s in Clodock, rich in intriguing ecclesiastical details and located near to the characterful Cornewall Arms pub. There’s also the chance to sleep in the cloisters of Hereford Cathedral, thought to be the first British cathedral to allow pilgrims to stay since medieval times.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.natgeofe.com/n/66d65698-a193-4f52-ae1b-9989a8afc305/EildonHills_GettyImages-2017155673_RESIZED.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A landscape shot overlooking bushy and green hills, with flowers and fields in the distance.&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;undefined&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.natgeofe.com/n/cd8bcbbe-e4f2-4ae3-89fa-74234c7d2466/EildonHills_GettyImages-2017156197_RESIZED.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A wooden footpath sign attached to a wooden fence on the top of a green hill.&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;undefined&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;        &lt;p&gt;Tracing the footsteps of its namesake seventh-century saint, the 62-mile St Cuthbert’s Way runs from the Scottish Borders town of Melrose, where St Cuthbert entered monastic life, to Holy Island, his eventual resting place and original shrine. It’s perhaps the godfather of modern British pilgrimages: the trail opened in 1996 and has become beloved of both pilgrims and seasoned ramblers who rate its manageable distance, wild and varied terrain, lower-key status and historic significance.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;En route lie the distinctive Eildon Hills, the burbling River Tweed, ruined abbeys, the remote Cheviots and St Cuthbert’s Cave where, it’s said, the saint’s body was hidden in 875 during Viking raids. The trail delivers one of the finest finales, too: the walk to Holy Island, either across the causeway or over the tidal mudflats — many make the journey barefoot — to reach the ruins of Lindisfarne Priory, where St Cuthbert was made bishop in 685.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;Remarkably, a pilgrimage celebrating Ireland’s patron saint only launched in 2015. It was the brainchild of an Irishman — artist and pilgrim Alan Graham — who’d walked Spain’s Camino de Santiago and thought there should be something similar back home. The 82-mile route links the ceremonial site of Navan Fort, on the outskirts of Armagh, and the town of Downpatrick — two places with the strongest links to the man who brought Christianity to Ireland. Patrick chose Armagh to be the seat of the new religion, founding his main church there in 445 CE. Downpatrick is where he allegedly built his first church, and where he’s believed to be buried.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Along the way, the well-signed trail traverses green and glorious countryside, follows canals, enters the mighty Mourne Mountains, veers into seaside Newcastle, runs through Murlough Bay Nature Reserve and passes ruined Dundrum Castle. Walkers can carry a pilgrim’s passport, collecting stamps along the way to earn a certificate from Downpatrick’s Saint Patrick Centre.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;It was around the sixth century when saints first went to spread Christianity across England’s southwesterly extreme. And the Cornish Celtic Way is a modern take on their ancient journeys. The 125-mile route, linking St Germans and St Michael’s Mount, passes evidence of those early Christians, from Celtic crosses to holy wells. It also traverses the wild moorlands, woodlands and cliff-backed shores that made them feel so close to God.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The trail combines 60 miles of Cornish coast path with two existing pilgrim trails. The Saints Way, from Padstow to Fowey, follows the likely route pilgrims once used to travel from Ireland and Wales to France and passes ancient footbridges and medieval churches. St Michael’s Way is a shortcut across the county from Lelant to the castle-crowned tidal isle of St Michael’s Mount. A trail passport enables walkers to collect stamps en route and book discounted accommodation, including stays in churches and church halls.&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;The tagline of this trail, ‘two Celtic lands, two Celtic saints, one transformative journey,’ perfectly encapsulates its 162-mile route, which spans both land and sea, retracing the sixth-century journey of St Aidan to meet St David — an encounter that saw Celtic culture bloom. The journey begins with a 62-mile walk through County Wexford, from the holy well in Ferns to the port of Rosslare, followed by a 62-mile crossing of the Irish Sea and a 37-mile stretch along the Welsh coast, from Goodwick Harbour to the picturesque city of St Davids. The trail is divided into nine stages (five in Ireland, four in Wales), with guided events available. The Welsh section follows the signposted Pembrokeshire Coast Path, complemented by a digital map for navigation.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;This adventure is imbued with ancient echoes, passing many pilgrim sites. These include St David’s Well near Oilgate; Our Lady’s Island, a place of female worship; a hermit’s cell at the foot of Garn Fawr; the Neolithic burial stone of Carreg Samson; and the summit of Carn Llidi, where angels allegedly told St Patrick to return to Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;The Old Way, a 240-mile pilgrimage from Southampton to Canterbury, blends history from both 2020 and the 14th century. Inspired by a red line on the Gough Map (circa 1360), the oldest known road map of Britain, the route was revived by the British Pilgrimage Trust, a charity dedicated to promoting and modernising the cultural and spiritual significance of this ancient form of travel.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The route takes between two and four weeks to complete, following a slightly altered path from the original red line to avoid modern highways and connect key pilgrimage sites. These include the ruins of Titchfield Abbey, magnificent Chichester Cathedral, the ancient trackways of the South Downs and a series of medieval churches and mystical natural locations, from quiet forests to eerie marshlands. Along the way, low-cost accommodation is available at various sanctuaries, from churches and community centres to camping fields. These options offer reasonable prices for pilgrims while providing revenue for local communities.&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;Launched in 2021, the six Northern Saints Trails follow the paths of those who made northeast England the heart of Christianity in medieval Britain. For example, the 29-mile Way of Life, from Gainford to Durham, is steeped in the stories of St Cuthbert, the former bishop of Lindisfarne, whose remains were brought to Durham Cathedral in the ninth century. This route passes St Oswald’s Church, where Cuthbert is said to have performed a miracle, as well as Escomb, the oldest complete Saxon church in England.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The Way of Learning, a 38-mile route from Jarrow to Durham, follows the path of the Venerable Bede, one of the greatest Anglo-Saxon scholars, whose shrine has been in Durham Cathedral since the 14th century.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Way of Love, a 28-mile route from Durham to Hartlepool, highlights three of English Christianity’s most significant female figures: St Hilda, St Helena and St Mary Magdalene. In addition to these trails, the 22-mile Finchale Camino Inglés, from Finchale Priory to Gainford, is recognised as the English section of the Camino de Santiago. It was from Finchale that St Godric set out in the 12th century as the first recorded British pilgrim to Santiago de Compostela.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;To subscribe to&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;National Geographic Traveller&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;(UK) magazine click &lt;a href=&quot;https://checkout.natgeotraveller.co.uk/offers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Time here is marked not by the clock, but by the changing of the seasons. Though cruising is a popular way to explore, travelling by land allows more exposure to the wild landscapes of south-central Alaska, from the glaciers of Prince William Sound to a park where travellers can walk with bears.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;This article was produced by &lt;i&gt;National Geographic Traveller &lt;/i&gt;(UK).&lt;/p&gt;           &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.natgeofe.com/n/92786bac-a814-4f52-adde-7516ff3afb89/Alaska_NGT_MarisaMarulli-11_ukHR_RESIZED.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A woman hiking through a forest over big roots on the ground.&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;After hiking in Chugach State Park, just east of Anchorage, where trails weave between hemlock and spruce trees, it’s onwards to Lake Clark National Park.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.natgeofe.com/n/4a0f45a8-82b8-4184-a67f-234fbb40046a/Alaska_NGT_MarisaMarulli-14_ukHR_RESIZED.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A grizzly bear pacing down a river with low weeds and a forest in the background.&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Reached via a small ‘tundra tyre’ plane, it’s a rare place where travellers can get relatively close to grizzlies in the wild, accompanied by bear biologists.

This is one factor that likely contributes to unconscious bias against studying female birds.&amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientists just recently decided to study female birds. What they found astounded them. &amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Did you know female birds can sing?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;That might sound like a simple statement—an obvious statement—but just a little over a decade ago, most scientists viewed birdsong as trait that belonged nearly exclusively to male birds. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;This is just one of many ways scientists have historically short-changed female birds, researchers argue in a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ibi.13386&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;i&gt;International Journal of Avian Science&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“People tend to have an unconscious bias towards male birds, and that’s often because they’re brighter and easier to identify,” says lead author &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.morgantingley.com/people/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Joanna Wu&lt;/a&gt;, an ornithologist and ecologist at the University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Of course, in some species, such as crows, females and males are indistinguishable at a glance, making studying differences between the sexes even more difficult.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;These biases echo similar ones in human studies and could impact efforts to save species from threats like climate change and habitat destruction.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Without females, you’re really missing a large part of the population, and a pretty important part of the population for survival,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.karanodom.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Karan Odom&lt;/a&gt;, a behavior ecologist at the University of the Pacific, who was not involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;Overlooking female birds in research “can have real conservation consequences,” says Wu. As an example, she points to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/the-case-of-the-golden-winged-warbler&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;golden-winged warblers&lt;/a&gt;. The female birds inhabit lower-elevation habitats than males outside of the breeding season. Rather than simply being a quirk of warbler biology, this behavioral difference has real world impacts, because lower-elevation habitats are easier to log.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;While conservation efforts focused on the males’ habitat, one &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019BCons.24008266B/abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that, in a span of just 16 years, female golden-winged warblers lost twice as much non-breeding habitat as males.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;When scouring the scientific literature for their perspective piece, Wu and her colleagues—all members of a birdwatching group called &lt;a href=&quot;https://femalebirdday.wordpress.com/162-2/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Galbatross Project&lt;/a&gt;, which communicates the importance of female birds—also found a number of other interesting and understudied patterns.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I was surprised to find studies are consistently finding females disperse farther than males do,” says Wu.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;And this finding may be linked with another.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Study after study consistently finds that female birds have a lower survival rate,” says Wu.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Take a bird flying from the United States to Panama as part of its yearly migration. If female birds fly even slightly farther than males, that’s more time spent in the crosshairs of predators, more energy expended, and more risk of starvation.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Differences between the sexes may also make female birds more susceptible to landscape-scale changes, such as climate change. And all of these factors are likely to have knock-on effects for the population.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I think there’s a lot of value in realizing where our knowledge gaps are,” says Odom, who worked on the 2014 &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4379&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that determined not only that female birdsong was widespread across species, but also that it goes back the beginning of the birds’ family tree.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“If you care about birds, bird behavior, and bird conservation, I think it’s important to be recognizing that we might’ve missed some things,” says Odom. “And in this case, that happens to be females.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/why-some-female-hummingbirds-masquerade-as-males&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why do some female hummingbirds masquerade as males?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;If all of this sounds a bit familiar, it’s probably because there’s been a similar pattern in human-focused &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/women-science-sexism-research&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;science&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/womens-health-concerns-are-dismissed-more-studied-less-feature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It’s not surprising to me,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1245483270/elizabeth-comen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Comen&lt;/a&gt;, a medical oncologist at NYU Langone Health and author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drelizabethcomen.com/book&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;All in Her Head: The Truth and Lies Early Medicine Taught Us About Women&#39;s Bodies and Why It Matters Today&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Whether it’s culture, society, academics, or intellectual pursuits, [these things] are framed by those who are in positions of leadership and have the capacity and the resources to ask the questions. And for so long, those areas were dominated by men,” says Comen. “And that legacy pervades all sorts of intellectual investigation, whether it be medicine, anthropology, or animal behavior.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;For example, in humans, females can suffer from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/autoimmune-disease-common-women&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;different diseases than males&lt;/a&gt;, or a disease may present differently between the sexes. And as with the golden-winged warblers, studying both is necessary to ensure the health of the population overall.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“If we understand why women live longer, but in poorer health, that impacts not only the health of women, but helps us understand how to improve the health of men,” says Comen. “So this really is not either-or, but really, it’s how can we align together to improve the health of everybody in society.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/womens-health-breakthroughs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;We’re finally studying women’s bodies. Here’s what we’re learning&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;When it comes to birds, there is both good and bad news.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“One thing that most excites me about this paper is that there are solutions that we can pretty easily implement,” says Wu. “And the first and foremost is we just have to recognize that there are sex differences.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In addition to increased awareness of the problem, other steps forward include training scientists and the public on how to better identify female birds, as well as utilizing blood, feather, and DNA samples to sex species that are more difficult to parse.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Studies and surveys can also better account for the way the sexes may use different habitats in both space and time—such as focusing on capturing birds during the migration season, when both sexes are active, rather than the mating season, when females may already be spending more time at a nest.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Making an effort to investigate birds outside of North America and Europe, which is where most studies have historically taken place, will also be key, says Wu. This is because many tropical songbirds are socially monogamous, which tends to be an indicator of species with female singing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Funding also impacts which birds get studied, and in the U.S., that future is unclear. The Trump administration recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00365-z&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;instructed the National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which funds a lot of basic science research including studies on birds, to flag words such as “female” when reviewing grant applications—a move that will almost definitely hinder research of females, be they birds or humans.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“My deepest hope for all of our health is that we are less divided and more united, and recognizing that everybody in society deserves just, fair, and ethical quality healthcare,” says Comen. “We cannot have that without examining that which is similar between us, but also that which is different.”&lt;/p&gt;  </description><link>https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/female-bird-research-sex-bias</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/female-bird-research-sex-bias</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 23:08:47 GMT</pubDate><author>Jason Bittel</author><category>Animals</category></item><item><title>The best view of the northern lights involves a lot of travel—but it is so worth it</title><description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.natgeofe.com/n/67ba8337-25e4-4e3a-af91-abb51a2f7d21/AM_250129_Arctic_Experience_Norway_0520.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Northern Lights fill the sky with green above mountains and a small lodge in the corner of the frame.&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Peak northern lights viewing in northern Norwary typically happens between November and February.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The aurora borealis has jumped to the top of many travelers&#39; wish lists, creating a tourism boom in the northernmost reaches of our planet. This writer found a unique experience in northern Norway.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;There are somewhere around one septillion stars in the universe. On a clear night in the middle of a quiet birch forest in northern Norway, it feels as if you can see every single one of them. Tiny dots of starlight on a spectrum of brightness dotted every corner of the night sky in a celestial show that, for me, has only been rivaled by what I’ve seen in the middle of the American desert, far removed from any source of light.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;However, I wasn’t in northern Norway just to stargaze (though that was one of the major perks). I was one of eight guests of Klättermusen Experiences, a new offshoot of the 50-year-old Swedish high-end outdoor outfitter, Klättermusen, whose focus is on sustainable adventure travel. The plan was to spend a few days ski touring and a few days dogsledding, and if we were lucky, we would see the aurora borealis, the astral phenomenon that has helped build an entire tourism industry in the northernmost reaches of our planet.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;After four flights (Raleigh-Durham to Boston to Reykjavik to Oslo to Alta), I arrived in Alta, a small commune in the Finnmark region that calls itself “the city of the northern lights.” From there, it was still a 90-minute drive to our final destination: The tiny village of Langfjordbotn, population 114. This is where we (me and seven other travelers) would spend the week in two small lodges at the edge of the Langfjorden, a long, slender tributary of the much larger Altafjord. We were four degrees above the Arctic Circle and, less than a week before we arrived, the sun made its first appearance since late November.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The northern lights, however, took a few more days.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/what-to-pack-for-northern-lights-trip&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Related: Going on a northern light&#39;s trip? Here&#39;s what to pack&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;To the uninitiated (read: me), ski touring is a subgenre of the sport that involves skiing up the mountain before riding down. To ski up, you attach skins — adhesive strips of mohair — to the bottom of your skis. The tiny hairs dig into the snow, giving you enough traction to glide your skis along the snow, zig-zagging your way up the mountain. It’s an extraordinarily simple yet magnificently effective invention.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As I had never skied before, my hosts sourced me a splitboard, which is basically a snowboard that you can separate in two and essentially turn them into skis for the trip up the mountain before reattaching them to snowboard down (which &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;something I’ve been doing for three decades).&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;We were guided by Tore and Vegard Karlstrøm, the father-and-son team who own and operate the local arctic adventure company Spor Guiding. Tore is a leading avalanche expert, while Vegard coaches the Icelandic national cross-country team. Like many Norwegians, both appear to have been born with skis attached to their feet. At one point, while Vegard was trying to help someone who was having an issue with her boots, one of his skis went rogue and slid almost entirely down the mountain. No problem. He simply skied down several hundred meters on a single ski, retrieved his lost plank, and climbed back to the group in little more than a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The first full day of our trip found us skinning up a 600-meter mountain, stopping halfway for lunch at a plateau where the view included several fjords, countless peaks, a massive, domed glacier, and an island where Tore told us a Viking cemetery had recently been discovered.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;By the time we resumed our trip and reached the peak of the mountain, the sun had set, forcing us to illuminate our powerful headlamps so we might see on our way down. It was 2:45 in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The following day, we climbed a bigger mountain with a steeper ascent that was more technical, and far more demanding. However, the prize at the top was somehow even more rewarding than the day before. From the summit, we saw more mountains, glaciers, valleys, and fjords. We also had an unobstructed view of the section of the fjords that open up toward the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;But the view this day was punctuated by the sunset (again, at around 3 p.m.). The clouds were breaking and the low winter sun painted everything in a muted pink-orange, giving the white land and its gray seas a stunning pastel hue.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;We skied back down the mountain and drove back to our little fjord-side lodge, our eyes fixed on the dark, spellbinding sky. Those &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/#:~:text=Astronomers%20estimate%20that%20the%20universe,-studied%20star,%20the%20Sun.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;septillion stars&lt;/a&gt; were eminently visible and our hopes for a celestial show — which, to that point, had been obscured by cloudy skies — were high.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As we arrived home, a small, dull light was thickening over the peak that rose behind our lodge. Our group rushed out to the ice-covered road that led to our house, all of our necks craned skyward.&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;Within minutes, thick ribbons of brilliant green and purple spread out above us, punctuating the flicker of seemingly every star in the known universe. At one point, the aqua particles exploded in bloom over our heads, creating something that looked like a dome, or perhaps the falling embers of a fireworks. But when we looked up again, the dome had morphed into something else entirely. Something photos of the northern lights can’t capture is just how fast they move and reappropriate themselves into something wholly different. The lights are kinetic, almost as if they are living creatures swimming languidly through the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The show lasted about an hour. Maybe more, maybe less. We were too busy marveling at the phenomenon to keep track of time. And when it finally ended, we returned to our lodge for a dinner of minke whale and blueberry soup.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/how-to-photograph-the-northern-lights-according-to-an-expert&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Related: How to photograph the northern lights, according to an expert&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;After a lifetime spent in civilization, where we bend the earth to our will, drawing roads and passes, neighborhoods and entire cities onto the once uninhabited, it’s a marvel to travel over the contours of the land as they’ve been built over hundreds of millions of years. The trails we traversed exist because they’re the easiest route through the wilderness. Not because they’re the shortest distance between point A and point B. Up here, it’s sometimes hard to believe there even is an A and a B. As half-a-dozen Alaskan huskies pulled me through the Finnmark wilderness, I couldn’t help but consider the geography and the topography of the land beneath my sled’s skids. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;For two days, we were guests of Marianne Skjøthaug and Arne Karlstrøm&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;at their remote sled dog farm,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Parken Gård Husky.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The couple are two of the best sled dog racers on earth, having won world championships and some of the most prestigious races in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/humans-dogs-sledding-together-ten-thousand-years&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Related: Humans and dogs have been sledding together for nearly 10,000 years&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;For two days, Arne and Marianne guided us on how to drive a sled, the quirks of each dog’s role and personality, the rules and etiquette of sled dog racing, and whatever other information they could fill us with. At one point, halfway through our second day, we stopped at a remote cabin, no bigger than a small studio apartment, where they had coffee and hot chocolate, sausages to cook over an open fire their son Isaac had built, and a wraparound “couch” surrounding the fire, cut straight out of the snow and covered with animal pelts, so that we might rest our weary legs.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;All the while, our teams of dogs dug tiny trenches into the frozen ground, where they would burrow and rest, waiting patiently for our lunch to end. And as soon as it did, they all shot up, tugging at the lines, barking and howling and baying, anxious for us to untie their sleds from nearby trees, so that they might keep running across the frozen land.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Imagine that moment when you grab your dog’s leash and she starts going crazy. Now multiply that by 70.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;On our final night, as our group crowded around a pair of long tables in the attic-turned-rustic dining room of our lodge, our phones buzzed simultaneously with an alert. One of our guides was outside and she alerted our group thread that, after another cloudy night or two, the blue-green-pink ribbons of the aurora borealis appeared to be returning.&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;We put down our forks and pulled on our coats before rushing outside to the frozen walkway in front of our small lodge. And there, once again, were the undulating strips of light, their edges seeming to fade away into the night sky with little semblance of definition.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;We took more photos as we laughed, hooted, and hollered at the phenomenon unfurling over our heads. And then, seemingly quicker than the first time, the lights were gone and all that was left in the clear night sky were those septillion stars.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was almost as if, with a return drive to Alta awaiting us the following morning and a handful of flights to get back to the U.S., the cosmos were waving goodbye. Or, maybe if we’re lucky, it was more of a “see you soon.”&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kmexperiences.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Klättermusen Experiences&lt;/a&gt; offers fully curated adventure-travel experiences throughout the year in a variety of landscapes.

Peak northern lights viewing typically happens between November and February.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to stay:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you’re staying in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/northern-norway/alta/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alta&lt;/a&gt;, the family-owned &lt;a href=&quot;https://fjord-gjestegaard-spa.norway-hotel.com/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Altafjord Gjestegaard&lt;/a&gt; offers cushy and comfortable rooms and lounges, a sauna, and a delicious local breakfast for around $175 per night.

Whether filmed on location or on elaborate Hollywood sets, the original, real-life locations haven’t changed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Travelers can relive the nostalgia of the famous movie and the places featured&amp;nbsp;in its unforgettable scenes—such as the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amishgazebos.com/the-sound-of-music-gazebo/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gazebo&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;where Liesl von Trapp sings “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwK_WOXjfc0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;16 going on 17&lt;/a&gt;” or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nonnberg.at/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nonnberg Abbey&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;where the nuns discuss &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-VRyQprlu8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;how to solve a problem like Maria&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; Here’s how fans can celebrate the 60th anniversary of&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Sound of Music&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;this year and beyond.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;Of the 16 most famous locations,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salzburg.info/en/salzburg/the-sound-of-music/shooting-locations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;12 are in Salzburg city&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;two (the village in the opening scenes and the church where the real Trapp couple gets married) are in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salzburgerland.com/en/the-film-locations/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Salzkammergut&lt;/a&gt;, while two (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untersberg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Untersberg mountain&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;from “Climb Ev’ry Mountain” and the famous picnic scene in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/werfen-austria-sound-of-music-location-nature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Werfen&lt;/a&gt;) are in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://traveltoaustria.info/salzburgerland/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Salzburg State&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Fans can arrange the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.panoramatours.com/en/salzburg/tour/original-sound-of-music-tour-tour-1a-28&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Original Sound of Music Tour&lt;/a&gt;, where people are escorted to all the major film locations on a bus. The owner of Panorama Tours, Stefan Herzel, explains his unique connection to the movie. “Back in 1964, we transported everyone—actors, crew, equipment … everything. So, it was natural to start doing tours. We transported Julie Andrews when she came back in 1987, and the actors playing the children for the BBC’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;[which documented the search for the right Maria for the musical adaptation] in 2006.”&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;On this trip down memory lane, some travelers may find it hard to stifle spontaneous singing on the group excursions.

Bus tours and other indoor experiences are available year-round. It’s recommended to book in advance, especially when visiting during peak season because tours and other experiences fill up fast.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Wheelchair accessibility can be challenging because of the protected historical nature of Salzburg’s buildings.

Can it inspire the world?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Growing up in Thailand’s northeastern Isan region, Suwimon Chantajohn learned from her grandfather which insects were best to eat. Captivated by his stories of surviving on bugs during his military service in World War II, she spent her childhood scouring the dry fields for crickets, bamboo worms, and scarab beetles hiding in the grass, under bark, or beneath cow dung.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As an adult, she wanted to start her own business and traveled the world. While visiting a game lodge in Tanzania, a German guest screamed when Chantajohn brushed a bug off her arm. The moment sparked an idea. Back in Thailand, she launched Siam Bugs, a cricket farming business.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Today, her farm, tucked away in a quiet neighborhood outside Pattaya, is part of Thailand’s thriving edible insect industry, home to over 20,000 cricket farms. As a member of a cooperative of 18 local farms, her operation produces seven tons of crickets annually. Inside a warehouse the size of an airplane hangar, rows of crickets chirp through their 45-day lifecycle, sustained by a diet of grain, corn, and rice bran. “I feel like the mother of crickets,” Chantajohn says.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.natgeofe.com/n/1958aabb-d165-44e7-9575-5842937da5d7/MM10337_241207_09644.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A person wearing a dark blue top and a headlamp is pouring water into light blue tubes inside of a large container filled with crickets.&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A worker provides water to African crickets (&lt;i&gt;Gryllus bimaculatus&lt;/i&gt;) at Srichana Cricket Farms in Rayong, Thailand.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.natgeofe.com/n/9f384e2c-8119-4ad8-8d34-372f5dde2f86/MM10337_241208_16878.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Two pairs of hands reach into a large container shaking crickets from large egg cartons. The large container is filling up with small crickets.&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Workers shake house crickets (&lt;i&gt;Acheta domesticus&lt;/i&gt;) from milk cartons inside a containment pond&amp;nbsp;before a harvest at Siam Bugs Farm in Pattaya City, Chonburi, Thailand.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;      &lt;p&gt;Rural communities in Thailand have long foraged insects as a vital source of protein. But much of this traditional practice has shifted to commercial farming, positioning Thailand as a global leader in edible insect production. Farms producing crickets and other insects now supply international pet food markets, while restaurants are reshaping how the bugs are added to various foods and even placing them on high-end menus.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Edible insects have long been promoted as nutritious and environmentally friendly, with the potential to transform global agriculture. But mainstream acceptance, especially in western societies, has remained limited, largely due to the “ick” factor of chowing down on bugs. But that could be changing, experts say, as Thailand leads the way in sustainable insect farming. “I think they can set an example for the rest of the world,” says Arnold van Huis, a professor of tropical entomology at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/how-singapore-is-embracing-edible-insects&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here&#39;s how Singapore is embracing edible insects, too&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;Entomophagy, or eating insects, dates back to biblical times and is practiced by up to two billion people worldwide. Insects are packed with protein, fats, and other compounds that have been linked to various health benefits. For example, the fiber chitin that forms their exoskeletons helps with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/immune-response-eating-chitin-linked-better-health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-023-00728-7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; health.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In Thailand, home to over 200 edible insect species—second only to Mexico—bug-eating is most common in the rural north and northeastern regions, where insects serve as an abundant meat substitute. “People&amp;nbsp; can go into the field and collect them, and it doesn’t cost any money,” says Natapot Warrit, an entomologist at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Many markets offer a variety of wriggling and still beetles, crickets, ants, caterpillars, and cicadas. Popular dishes include buttery bamboo caterpillars; giant water bugs, whose musky scent resembles blue cheese; and red ant eggs, a key ingredient in the springtime curry dish “Gaeng Kai Mot Daeng.” In the south, cockchafers—large seasonal beetles—often fetch prices higher than chicken or pork.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.natgeofe.com/n/80164114-3c5f-4dbd-b5bc-82c910215b41/MM10337_241210_22526.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A close-up of a man biting into a big, brown insect on a fork.&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A customer at Akkee eats a deep-fried sago worm, larvae of Asian palm weevil (&lt;i&gt;Rhynchophorus ferrugineus&lt;/i&gt;) beetles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.natgeofe.com/n/6e942879-b0a3-439a-8efd-b2338481fd5e/MM10337_241210_22804.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A hand holding out a metal strainer with insects prepared to eat inside over a dark wood counter.&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cicadas are prepared for serving in the kitchen at Akkee.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;      &lt;p&gt;Thailand’s role as the regional hub for edible insects is reflected in Bangkok’s bustling Khlong Toei market. Among vendor Oonrueng Boonthum’s largest customers are Vietnamese buyers who source water bugs for their restaurants. “They don’t have these bugs in Vietnam,” Boonthum explains, seated at a table piled high with bags of bugs on the busy sidewalk outside the market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Even in Thailand, the biggest challenge for the edible insect industry is people overcoming the “gross” factor of eating whole bugs. In response, producers have turned to grinding insects into flour-like powders that can be mixed into familiar foods and products like cocoa, bread, and noodles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Many people are still scared of the full form of the insect,” says Thanaphum “Eak” Muang-Ieam, who was until recently the president of the Thai Insect Industry Association. “If you put it into powder, that fear goes away.”&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;Though the insect powder market is growing, crickets, in particular, are still widely sold whole—fried and popular as beer snacks. Some restaurants have also found success substituting bugs for meat products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;At Bounce Burger, a restaurant in central Bangkok run from the family home of chef Pooripat “Art” Thiapairat, crickets are fried and peeled; their bodies make up 15 percent of the burger meat patties. “People say they don’t taste the crickets, but they love the burgers,” says Thiapairat.&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;On a recent day, three twentysomething influencers from a Thai social media company visited Bounce Burger to promote it, sampling the burgers and praising their protein-rich, health-boosting qualities. “Young people in Thailand are used to eating insects, but many don’t realize they’re a superfood,” says 26-year-old Natcha Wichean.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Some restaurants embrace insects in their whole form, turning once-reviled creepy crawlers into celebrated stars of high-end dining. At Akkee, a sleek Michelin-starred restaurant tucked away in an industrial area on Bangkok’s outskirts, bugs feature prominently on the menu crafted by Sittikorn “Ou” Chantop, who was named Thailand’s 2024 Michelin Young Chef of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Chantop grew up foraging for and cooking insects with his family at home, a tradition that shaped his culinary roots. He originally envisioned Akkee as a craft beer venue, but the Covid pandemic forced its closure and made him reconsider food and its scarcity. Drawing from his background, Chantop decided to incorporate insects into fine dining. “I was always interested in them because their flavor and aroma are so different from the normal food chain,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.natgeofe.com/n/268d96cb-f45a-4d3c-9655-44346c1752af/MM10337_241204_02022.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A stand at a night market is filled with a variety of trays of edible insects.

The cooking was done entirely over open fires without electronic appliances. Insect dishes, including deep-fried bamboo worms and roasted subterranean ants, were prepared alongside meat and seafood. A fresh box of crickets from the northern city of Chiang Mai was unpacked. Later, insects could be seen crawling behind the kitchen glass. None of the guests seemed fazed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;With bugs transitioning from a rural staple in Thailand to more commercialized products, some worry the country may be losing its traditional heritage. But others argue the shift could benefit local farmers, enabling them to raise insects in their villages and earn a living without relocating to cities. Certain insect species, like weaver ants, remain nearly impossible to farm and must continue to be foraged.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The environmental benefits of edible insect farming have been well-documented. The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has long promoted it as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fao.org/newsroom/story/-Worm-up-to-the-idea-of-edible-insects/en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the future of sustainable food&lt;/a&gt;. Insect farming uses significantly less land, water, and energy than traditional livestock, while emitting fewer greenhouse gases and generating minimal waste. Even cricket droppings, rich in nitrogen, serve as an excellent natural fertilizer for vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/130514-edible-insects-entomophagy-science-food-bugs-beetles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Interested in sampling edible insects? Here are eight popular bugs to try&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Thailand has already started to lead the way globally, with researchers at Khon Kaen University helping the FAO develop &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fao.org/asiapacific/news/news-detail/FAO-releases-a-comprehensive-guide-to-sustainable-cricket-farming-/en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;guidance on cricket farming&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. Strict regulations on farm hygiene, pest control, and food safety have positioned the country as a leading exporter of edible insects in Asia. But, says Muang-Ieam, the former industry association head, “In order to truly change things on a global scale, it’s going to take more than just Thailand.”&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;Beyond Asia, export markets are more limited. Currently, Thailand is unable to export edible insect products to the European market. Skepticism about eating insects remains strong across much of Europe, and insect farming receives far less government support than conventional agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;For now, many companies in Thailand and beyond are focusing on the rapidly expanding pet food market, where black soldier fly larvae are in high demand. These larvae provide a protein-rich alternative to meat and fish traditionally used in pet food. “Pet food is the entryway to the edible insect market,” says Athivach Pongsattasin, founder of Bangkok-based company Exofood. “While human consumption is the future goal, for now, it’s easier to feed insects to pets.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The North American market for edible insects is still in its early stages and currently aimed at pets, but some companies have made significant investments. Aspire Food Group, for example, operates what is said to be the world’s largest cricket processing facility, a 150,000-square-foot plant in London, Ontario. “It’s never been done before at this scale,” says David Rosenberg, Aspire’s CEO.&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;But scaling up has had its challenges. Aspire recently announced it would temporarily scale back production to improve its manufacturing system, leading to severe layoffs. Rosenberg refers to the setbacks as growing pains. “We’re trying to answer questions that haven’t been asked before,” he says, noting the industry’s infancy compared to livestock farming. “For pigs and chickens, there’s 80 years of genetic history. For insects, we’re just starting.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Back in Thailand, Chantajohn recently received Thai Food and Drug Administration clearance to market Ju Lin C, a prebiotic health supplement made with cricket powder. Research suggests that cricket powder &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-29032-2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;can enhance gut microbiota diversity&lt;/a&gt; by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria, improving overall gut health.

And while Portugal&#39;s capital is worth the hype, you&#39;d miss out on Europe&#39;s best-kept secret for family vacations, the Algarve.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Located less than three hours south of Lisbon, the Algarve (from Arabic’s &lt;i&gt;al-garbh&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;for&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&quot;the west”) is the southernmost region of Portugal. Renowned for its golden cliffs, silky sand beaches, picturesque towns, and delectable cuisine, it provides the perfect blend of adventure, relaxation, and discovery for families.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;A relaxing family vacation usually includes visiting a beach destination. The Litoral, or the coastline of the Algarve region, is bursting with stunning beaches. If you prefer to have a quieter beach experience, you should visit beaches like Praia do Carvalho, which is largely hidden and accessed through a tunnel. A note to parents: There are no bathrooms available here; however, the waves are very calm, and it is tucked away, making for an easy beach-going experience.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.natgeofe.com/n/213d62ef-6181-4868-9f11-b925ec757572/h_29_130925mb82_91765.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The sand meets the blue ocean with a cluster of boats sitting in front of large rocks in the water.&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;From hidden coves to sprawling stretches of sand with restaurants, the Algarve is home to a wide variety of beaches.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.natgeofe.com/n/df18773a-b58e-4ee0-9f67-8e431be3311d/h_29_130925mb77_91760.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rocky cliffs sit to the right of a blue ocean with a light house at the edge of the rocks.&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Algarve&#39;s coast is dotted with cliffs, lighthouses, forts, and other attractions worth exploring.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;      &lt;p&gt;If your family likes more activity, Praia da Rocha has several restaurants, public restrooms, and other facilities close by so you can easily spend all day by the water. And, the waves and current are extremely calm along Praia da Rocha, making it the perfect place to spend the day playing on the beach with your kids.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;One of the hardest things to face as a parent is a picky eater. However, traditional Portuguese food has numerous dishes that will appeal to even the most challenging eaters.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;For those in the family who prefer more simple dishes, grilled pork with rice or fries is a very common menu option found in the Algarve region. Another common dish is &lt;i&gt;piri-piri,&lt;/i&gt; or flame-grilled chicken, with mild or spicy sauces on the side. If your family likes to try new dishes, then you should order &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.portugal.com/food-drink/10-best-portuguese-foods-and-dishes/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bacalhau&lt;/a&gt;, or cod, which is the national dish of Portugal. Travelers can find cod prepared fried with french fries or boiled with vegetables on many menus around the Algarve region.&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;For a guaranteed kid-friendly meal, look for restaurants labeled as &lt;i&gt;“churrasqueiras”&lt;/i&gt; (Portuguese barbecue houses) or casual cafes that serve sandwiches, burgers, and fresh pastries.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Many restaurants also serve omelets, pastas, and soups, making it easy to find something more familiar for your kids to eat. Hotels often offer more international buffets with a mix of local and Western-styled dishes, which are great options for families who want to try new dishes but have picky eaters in tow.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;And of course, you can&#39;t forget about dessert! The famous pastel de nata, Portugal&#39;s national dessert, is an egg custard served with cinnamon sprinkled on top and usually served warm.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/where-to-eat-lisbons-best-pastel-de-nata&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Related: Where to eat Lisbon’s best pastel de nata&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;When planning meals, it is important to keep in mind that many restaurants don’t open for dinner until 7 or 8 p.m., though it is more common to find restaurants that open earlier in some tourist-friendly spots. Consider having a late afternoon snack or checking with your hotel for early dining options.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;The Algarve has numerous family-friendly activities that go beyond its famous coastline. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visitportugal.com/en/content/parque-natural-da-ria-formosa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ria Formosa Natural Park&lt;/a&gt;, a sprawling system of lagoons and wetlands, is perfect for family adventures like birdwatching, boat tours, and easy nature walks. The park is home to flamingos, chameleons, and countless other species, making it a fascinating destination for kids of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;A visit to &lt;a href=&quot;https://sandcity.pt/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sand City&lt;/a&gt; is a must. Located near Lagoa, this incredible park showcases towering sand sculptures crafted by talented artists from around the globe. Families can stroll through the exhibits, take photos of their favorite creations, and participate in sand-sculpting workshops to try this intricate art form.&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;A speedboat tour is a thrilling way to explore the Algarve&#39;s dramatic cliffs and hidden grottos, with the iconic Benagil Cave being the highlight. While the speedboat ride is exhilarating for kids, it&#39;s also a great opportunity for parents to soak in the region&#39;s natural beauty and snap some unforgettable photos.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;For the adults in need of a bit of a breather, the Algarve is home to an impressive selection of wineries and vineyards where you can unwind. Places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://quintadosvales.pt/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Quinta dos Vales&lt;/a&gt; offer wine tastings in a serene setting, with stunning views of rolling vineyards and artistic sculptures scattered across the grounds. Many wineries even provide family-friendly amenities, like open gardens and picnic areas, allowing kids to play while parents indulge in a glass of locally produced wine.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/best-wildlife-watching-portugual&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Related: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;5 of Portugal&#39;s best wildlife-watching destinations, from the Algarve to Lisbon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;For a day of fun learning, explore the Algarve&#39;s rich history in towns like Lagos and Silves. Silves, with its striking Moorish castle and ancient city walls, offers travelers of all ages a chance to imagine life in medieval times.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Lagos, on the other hand, combines a vibrant atmosphere with historical landmarks such as the old city gates and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://museu.cm-lagos.pt/polos/forte-ponta-da-bandeira/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Forte Ponta da Bandeira&lt;/a&gt; and the old Lighthouse of Ponta de Sagres.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;For a creative twist, families can join workshops in Silves to learn traditional Portuguese crafts like pottery or tile painting. Both crafts have long histories, reaching back as far as the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, and are deeply engrained in Portugal’s national identity.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;The Algarve is best seen if you rent a car. Though there are bus options between the major cities, having your own means of transportation will make a family vacation easier.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Once you’re within a city, though, it’s best to leave the car in one spot. Finding parking can be difficult, so it’s best to find a spot and then explore on foot from there. Strollers can also be tricky on the cobblestone streets — and cobblestone sidewalks — so pack a baby carrier if you’re traveling with little ones.&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinhal.com/locations/sagres/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Martinhal Sagres Beach Family Resort&lt;/a&gt; stands out as a haven for families, with spacious accommodations, multiple kids&#39; clubs, and a wide range of activities that cater to all age groups. Similarly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pinecliffs.com/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pine Cliffs Resort&lt;/a&gt; in Olhos de Água, combines breathtaking cliffside views with incredible amenities like a children&#39;s village, mini-golf, and direct access to Falésia Beach. Families looking for a blend of luxury and fun will love &lt;a href=&quot;https://vilavitaparc.com/en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vila Vita Parc&lt;/a&gt; in Porches. The resort has lush gardens, a dedicated kids&#39; club, and direct beach access.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The luxurious &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/faoapci-conrad-algarve/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Conrad Algarve&lt;/a&gt; in Quinta do Lago provides spacious rooms, a heated infinity pool, and family-centric activities like a kid&#39;s club.

We think walking sandals offer the perfect mix of comfort and versatility for all your travels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Walking sandals are great because you can wear them around the city, out on a hike, or even to the beach,” says Peyton Bergmann, a teacher and avid outdoorsman based in Ypsilanti, Michigan. “You may want to consider certain factors based on your primary use, but the great thing about them is they’re flexible and versatile by nature.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Matthew Neylon, a runner, cyclist, and camper based in Los Angeles, California, relies on them for a variety of adventures. “I take them on hikes with me because they can have really great grip traction on the bottom,” he says. “I also wear mine casually when it’s nice out, whether I’m running errands or going on a chill bike ride.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In this guide, we’ve handpicked the best men’s walking sandals for travel.

target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Skechers Go Walk Massage Fit Sandal&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;p&gt;When selecting walking sandals for men, look for comfort, robust support, and versatile performance. High-quality materials and construction will last on both urban environments and rugged trails, while features like cushioned insoles, enhanced arch support, and reliable traction keep feet comfortable during long journeys. Additionally, water resistance, breathability, and modern design are just as important. Ultimately, the best walking sandals should provide great value for the price.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why we like it: &lt;/b&gt;The Cairn Evo is a true all-rounder. Exceptional traction via the Vibram XS Trek Evo rubber compound and sturdy build make it a reliable companion on any terrain. The thoughtfully engineered design (minimalist footbed, abrasion-free stitching, Y-strap adjustability) help these sandals easily transition from rugged trails to urban sidewalks. We appreciate the robust construction, which combines practicality with a classic, versatile style that’s packable and works with lots of travel wardrobes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep in mind: &lt;/b&gt;Due to its robust construction, these sandals may feel a bit heavier than typical beachwear options. They may also require a short break-in period.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product details: Material:&lt;/b&gt; Handcrafted leather upper with recycled textile elements, according to the brand; Vibram XS Trek EVO rubber outsole | &lt;b&gt;Sizes:&lt;/b&gt; 7-13 | &lt;b&gt;Colors:&lt;/b&gt; 11&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why we like it: &lt;/b&gt;The Current by Kuru has a cushioned EVA midsole, a heel-hugging design, and grippy multidirectional treads ideal for long days of navigating historic streets and modern cityscapes alike. The breathable synthetic mesh upper helps keep feet cool and supported, even during extended wear. We also like that the neutral colorways go with everything—perfect for light packers—and that they’re waterproof.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep in mind: &lt;/b&gt;Some reviewers say this walking sandal runs small, so you may want to go up half a size.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product details: Material:&lt;/b&gt; Synthetic mesh, cushioned EVA midsole | &lt;b&gt;Sizes:&lt;/b&gt; 7-12 | &lt;b&gt;Colors:&lt;/b&gt; 5&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/best-walking-shoes-for-travel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;These are the best walking shoes for every kind of traveler&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why we like it: &lt;/b&gt;The Cruiser is made with a molded memory foam cushion for better arch support and a rocker design to help reduce foot fatigue. We also like the padded straps for cushy and supported stride all day. Customers confirm that these sandals feel comfortable and fit well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep in mind: &lt;/b&gt;If you have a neutral arch, you might find the extra support less necessary. Additionally, the design leans toward function rather than fashion. We’d wear these to the beach or a casual weekend away.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product details: Material:&lt;/b&gt; Synthetic upper, nitrogen-infused memory foam EVA footbed, rubber outsole | &lt;b&gt;Sizes:&lt;/b&gt; 6-13 | &lt;b&gt;Colors:&lt;/b&gt; 11&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why we like it: &lt;/b&gt;The Ecco Cozmo strikes a good balance between style and function. The boho look complements any travel outfit, while premium materials and craftsmanship (premium full-grain or nubuck leather) help ensure durability. These sandals are also comfortable, with Velcro straps and an anatomically contoured footbed for top-notch support through hours of walking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep in mind: &lt;/b&gt;This upscale sandal comes with a higher price tag. The fashion-forward look may not suit every travel scenario.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product details: Material:&lt;/b&gt; Leather or suede, polyurethane (PU) | &lt;b&gt;Sizes:&lt;/b&gt; 7-13 | &lt;b&gt;Colors:&lt;/b&gt; 6&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/best-white-sneakers-for-travel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here’s why white sneakers are actually pretty great travel shoes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why we like it: &lt;/b&gt;The Gemini is engineered with specialized orthopedic features that make it a standout option for travelers battling plantar fasciitis. It’s made with multiple layers of support, which includes a specialized insole, a layer of cushion, and extra heel support to help alleviate foot pain. We love all the adjustable straps (even one on the heel) and the multidirectional rubber outsole for good traction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep in mind: &lt;/b&gt;The specialized design means these sandals are workhorses that may not pair well with everything in your suitcase, so plan accordingly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product details: Material:&lt;/b&gt; Breathable synthetic upper, orthopedic foam, rubber outsole | &lt;b&gt;Sizes:&lt;/b&gt; 8-14 | &lt;b&gt;Colors:&lt;/b&gt; 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why we like it: &lt;/b&gt;Chaco says the Z/1 Rapid Pro was designed with rafting experts and tested in the field. It features a Vibram rubber outsole that Chaco says grabs onto wet surfaces six times better than other water sandals. We like the adjustable straps for getting a snug fit, especially when it’s wet out, plus the rugged yet colorful style that looks good on dry land too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.skimresources.com/?id=251963X1735872&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.teva.com/men-sandals/forebay-water-sandal/1001116.html&amp;amp;xcust=web-lifestyle-mens-walkingsandal-2025mar-20&amp;amp;sref=nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/Best-walking-sandals-for-men&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Teva Forebay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; came in a close second for waterproof walking sandals. This strong contender offers similarly impressive waterproof capabilities in a more streamlined design. It’s an excellent alternative if you’re after a slightly lighter, minimalist feel without sacrificing performance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep in mind: &lt;/b&gt;Chaco’s Z/1 Rapid Pro sandals can feel a bit bulky. The adjustable straps take a little getting used to (there’s even an online tutorial on the brand website). They also benefit from regular cleaning to maintain peak performance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product details: Material:&lt;/b&gt; Polyester webbing, nylon straps, Vibram rubber outsole | &lt;b&gt;Sizes:&lt;/b&gt; 7-13 | &lt;b&gt;Colors:&lt;/b&gt; 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/best-hiking-boots-for-men&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dedicated hikers say these are the best men’s hiking boots&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why we like it: &lt;/b&gt;Keen’s Newport H2 is designed for convenience. The bungee-based lacing system makes it easy to step in, then quickly cinch to tighten. Technically water shoes, these sandals have lightweight cushioning in the midsole for comfort, plus good arch support. The brand tops this off with solid traction via multidirectional lugs, helping to ensure feet stay secure, whether you’re in or out of the water. The quick-drying synthetic mesh upper combined with TPU overlays means you don’t need to worry about getting wet.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep in mind: &lt;/b&gt;The slip-on style may not feel as secure for narrower feet or during high-impact activities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product details: Material:&lt;/b&gt; Synthetic mesh upper with TPU overlays, rubber outsole | &lt;b&gt;Sizes:&lt;/b&gt; 6-13 | &lt;b&gt;Colors:&lt;/b&gt; 20&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why we like it: &lt;/b&gt;Olukai’s flip flop style sandals excel at keeping feet cool and comfortable, thanks to the waterproof full-grain leather construction paired with a soft, breathable liner. The wide foot straps and nylon toe post feel comfortable, while the multiple tread patches help enable a secure step. These sandals are timeless and versatile, making them great for long walks in warm climates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.skimresources.com/?id=251963X1735872&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.merrell.com/US/en/hydro-mule/56591M.html&amp;amp;xcust=web-lifestyle-mens-walkingsandal-2025mar-20&amp;amp;sref=nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/Best-walking-sandals-for-men&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Merrell Hydro Mule&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is another great choice for breathable sandals. It’s got mesh all over it and a unique, modern design. It’s also made with recycled materials, according to the company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep in mind: &lt;/b&gt;Even though the leather on the Olukai Tuahine is waterproof, it still requires a bit of extra care (we suggest a leather conditioner).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product details: Material:&lt;/b&gt; Leather, mesh liner, nylon toe post, rubber outsole | &lt;b&gt;Sizes:&lt;/b&gt; 7-12 | &lt;b&gt;Colors:&lt;/b&gt; 6&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/best-walking-shoes-for-men&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here are our top picks for men’s walking shoes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why we like it: &lt;/b&gt;At under $100, the Skechers Go Walk Massage Fit Sandal offers impressive comfort and functionality. The lightweight construction and responsive memory foam footbed work together to provide a pleasant walking experience on a variety of surfaces. Adjustable straps, woven ripstop upper, and dual-density traction—there isn’t much more a budget-conscious traveler could ask for.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep in mind: &lt;/b&gt;While these sandals deliver great value, they may not offer the advanced support or longevity of some higher-end models. These sandals are ideal for travelers who want comfort and affordability without extra frills.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product details: Material:&lt;/b&gt; Synthetic upper, memory foam footbed, rubber outsole | &lt;b&gt;Sizes:&lt;/b&gt; 6-14 | &lt;b&gt;Colors:&lt;/b&gt; 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/best-hoka-hiking-shoes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here are 10 of the best Hoka hiking shoes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;In addition to speaking with longtime outdoors enthusiasts and our own experience in menswear, we based our selections on extensive research to ensure every pair meets the diverse needs of today’s traveler. Below are the key factors we considered when evaluating each product:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;•&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Third-party reviews:&lt;/b&gt; We incorporated insights from trusted experts and customer reviews to understand how the sandals perform in everyday conditions. These reviews provide essential real-world perspectives on durability, comfort, and overall satisfaction that go beyond product specifications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;•&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brand reputation:&lt;/b&gt; We considered the longstanding history and trust associated with each brand, as a strong reputation often reflects consistent quality, reliable customer service, and innovative design.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;•&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Materials:&lt;/b&gt; We examined the materials, construction techniques, and overall resilience to ensure the sandals can handle both urban adventures and rugged terrain. We evaluated how well the sandals manage moisture and keep feet cool in unpredictable weather conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;•&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Price and value for money: &lt;/b&gt;We weighed cost against features and quality, ensuring there’s a great pick for every budget.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;•&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comfort and support: &lt;/b&gt;We prioritized cushioned insoles, enhanced arch support, and ergonomic designs to minimize foot fatigue during long journeys.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;•&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Versatility and performance: &lt;/b&gt;We assessed how each pair performs across diverse environments—from city streets to off-road trails—to guarantee a seamless travel experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fit and comfort&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When selecting walking sandals, prioritize a snug yet flexible fit that offers ample cushioning and proper arch support. A well-designed sandal should conform to the natural shape of your foot, reducing fatigue during long days of exploration and ensuring lasting comfort on varied terrain.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Durability and build quality&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Focus on sandals constructed from high-quality materials with reinforced stitching, robust soles, and well-crafted uppers that can withstand unpredictable weather and rugged surfaces. This will help ensure your investment will last through many adventures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Versatility and performance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Choose a pair that adapts seamlessly from urban streets to off-road trails. Look for features such as multidirectional lugs or Vibram traction, water resistance, and breathable materials that help manage moisture, so you’re prepared for any environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Style and aesthetic appeal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;While functionality is paramount, design is also important, especially when suitcase space is limited. A visually appealing pair means you can wear them on and off the trail, potentially reducing the number of shoes you need to pack.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Price and value&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;While there are plenty of high-end walking sandals out there, travelers can certainly find great options at a good price. Weigh the cost against materials, warranty policies, and overall performance. If possible, it always helps to try walking sandals on in person to get a good feel for quality and even performance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Additional considerations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don’t overlook factors such as brand reputation and ease of maintenance. A well-established brand often signifies consistent quality, reliable customer service, and innovative design, while sandals that are easy to clean and maintain can offer extra peace of mind over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which brand of sandals is most comfortable for walking?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many travelers find that brands like Ecco, Keen, and Reef offer exceptional comfort due to their supportive footbeds and high-quality materials. Ultimately, the best brand depends on your foot shape and walking style. We especially like the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/ECCO-Sandal-Marine-Nubuck-11-11-5/dp/B0BR5PL2KH?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=web-lifestyle-mens-walkingsandal-2025mar-20&amp;amp;linkId=9ad92ac41559d405935bac0296316747&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Ecco Cozmo Men’s Nubuck Two-Strap Sandal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the&lt;a href=&quot;https://go.skimresources.com/?id=251963X1735872&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.rei.com/product/707782/keen-newport-h2-sandals-mens&amp;amp;xcust=web-lifestyle-mens-walkingsandal-2025mar-20&amp;amp;sref=nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/Best-walking-sandals-for-men&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Keen Men’s Newport H2 Sandal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/REEF-Swellsole-Recovery-Enhanced-Friendly/dp/B0B5W9NP61?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=web-lifestyle-mens-walkingsandal-2025mar-20&amp;amp;linkId=e1f1cd48c89aa0d09e398e5baeb04741&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Reef’s Cruiser&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What sandals do podiatrists recommend?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Podiatrists often recommend sandals that provide excellent arch support and cushioning, such as those from Ecco or Orthofeet, for maintaining foot health. You can try our top picks,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/ECCO-Sandal-Marine-Nubuck-11-11-5/dp/B0BR5PL2KH?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=web-lifestyle-mens-walkingsandal-2025mar-20&amp;amp;linkId=9ad92ac41559d405935bac0296316747&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Ecco’s Cozmo Men’s Nubuck Two-Strap Sandal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Orthofeet-Mens-Orthopedic-Strap-Sandals/dp/B0C72TPF2N?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=web-lifestyle-mens-walkingsandal-2025mar-20&amp;amp;linkId=2b6f44553b2f1c53d454024ceae3e401&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;OrthoFeet’s Gemini&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s best to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice based on your needs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is a sandal good for walking?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, a well-designed walking sandal can be a great option for both casual strolls and longer adventures. Look for features like proper cushioning, secure straps, and reliable arch support to ensure comfort throughout your journey.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.griffzales.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Griffin Gonzales&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a freelance writer based in Detroit, Michigan, specializing in menswear and American-made products.
