I loved the energy of broken beats and enjoyed playing those tunes at parties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These days, I enjoy whatever music makes me want to move to it, whatever style it might be. I love getting feedback, so please comment on the mixes and let me know what you think. Also all kinds of music suggestions are appreciated. - Powered by RSSHub</description><generator>RSSHub</generator><webMaster>contact@rsshub.app (RSSHub)</webMaster><itunes:author>dholbach</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>false</itunes:explicit><language>en</language><image><url>https://thumbnailer.mixcloud.com/unsafe/480x480/profile/7/6/2/0/e1f3-227f-4027-b764-99fe8aa85db6</url><title>Mixcloud - dholbach&#39;s Shows</title><link>https://www.mixcloud.com/dholbach/uploads/</link></image><lastBuildDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 21:25:35 GMT</lastBuildDate><ttl>5</ttl><item><title>99 Jahre Cargo-Cult</title><description>Wow, what a blast - I can&#39;t believe Cargo Cult has been going this long already.

I hadn&#39;t played a Drum&#39;n&#39;Bass set in ages, but since I had lovers of broken beats in front of me, there was no holding back. I had the pleasure of being supported by MC Massiv La Gaza, which unfortunately wasn&#39;t captured on this recording.</description><link>https://www.mixcloud.com/dholbach/cargo-cult-crew-berlin-six-beat-under</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Cloudcast:2167636044</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Dec 2022 11:48:20 GMT</pubDate><author>dholbach</author><itunes:image href="https://thumbnailer.mixcloud.com/unsafe/480x480/extaudio/e/d/a/4/b61c-9e19-4efb-ac91-bff6345efe76"></itunes:image><enclosure url="https://stream.mixcloud.stream/secure/c/m4a/64/9/1/3/0/7ddf-6fa2-483b-a729-b1a11597aefa.m4a?sig=L83J4-VhKiV2R2Xvq9NeMA" type="audio/x-m4a"></enclosure><itunes:duration>1:02:45</itunes:duration></item><item><title>Fam&#39;s Birthday @ Strandbad Pl√∂tzensee</title><description>While it was raining and hailing in Neuk√∂lln, we enjoyed a late summer day and night in Strandbad Pl√∂tzensee and celebrated Fam&#39;s birthday.
