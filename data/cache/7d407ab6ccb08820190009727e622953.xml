I&#39;ve turned the flags off now, but it&#39;s easy enough to understand why HN readers would be flagging an article like this: there have been a bunch of other major recent threads on the same topic cluster. Avoiding repetition, and especially the deadly duo of repetition/indignation, is a core principle to keeping the site interesting.
