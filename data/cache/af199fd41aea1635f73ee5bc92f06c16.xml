About half of these deaths occur in infants younger than 6 months of age. The majority of paediatric RSV deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries where there is limited access to supportive medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no specific treatments for RSV infection, making supportive measures the main line of therapy. Preventive measures, such as vaccines, are key to reducing cases of pneumonia and bronchiolitis, decreasing hospitalizations and oxygen use, and saving infant lives globally. After decades of research, there are currently two licensed immunization products for prevention of RSV disease in young infants: the maternal vaccine given to pregnant women in the third trimester to protect their babies and a long-acting monoclonal antibody administered to infants from birth just before or during the RSV season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\&quot;RSV has long been an under-recognized public health problem, significantly impacting infants worldwide,” says Dr Katherine O’Brien, WHO Director, Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. “Expanding access to maternal RSV vaccination will help keep infants out of hospitals, save lives and free up limited resources for other health priorities.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2024, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) made global recommendations&amp;nbsp;to introduce passive immunization (maternal vaccination and infant monoclonal antibodies) for the prevention of severe RSV disease in young infants. The subsequent prequalification of the maternal RSV vaccine in March 2025 reflects the Organization’s commitment to improving health equity by expediting access to life-saving health products in parallel to developing recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prequalified maternal vaccine, ABRYSVO®, aims to prevent RSV-associated disease in infants during the first 6 months through the transfer of antibodies during gestation. ABRYSVO® is manufactured by Pfizer with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as the Regulatory Authority of reference. To date, the maternal RSV vaccine has only been used in high- and middle-income countries. With prequalification and new WHO recommendations, the aim is to expand RSV vaccination to low- and lower-middle-income countries where the risk of severe disease and death is highest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO will launch a position paper on RSV vaccines in May 2025 based on the SAGE recommendations. The aim of the position paper is to inform national public health officials and immunization programme managers on use of RSV immunization products in their national programmes, as well as national and international funding agencies.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prequalification is a pre-requisite for financial support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and for vaccine purchases by UN agencies such as UNICEF. The Gavi Board will make further decisions about the inclusion the maternal RSV vaccine within the Organization’s vaccine portfolio during 2025.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;color:inherit;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;----&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://confirmsubscription.com/h/d/4BC833B1BCA2AAC0/%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe to the Global Immunization Newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//19-03-2025-who-prequalifies-first-maternal-respiratory-syncytial-virus-vaccine</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//19-03-2025-who-prequalifies-first-maternal-respiratory-syncytial-virus-vaccine</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:23:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>New Health Investment Platform to improve primary health care convenes its first Steering Committee</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/about/collaboration/health-impact-investment-platform/%22&quot;&gt;Health Impact Investment Platform (HIIP)&lt;/a&gt; held its inaugural Steering Committee meeting, marking a significant milestone in advancing innovative financing for global health. As the Platform’s highest decision-making body, the Committee – consisting of representatives from the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Investment Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank – reviewed progress, endorsed key governance and operational priorities, and provided strategic guidance on HIIP’s efforts to expand primary health care (PHC) services in low- and middle-income countries. The meeting represents a significant step forward in advancing sustainable financing solutions for global health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HIIP was unveiled during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.climate-chance.org/en/event-calendar/summit-financial-pact-international-aid-fund/#:~:text=From%20June%2022%20to%2023,during%20the%20COP27%20in%20Egypt.\%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Summit for a New Global Financing Pact&lt;/a&gt; in Paris in 2023, and is a landmark partnership between WHO, multilateral development banks and beneficiary countries. Amid a US$&amp;nbsp;371&amp;nbsp;billion annual health financing gap for health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and a US$&amp;nbsp;31.1&amp;nbsp;billion annual funding requirement for pandemic preparedness, the Platform innovates multilateral solutions to increase the share of development funding going to the health sector. Integrating technical expertise, financial resources and local knowledge into impactful, country-driven investments in vulnerable communities, the Platform has mobilized over US$&amp;nbsp;30&amp;nbsp;million of investment for WHO to support countries in developing prioritized investment plans for potential support from MDBs and donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Platform aims to use these plans to generate over US$1.5 billion funding for low- and middle-income country governments to build resilience against pandemic threats and the climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Primary health care is the cornerstone of equitable, cost-effective, and inclusive health systems,” said Catharina Boehme, Assistant Director-General at the World Health Organization. “The Health Impact Investment Platform is a transformative initiative to mobilize financing for climate-adaptive and crisis-resilient primary health care in the countries that need it most. WHO is proud to partner with multilateral development banks and countries to ensure these funds deliver tangible impact for the communities we serve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The First Steering Committee builds on months of progress since the Platform’s official launch in September 2024, with early-stage engagements in more than 10 countries. During the meeting, Committee members approved key operational documents for the platform, reviewed Concept Notes developed to operationalize primary health care investments in Burundi, The Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Kazakhstan, Maldives, Morocco and Zambia and formally approved the Proposal for Action in Ethiopia, unlocking funding to support the finalization of its national PHC investment plan. Members reinforced the platform’s core focus on scaling primary health care investments, accelerating progress toward universal health coverage, and strengthening health system resilience in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issa Faye, Director General of Global Practice and Partnerships&amp;nbsp;at the Islamic Development Bank noted, “We are committed to catalyzing impactful, sustainable investments that strengthen health systems in low- and middle-income countries. Today’s discussions reaffirmed our shared vision and commitment to scaling up investment in primary health care, ensuring that no country is left behind in achieving universal health coverage and pandemic preparedness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next Steering Committee meeting will convene on the margins of the Seventy-Eighth World Health Assembly (19–27 May 2025), where progress on Ethiopia’s investment plan and new country engagements will be reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Östros, Vice President at the European Investment Bank and the newly appointed Chair of the Steering Committee emphasized, “The Health Impact Investment Platform is a unique opportunity to bridge the health financing gap and drive sustainable investments where they are most needed. As we look ahead to the next Steering Committee, our focus remains on turning commitments into action. We call on all stakeholders to join us in expanding access to quality primary health care, ensuring that investments today translate into stronger, more resilient health systems for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the HIIP will deepen engagements with the first wave of applicants and expand support to other interested countries. Eligible countries for the HIIP include low- and middle-income countries which are a country of operation for at least one of the partner Multilateral Development Banks.

Any disruptions to TB services will have fatal consequences for the millions of people affected by TB worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent service disruptions and ensure continuity of quality TB care worldwide, urgent measures are needed. The latest joint statement by the WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and the &lt;a target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/groups/civil-society-task-force-on-tb/%22&quot;&gt;WHO Civil Society Task Force on Tuberculosis (CSTF-TB)&lt;/a&gt; sets out key actions required to sustain momentum, mobilize resources and strengthen TB responses worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of WHO’s Global Programme on Tuberculosis and Lung Health, emphasized, “The world cannot afford to step back in the fight against TB.

Fourteen (14) of the 16 Committee Members, and one of the two Advisors to the Committee participated in the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), the Deputy Director-General  welcomed Members of and Advisors to the Committee, as well as Government Officials designated to present their views to the Committee on behalf of the ten invited States Parties – Burundi, Canada, China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Nepal, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Uganda, United Arab Emirates and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (United Kingdom).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his opening remarks, the WHO Deputy Director-General recalled that, on 14 August 2024, the upsurge of mpox was determined to constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). He noted that, over the three years from 1 January 2022 through 31 January 2025, almost 130&amp;nbsp;000 confirmed cases of mpox, including over 280 deaths, were reported to WHO from 130 countries and territories in all six WHO Regions, including seven countries and territories that had reported their first mpox cases since the previous meeting of the Committee on 22 November 2024. The WHO African Region, where some States Parties are continuing to experience sustained community transmission, accounts for 61% of the cases and 72% of the deaths reported globally over the past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO Deputy Director-General highlighted that, since the last meeting of the Committee, the epidemiological situation continues to be volatile. Despite observed improvements pertaining to several aspects of the response – emergency coordination, surveillance, laboratory diagnostics, empowerment of communities, furthering equitable access to medical countermeasures and tools – several critical challenges had emerged, including: (a) rising geopolitical instability in the DRC due to escalating conflict affecting mpox response operations resulting in temporary pauses in operation, relocation of staff and restricted access to affected populations; (b) concurrent health emergencies  requiring States Parties and partners to respond (e.g. Sudan virus disease outbreak in Uganda); and (c) uncertainties related to the pause in financial support from the United States of America (United States) occurring in the broader landscape of declining foreign assistance. To date, globally, one-third of the funds supporting the response to mpox had been pledged by the United States. Without sufficient funds, the ability of States Parties, WHO and partners to maintain, sustain, and expand the response to mpox would be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Representative of the Office of Legal Counsel then briefed the Members and Advisors on their roles and responsibilities and identified the mandate of the Committee under the relevant articles of the IHR. The Ethics Officer from the Department of Compliance, Risk Management, and Ethics provided the Members and Advisors with an overview of the WHO Declaration of Interests process. The Members and Advisors were made aware of their individual responsibility to disclose to WHO, in a timely manner, any interests of a personal, professional, financial, intellectual or commercial nature that may give rise to a perceived or actual conflict of interest. They were additionally reminded of their duty to maintain the confidentiality of the meeting discussions and the work of the Committee. Each Member and Advisor was surveyed, with no conflicts of interest identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meeting was handed over to the Chair who introduced the objectives of the meeting, which were to provide views to the WHO Director-General on whether the event continues to constitute a PHEIC, and if so, to provide views on the potential proposed temporary recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Session open to representatives of States Parties invited to present their views&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO Secretariat presented an overview of the global epidemiological situation of mpox, including all circulating clades of monkeypox virus (MPXV). Outside the WHO African Region, cases of mpox reported to WHO are associated with the spread of MPXV clade IIb, with a decline in the number of cases reported in recent months. In the WHO African Region, amid the circulation of multiple MPXV clades, the still growing number of cases reported monthly is driven by the spread of MPXV clade Ib. Since the Committee last met, on 22 November 2024, exported travel-related cases of confirmed MPXV clade Ib infection have been detected in eight additional countries outside the WHO African Region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO Secretariat then focused on the three countries reporting most cases of MPXV clade Ib since January 2024 – the DRC (over 15&amp;nbsp;000 cases, including cases in areas where MPXV clade Ia is circulating); Burundi (over 3000 cases, with a sustained decrease reported weekly and a geographic shift to the administrative capital Gitega since the Committee last met); and Uganda (nearly 3000 cases, with an exponential increase in and around the capital Kampala since the Committee last met). Notwithstanding changes in the case definition of mpox cases, uneven surveillance coverage (including due to the conflict in the eastern provinces of the country), and limited laboratory testing capacity in the DRC introducing some challenges in the interpretation of data , the number of mpox cases reported weekly is plateauing and the geographic distribution of cases, in all provinces in the country, remained very similar to the situation presented at the previous meeting of the Committee. Mathematical modelling work suggests that, since the PHEIC was determined in mid-August 2024 in the DRC, the transmission rate has decreased in certain health zones of the North Kivu and South Kivu Provinces, as well as in some health zones of the capital Kinshasa where vaccination efforts are underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spread of MPXV clade Ia and Ib, in North Kivu, South Kivu, and Kinshasa Provinces of the DRC, as well as in Burundi and Uganda, appears to have started among adults, including through sexual networks involving commercial sex workers and their clients, disproportionately affecting the 20–39 years age group. Since then, in North Kivu and South Kivu Provinces of the DRC, more age group became affected reflecting community transmission through close contact, including household, whereas, in the capital Kinshasa, the spread has remained within the adult population. In Burundi and Uganda, the age distribution of mpox cases shows a bimodal pattern, with high incidence observed among young adults and younger children. This pattern reflects both ongoing sexual transmission and close contact transmission in household settings. The strikingly high proportion of cases among younger children (0-9 age group) observed in Burundi is possibly attributable to transmission occurring within health care facilities settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the three aforementioned countries, community transmission of MPXV clade Ib is also observed in Kenya, Rwanda, and Zambia, while travel-related imported cases have been reported both, by countries in the WHO African Region (Angola, Zimbabwe, with cases in Tanzania being under investigation), and by 14 countries in the five remaining WHO Regions. Most travel-related imported cases are male and, in instances where limited secondary transmission in the country of importation has occurred, a few children have been infected through household contact, including child-to-child transmission on one occasion. The five imported cases with sole travel history to the United Arab Emirates may signal wider mpox transmission in that country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mortality associated with the different MPXV clades in the WHO African Region, and notwithstanding the limitation of surveillance and laboratory diagnostics in the DRC, clade Ia accounts for the majority of fatal cases (1345), corresponding to an average case fatality rate (CFR%) of 2.5-3%, being highest in children under 1 year of age (4–5%). The CFR attributed with clade Ib infection remains very low at around 0.2%, and similar to the that attributed to clade IIb, with recorded deaths associated with specific risk factors such as uncontrolled HIV and other comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO Secretariat also noted an increase in mpox cases reported in West African countries since the PHEIC was determined in mid-August 2024, including the first cases of mpox, due to MPXV clade IIa, reported by Sierra Leone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO Secretariat presented the assessed risk by MPXV clades and further expressed in terms of overall public health risk where any given clade/s is/are circulating, as: Clade Ib – high public health risk in the DRC and neighbouring countries; Clade Ia – moderate public health risk in the DRC; Clade II – moderate public health risk in Nigeria and countries of West and Central Africa where mpox is endemic; and lade IIb – moderate public health risk globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO Secretariat subsequently provided an update on response actions taken together with States Parties and partners since the Committee last met. In addition to the overview provided by the WHO Deputy Director-General, and in the epidemiological overview, the WHO Secretariat provided details on progress and challenges focusing on the aspects of the response outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coordination of emergency operations by the WHO Secretariat was readjusted – including based on action reviews and leveraging the comparative advantages of WHO, State Parties, and partners –prioritizing a flexible, agile, and delivery-focused response. However, while decentralized field operations have intensified, such shifts take time, particularly in specific settings in the DRC and amid changes in geopolitical partnerships. The operational decentralization continues to emphasize increased laboratory diagnostic support, increased dissemination of standards and guidance to deliver safe clinical care, and empowering communities to enhance their efforts to protect themselves from risks associated with mpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, through the Access and Allocation Mechanism (AAM), WHO and partners (Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance (Gavi), and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)) are continuing coordinated and multifaceted efforts to prioritize access to and roll out mpox vaccines in an equitable manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/m/item/mpox-global-strategic-preparedness-and-response-plan/%22&quot;&gt;WHO Mpox global strategic preparedness and response plan, September 2024-February 2025&lt;/a&gt; (SPRP) reaching the end of its initial timeframe, and considering the response strategy it outlines as still fit for purpose, the WHO Secretariat is planning to release an extension of the plan in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2024, the WHO Secretariat launched an appeal for US$&amp;nbsp;87.4&amp;nbsp;million to support mpox response efforts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/m/item/who-appeal--mpox-public-health-emergency-2024/%22&quot;&gt;WHO appeal: mpox public health emergency 2024&lt;/a&gt; with US$&amp;nbsp;65.5&amp;nbsp;million raised by the time of this meeting. The contribution from the United States had accounted for 33% of the funds raised, of which US$&amp;nbsp;7.5&amp;nbsp;million is currently inaccessible due to the freeze of funds from the United States. As part of planning for the extension of the SPRP, the WHO Secretariat is conducting a review of available resources to address priority needs and mitigate potential future gaps in the delivery of the response. While the above-mentioned freeze is expected to primarily impact operations in Burundi, the Central African Republic, the DRC, the Republic of the Congo, and Rwanda, broader challenges are anticipated for the second and third quarters of 2025. Given the evolving epidemiological situation and challenges noted above, the reduction in predictable and flexible funding throughout 2025 will put at risk the progress of the mpox response to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives of Burundi, the DRC, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Uganda updated the Committee on the mpox epidemiological situation in their countries and their current control and response efforts, needs and challenges, including those related to the freeze of the funds from the United States. The use of mpox vaccine is contemplated in the response plans of the DRC, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Uganda. In Burundi, following action review, community-based interventions that are being strengthened in areas experiencing high incident of mpox include risk communication and awareness raising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of, and the Advisor to, the Committee then engaged in questions and answers, revolving around the issues and challenges enumerated below, with the presenters from States Parties and the WHO Secretariat, as well as with representatives of States Parties invited to submit a written statement to the Committee ahead of the meeting – Canada, China, Nepal, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding – The Committee reiterated the importance of efforts to mobilize domestic financial resources to support mpox response activities. Burundi and the DRC indicated the funds allocated to the response by their respective Governments, also providing details of specific activities supported. The DRC indicated that, at present, the freeze of the funds from the United States is impacting the transportation of clinical specimens and laboratory diagnostics, with a decline in the testing rate, and that the Government is exploring solutions with other partners. The WHO Secretariat added that alternative funding sources are being explored with non-traditional donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age distribution of mpox cases – The WHO Secretariat indicated that (a) there are studies ongoing to determine the secondary attack rate by age group and type of exposure; (b) at least in Burundi, there is no evidence of large outbreaks in settings where children are congregating and, hence, supporting evidence of child-to-child transmission; and (c) in the South Kivu Proving of the DRC, it remains unknown the extent to which transmission to children is occurring beyond the household setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impact of vaccination on transmission – The DRC indicated that, at present, there is no information about whether the use of the limited amount of mpox vaccine available is being effective in interrupting mpox transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DRC – The DRC indicated that, due to insecurity and to decrease in laboratory testing rate, any apparent decrease of the number of reported mpox cases may represent an artifact and should be interpreted with caution. The WHO Secretariat highlighted that, being mpox a relatively mild illness, the rate of underreporting is unknown and that the trends of mpox surveillance data are critical to monitor the evolution of the situation. With respect to detection of a new MPXV clade Ia lineage in Kinshasa, the WHO Secretariat indicated that the strain, similarly to clade Ib, has increased human-to-human transmission potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uganda – Uganda elaborated on the shift of the dynamics of mpox transmission from lower to higher income groups. The initial spread of MPXV clade Ib initiated long-distance truck drivers, it continued in fishing communities, and then within commercial sex networks in the capital Kampala. The fact that more affluent individuals are now affected poses a public health risk both, nationally and internationally. Therefore, the use of mpox vaccine is focused among sex workers in Kampala. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria – Nigeria indicated that, in the context of the mpox response, the human health and animal health sectors are working very closely and that, despite the numerous research initiatives, to date, there is no evidence of animal involvement in sustaining the mpox outbreak in the human population. Nigeria, with a population of 200&amp;nbsp;million persons, indicated that 20&amp;nbsp;000 doses of mpox vaccine have been used in the country, targeting health care workers, female sex workers, and men who have sex with men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Arab Emirates – Considering that, in five instances, travel-related imported cases of MPXV clade Ib infection had sole travel history to the United Arab Emirates, the representative of the country (a) indicated that the National IHR Focal Point reported to WHO the first case of MPXV clade Ib infection; (b) briefly described the surveillance, laboratory diagnostic, case management, and risk communication approaches in place; (c) indicated that mpox vaccine is available to health care workers and as a post-exposure measure; and (d) recalled that the country is bilaterally supporting the response efforts of some African countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom – The United Kingdom (a) described the detection, investigation, and clinical and public health management of the travel-related imported mpox cases; and (b) highlighted that the countries of origin of the imported cases are systematically informed about the occurrences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Deliberative session&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the session open to invited States Parties, the Committee reconvened in a closed session to examine the questions in relation to whether the event constitutes a PHEIC or not, and if so, to consider the temporary recommendations drafted by the WHO Secretariat in accordance with IHR provisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chair reminded the Committee Members of their mandate and recalled that a PHEIC is defined in the IHR as an “extraordinary event, which constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease, and potentially requires a coordinated international response”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Committee was unanimous in expressing the views that the ongoing upsurge of mpox still meets the criteria of a PHEIC and that the Director-General be advised accordingly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overarching considerations underpinning the advice of the Committee are (a) the insecurity in the eastern provinces and in the capital of the DRC – the State Party epicenter of the MPXV clade Ib outbreak –, hampering mpox response field operations and with the potential to morph into a larger scale humanitarian response; (b) the freeze of funding by the United States both, of specific mpox response activities as well as of other, directly or indirectly related, aid interventions; and (c) the continuing detection of travel-related imported mpox cases in States Parties within and outside the WHO African Region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that basis, the Committee considered that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event is “extraordinary” because of (a) the persistent, if not increasing, challenges in gauging the actual magnitude and trend of the MPXV clade Ib outbreak, especially in the DRC. This is thwarting the ability to assess progress, if any, towards controlling the spread of mpox and to adjust response interventions. The Committee’s reading is that, overall, the epidemiological situation is worryingly similar to that observed in November 2024; (b) the unfolding dynamics of MPXV clade Ib transmission, resulting in the shift in age groups affected and, hence, posing challenges in timely targeting response interventions; (c) the co-circulation and the risk of mutations of MPXV clades in the context of sustained community transmission; and (d) the possibility of change in the severity of disease resulting from food insecurity and interruption in the delivery of HIV-related care due to the freeze of aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event “constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease” because of (a) the doubling of the number of States Parties having detected travel-related imported cases of MPXV clade Ib infection since the Committee last met, both in the WHO African Region and in all five other WHO Regions; (b) the possible influx of refugees from the eastern provinces of the DRC into neighbouring countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event “requires a coordinated international response” because of the needs (a) to mobilize, and optimize the use, of financial and other resources to sustain response efforts, at the required level, in the medium term, following the freeze of funding by the United States; and (b) to continue facilitating and increasing equitable access to mpox vaccines and diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Committee subsequently considered the draft of the temporary recommendations proposed by the WHO Secretariat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anticipating the possibility that the WHO Director-General may determine that the event continues to constitute a PHEIC, the Committee had received a proposed set of revised temporary recommendations ahead of the meeting. This reflected the proposal to extend most of the temporary recommendations issued on 27 November 2024. The Committee indicated that it would be giving them further consideration with a view to share its advice in that regard with the WHO Director-General as soon as possible. In such a way, should the WHO Director-General determine that the event continues to constitute a PHEIC, he could proceed, without delay, with issuing such communication together with a prospective revised set of temporary recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Committee agreed to finalize the report of its third meeting during the week of 3 March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Committee reiterated its concern regarding the continuing spread of MPXV in and beyond Africa, considering global geopolitical developments, the humanitarian situation in the DRC, as well as the foreseeable options and opportunities to secure sustainable funding to support response efforts. The Committee considered that the determination by the WHO Director-General that the upsurge of mpox still constitutes a PHEIC would be warranted. However, the Committee cautioned about the possible unintended consequences of determining an event to constitute a PHEIC for extended periods of time, since this could undermine the global public health alert function intrinsic to such a determination and reduce the leverage of a PHEIC in boosting domestic and international response efforts for future events. To that effect, the Committee reiterated the need to elaborate on considerations, related to the three criteria defining a PHEIC, that would inform its future advice to the WHO Director-General as to the termination of this PHEIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Incident Manager for mpox at WHO headquarters, on behalf of the WHO Deputy Director-General, expressed his gratitude to the Committee’s Officers, its Members and Advisor and closed the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//17-03-2025-third-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-upsurge-of-mpox-2024</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//17-03-2025-third-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-upsurge-of-mpox-2024</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:21:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Nearly 50 million people sign up call for clean air action for better health</title><description>&lt;p&gt;In an unprecedented show of unity, more than 47 million health professionals, patients, advocates, representatives from civil society organizations, and individuals worldwide have signed a resounding call for urgent action to reduce air pollution and to protect people’s health from its devastating impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air pollution is one of the biggest environmental threats to human health and a major contributor to climate change. Around 7 million people die from air pollution each year, mainly from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This global call to action, spearheaded by the World Health Organization (WHO) and international health organizations will be presented at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/events/detail/2025/03/25/default-calendar/second-global-conference-on-air-pollution-and-health/%22&quot;&gt;Second Global Conference on Air Pollution and Health&lt;/a&gt;, set to take place in Cartagena, Colombia, on 25–27 March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Forty-seven million people from the health community have issued a clarion call for urgent, bold, science-driven action on air pollution, and their voices must be heard,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Around the world, WHO is supporting countries to implement evidence-based tools to address air pollution and prevent the disease it causes. At the second WHO Conference on Air Pollution and Health in Cartagena, we hope to see concrete commitments from countries to implement those tools and save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hosted by WHO and the Government of Colombia, the conference will bring together political leaders, representatives from civil society organizations, UN agencies and academia to drive a global clean air agenda which promises benefits for public health, climate change response and sustainable development, both globally and locally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the heavy toll of air pollution, the health community is calling on governments to take immediate and ambitious steps to reduce emissions, enforce stricter air quality standards, and transition to cleaner energy sources, unlocking multiple benefits for the health of people and planet. The topic will also be a focus ahead of the 2025 UN High-Level Meeting on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), where world leaders will be called upon to take stronger action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key facts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Air pollution in both cities and rural areas generates fine particulate matter which results in NCDs such as stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, chronic respiratory diseases as well as acute conditions such as pneumonia.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Around 2.1&amp;nbsp;billion people are exposed to dangerous levels of household air pollution, while using polluting open fires or stoves for cooking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), are among the leading causes of death, many are linked to air pollution exposure. The global NCD epidemic claims 41 million lives annually. Addressing air pollution is a key strategy in reducing the burden of NCDs and improving global health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sources of air pollution are varied and context-specific. The major pollution sources include polluting energy sources used in homes, energy production, industrial emissions, transport, agriculture, waste as well as natural sources such as desert and dust storms or wildfires.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving air quality by implementing well-known and available solutions will prevent premature deaths, improve health, drive sustainable economic development, and mitigate climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the conference, countries are expected to commit to concrete measures, including setting and enforcing stronger air quality standards aligned with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789240034228/%22&quot;&gt;WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. WHO, in collaboration with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.swisstph.ch/en//%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH)&lt;/a&gt;, has unveiled the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/tools/air-quality-standards/%22&quot;&gt;updated 2025 Air Quality Standards database&lt;/a&gt; last month, which now includes data from approximately 140 countries, showcasing their air pollution regulatory efforts aimed at protecting public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the challenge is immense, progress is possible. Many cities and countries have significantly improved air quality by enforcing stricter pollution limits,” said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director for Environment, Climate Change and Health. “Clean air is not a privilege; it is a human right as recognized by the UN General Assembly. We need to work together urgently to scale up transitioning from coal-fired power to renewable energy, expanding public and sustainable transport, establishing low-emission zones in cities and promoting clean energy for cooking and solar power in healthcare facilities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commitments made at the upcoming Second Global Conference on Air Pollution and Health and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/teams/noncommunicable-diseases/on-the-road-to-2025/%22&quot;&gt;UN High-Level Meeting on NCDs&lt;/a&gt; will play a crucial role in paving the way for a healthier, more sustainable future for all. Now is the time to take the call and step up efforts for cleaner air, everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For interviews, please contact WHO Media Team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//17-03-2025-nearly-50-million-people-sign-up-call-for-clean-air-action-for-better-health</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//17-03-2025-nearly-50-million-people-sign-up-call-for-clean-air-action-for-better-health</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 08:27:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The multi-partner Access and Allocation Mechanism allocates 238 000 doses of mpox vaccine to four countries</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Following the emergence of mpox subclade Ib in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in September 2023, the World Health Organization declared mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the first allocation round in November 2024, where the &lt;a target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/initiatives/i-mcm-net/%22&quot;&gt;Access and Allocation Mechanism (AAM) &lt;/a&gt;allocated 899 000 vaccine doses to nine African countries, the AAM has allocated an additional 238 000 doses during a second allocation round. These doses will benefit four countries severely affected by the mpox surge: Angola, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Uganda. These countries are in the process of accepting the doses, and shipment arrangements are underway. These vaccines are vital in reducing transmission and containing outbreaks of mpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work of the AAM, which is a collaboration of Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention; the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; UNICEF and WHO, highlights the importance of international coordination in addressing public health emergencies. By working together, countries and organizations can ensure that medical countermeasures reach those most in need, ultimately saving lives and preventing further spread of the disease. This second allocation of mpox vaccines marks a significant step towards a coordinated and targeted response to the ongoing health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//15-03-2025-the-multi-partner-access-and-allocation-mechanism-allocates-238000-doses-of-mpox-vaccine-to-four-countries</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//15-03-2025-the-multi-partner-access-and-allocation-mechanism-allocates-238000-doses-of-mpox-vaccine-to-four-countries</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>UN Commission approves WHO recommendations to place psychoactive substances under international control</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Following recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) has decided to place five new psychoactive substances and one medicine under international control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommendations were developed by WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence--ECDD, which consists of global experts analyzing health risks and benefits of psychoactive substances circulating on global markets and alerting to include them under international control if evidence found that their use can cause harm for population health in countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These substances have been brought to WHO’s attention for being clandestinely manufactured, posing serious risk to public health and society without any recognized therapeutic use,” said Dr Deus Mubangizi, WHO Director for Health Product Policy and Standards. “We are pleased that the Commission (on Narcotic Drugs) has accepted the full set of WHO recommendations and added these substances to relevant schedules in the 1961 or 1971 Conventions. We hope countries and communities will increase vigilance and take necessary actions to protect vulnerable groups particularly youth from these substances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four substances placed in Schedule I of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961), as amended by the 1972 Protocol are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N-Pyrrolidino protonitazene&lt;/strong&gt;, also referred to as protonitazepyne, is a synthetic opioid.&amp;nbsp; It has been described as a beige powder or a white colourless or crystalline solid, and has been identified in falsified pharmaceutical opioid tablets. It is reported to be administered by various routes, including smoking, snorting and by injection. It can cause substantial harm, including death. It has no known therapeutic use. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N-Pyrrolidino metonitazene&lt;/strong&gt;, also referred to as metonitazepyne, is a synthetic opioid. It has been described as a beige powder and is reported to be administered by injection. There is evidence that its use causes substantial harm, including death. It has no known therapeutic use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Etonitazepipne&lt;/strong&gt;, also referred to as N-piperidinyl etonitazene, is a synthetic opioid.&amp;nbsp; It has been described as a crystalline solid and a yellowish-white or yellow powder. There is evidence that use of this substance causes substantial harm, including death. It has no known therapeutic use. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;text-decoration:underline;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N-Desethyl isotonitazene&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;text-decoration:underline;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;also referred to as norisotonitazene, is a synthetic opioid that has been described as a crystalline solid. It has been identified in falsified pharmaceuticals. Multiple deaths and hospital admissions have been reported in at least two regions. There is evidence that its use causes substantial harm, including death. It has no known therapeutic use. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substance placed in Schedule II of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hexahydrocannabinol&lt;/strong&gt;, also known as HHC, is a semi-synthetic cannabinoid described as a colourless viscous oil or resin. Products such as THC cannabis flowers and resins infused or sprayed with the substance, e-liquids and cartridges for electronic cigarettes, edible products such as gummies and marshmallows, tinctures resembling dietary supplements and distillate oils can include HHC. There is sufficient evidence that HHC is used in ways to constitute a public health and social problem, warranting placement under international control. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substance placed in Schedule IV of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carisoprodol &lt;/strong&gt;is&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant sold as a single-ingredient preparation and in combination products. Carisoprodol is available as a pharmaceutical product in tablet form, has been detected in falsified pharmaceuticals and is also found as a white powder. There is increasing evidence that nonmedical use of carisoprodol in a number of countries constitutes a significant risk to public health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO has been convening the ECDD as a scientific advisory body for over 70 years with the mission to protect populations from harmful substances and to ensure that psychoactive substances are available where needed for medical and scientific purposes. The ECDD conducts scientific reviews at the request of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs and is the only treaty-mandated body to provide health recommendations to the Commission to inform decisions in drug policy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the ongoing emergence of more harmful substances, including clandestinely manufactured synthetic opioids with no medical use such as fentanyl and nitazenes, Member States expressed interest in more scientific reviews of these substances by WHO in the coming period. Above-mentioned decisions were announced at the 68&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; regular session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, taking place in Vienna, Austria, on 10-14 March 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//13-03-2025-un-commission-approves-who-recommendations-to-place-psychoactive-substances-under-international-control</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//13-03-2025-un-commission-approves-who-recommendations-to-place-psychoactive-substances-under-international-control</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 15:18:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Medical Product Alert N°1/2025: Falsified (contaminated) OXYCONTIN 80mg</title><description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alert Summary &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This WHO Medical Product Alert refers to one batch of falsified OXYCONTIN 80mg (oxycodone hydrochloride). The falsified product was detected in the unregulated market in Switzerland and reported to WHO in February 2025 by the genuine manufacturer MUNDIPHARMA. The falsified product imitates genuine OXYCONTIN 80mg authorized in Poland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OXYCONTIN (oxycodone hydrochloride) is a semi-synthetic opioid indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory testing of samples of the falsified product was conducted by the Drug Information Centre of the City of Zurich (DIZ), Switzerland. DIZ’s drug checking service determined that the tablets did not contain oxycodone, but a synthetic opioid likely to be a nitazene compound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nitazene derivatives (e.g., metonitazene, isotonitazene, fluonitazene) are potent synthetic opioids, primarily used in research due to their high addiction potential and severe side-effects.&amp;nbsp; These substances can be hundreds of times stronger than oxycodone, posing a high overdose risk. Limited information is available on their risks, toxicity, side-effects, and long-term consequences. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to identify this falsified product&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This product is confirmed as falsified because it deliberately misrepresents its identity, composition, and source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The falsified product imitates OXYCONTIN 80mg manufactured and marketed by MUNDIPHARMA in the Polish market. MUNDIPHARMA has confirmed that the product, subject of this alert, is falsified and was not produced by their company&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In identifying this product as falsified, the following visible discrepancies were noted &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The placement of the batch and expiry date on the falsified product is incorrect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the falsified product the batch and expiry date are visible on the front side of the blister strip. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genuine OXYCONTIN has the batch and expiry date visible on the back of the blister strip.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the falsified product the expiry date is on the left and the batch number on the right.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genuine OXYCONTIN has the batch number on the left and the expiry date on the right. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please refer to the &lt;a target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/substandard-and-falsified/n1_2025_oxycontin_en.pdf?sfvrsn=42d676f5_6\%22&quot;&gt;Annex&lt;/a&gt; of this Alert for full details of the falsified product.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This falsified product has been found to contain undeclared nitazene compounds, which pose a significant risk due to the high likelihood of adverse events, even in small doses. Nitazenes produce effects similar to other opioids.&amp;nbsp; Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://ecddrepository.org/en/metonitazene/%22&quot;&gt;high potency&lt;/a&gt; carries a high risk of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/opioid-overdose//%22&quot;&gt;overdose&lt;/a&gt; and death. Using nitazene derivatives has been linked to several deaths. Mixing them with other depressants like alcohol or benzodiazepines can be very dangerous, leading to severe effects like respiratory depression, low blood pressure, coma, or even death. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This falsified product poses a particular risk to individuals with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/resources-for-substance-use-disorders/%22&quot;&gt;substance use disorders&lt;/a&gt; who may perceive this falsified product as a safe and quality assured medicine.

Christophe Payot, Ambassador of Belgium to the United Nations and other international organizations in Geneva&amp;nbsp;– discussed issues of strategic importance, exchanged views on how to smoothly align WHO strategic directions and Belgium&#39;s development cooperation priorities in the context of an evolving global health landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partners exchanged updates on Belgium&#39;s support to global health areas brought in the spotlight during the Belgian presidency of Council of the European Union in 2024. WHO was represented by leadership and technical experts from Headquarters and from the Regional Offices for Africa and for Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\&quot;After listening to the leaders and experts of WHO we now better understand how they are navigating these challenging times\&quot;, said Mr Koen Van Acoleyen, Minister Counselor at the Permanent Representation of Belgium to the UN. \&quot;We are honoured that we can walk this road together.\&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Accelerating equitable access to vaccines, medicines and health technologies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partners reviewed the current status and the most noticeable results achieved by the Access to Medicines programme funded by Belgium. WHO illustrated its work and challenges with an example of country-level implementation in Senegal. It also explained WHO&#39;s policies and work on equitable access and local production. Both parties recognized a shared goal for sustainability of the Access to Medicines initiative, as market shaping is key to ensure long-term success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Health emergencies and pandemic prevention, preparedness and response&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussions covered WHO&#39;s role in strengthening the global architecture for health emergency prevention, preparedness, response and resilience, including the pandemic agreement negotiations and the One Health approach. WHO&#39;s crucial field work on health emergency response was demonstrated by presenting the activities in Gaza. The debate also touched upon threats posed by acceleration of biological risks and zoonoses, along with WHO engagement, in particular, risk mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Universal Health Coverage (UHC)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elaborating on progress made on UHC-Partnership, the participants reviewed results achieved by WHO with Belgium support in the period 2021-2024, specifically in Belgium&#39;s partner countries. They discussed the way forward, exploring the potential for enhanced collaboration at country level, including eventual alignment between WHO country office programmes and Belgium&#39;s country level bilateral cooperation. Examples included a summary of the work and challenges at country level from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The visitors listened to a recap of WHO&#39;s policies and work on mental health in the context of primary health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partners also reviewed progress in other areas of collaboration on WHO programmes supported by Belgium, such as Neglected Tropical Diseases and Sexual, Reproductive Health and Rights. The review underpinned the importance of an evidence-based approach in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO appreciates Belgium&#39;s commitment and engagement, displayed by the participation of representatives of the country&#39;s Federal government as well as the Flemish and Walloon governments. \&quot;We thank you for your support, honesty, and strong engagement for global health\&quot;, said Dr Catharina Boehme, Assistant Director-General, External Relations and Governing Bodies. \&quot;Your efforts in supporting our work in Mozambique and Senegal are clear examples of the crucial work we accomplish together\&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Looking into the future&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partners discussed ways forward for the Belgium-WHO collaboration framework and multi-year agreement, including progress towards a renewed WHO-Belgium Country Cooperation Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enhanced collaboration between Belgium and WHO will support a strong global health agenda under the WHO 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; General Programme of Work (GPW14). There was a shared vision that UHC and health systems strengthening being at the heart of GPW14 ambitions will be taken as essential scope in WHO&#39;s ongoing prioritization work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\&quot;We recognize WHO as a trustworthy partner in global health. We felt proud hearing how crucial our support is to the Organization and how it is having a positive impact at country, regional, and global levels\&quot;, said Mr Dirk Brems, Director of Thematic and Multilateral Cooperation, Directorate-General Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid. \&quot;It&#39;s important we continue these discussions as we tread uncharted territories, and we look forward to working together for strong and sustained multilateralism\&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;\&amp;quot;text-align:center;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img sf-image-responsive=&quot;\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/funding/strategic-dialogue-belgium-and-who-representatives.jpg?sfvrsn=8548e3f4_3\%22&quot; height=&quot;\&amp;quot;1280\&amp;quot;&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;max-width:100%;height:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot; title=&quot;\&amp;quot;Strategic&quot; dialogue=&quot;&quot; belgium=&quot;&quot; and=&quot;&quot; who=&quot;&quot; representatives\&quot;=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;\&amp;quot;1920\&amp;quot;&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;Strategic&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;453217\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Belgian delegation from the Federal government, as well as Flemish and Walloon governments with WHO representatives, 2-5 March 2025.

In addition to underlining their commitment to global efforts to eradicate polio, Member States and key stakeholders expressed their support for the long-term sustainable transition of polio assets, knowledge and infrastructure into national health systems and recipient programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Strengthening health systems through immunization, surveillance, outbreak response and containment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;The aims of polio transition efforts are outlined in the &lt;a target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789240100633/%22&quot;&gt;polio transition strategic framework&lt;/a&gt;. The polio transition process focuses on sustaining the polio investments – the tools, knowledge and infrastructure built to eradicate polio over the past decades – to keep the world polio-free and build strong, resilient and equitable health systems. Since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was established in 1988, the polio eradication programme has become a critical backbone of public health in some of the most challenging contexts worldwide. Sustaining the essential functions of strong immunization, sensitive surveillance, rapid outbreak response and robust containment of polioviruses following the eradication of polio is important to prevent the disease returning, and to strengthen broader public health.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several Member States commented on the progress being made on polio transition in priority countries. Somalia discussed work being undertaken by the government to increase the capacity of frontline polio health workers to undertake vaccine delivery and surveillance for other diseases. Meanwhile, Norway voiced their support for the implementation of the polio transition agenda, especially where infrastructure and personnel can be leveraged to reach zero-dose children and strengthen primary health care. Action plans for transition are tailored to local context, with progress monitored through regular &lt;a target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/teams/polio-transition-programme/monitoring-and-evaluation-dashboard/%22&quot;&gt;monitoring and evaluation&lt;/a&gt; to enable course corrections.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;color:inherit;font-family:&#39;Open&quot; sans=&quot;&quot; condensed&#39;,=&quot;&quot; sans-serif;font-size:var(--font-size-h3);font-weight:bold;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\&quot;=&quot;&quot;&gt;Robust systems through eradication and beyond&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Speakers also emphasized the potential for polio transition and integration to strengthen national health systems. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, stressed the importance of integrating polio-funded assets into existing national health systems, a move that is critical for sustaining immunization gains and fortifying overall health security, a key global health priority. Meanwhile, Canada supported the strengthening of country capacity and the provision of technical assistance and training to Member States to enable them to independently support the polio essential functions. Indonesia, where significant work has been undertaken on transition, called for sustainable financing to secure polio essential functions for the long term. This is especially important given the challenging contexts where much of the polio eradication infrastructure is located.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Another theme was the steps required to prevent any future resurgence of the virus. The polio post-certification strategy (PCS), which sets out the technical standards to sustain a polio-free world, is currently undergoing revision. Thailand endorsed the revision process, which enables new technologies and best practices to be reflected in the document. Several countries also emphasized the importance of working collaboratively, particularly to maintain strong surveillance, during the post-certification era. The post-certification strategy has three core aims: to protect populations, to detect and respond to a polio event or outbreak, and to contain poliovirus. These aims are aligned with the polio transition strategic framework. Sustainable transition, including strong country ownership and financing, will be central to help lay the groundwork for the implementation of the PCS.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Across their comments, Member States called for continued collaboration, investment, and country-driven leadership to achieve eradication, ensure a sustainable transition, and plan for post-certification. Joint efforts and a strong focus on implementation are key to achieving and sustaining a polio-free world and building stronger, resilient and equitable health systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//10-03-2025-member-states-support-polio-transition-progress-at-156th-executive-board</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//10-03-2025-member-states-support-polio-transition-progress-at-156th-executive-board</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 15:04:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>World Health Day 2025: explore free courses to enhance maternal and newborn health</title><description>&lt;p&gt;World Health Day, celebrated on 7 April 2025, will launch a year-long campaign focused on maternal and newborn health.

target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-marked=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; released today by the World Health Organization (WHO). These conditions were responsible for around 80 000 and 50 000 fatalities respectively in 2020 – the last year for which  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789240068759/%22&quot;&gt;published estimates&lt;/a&gt; are available - highlighting that many women still lack access to lifesaving treatments and effective care during and after pregnancy and birth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the Lancet Global Health, the study is WHO’s first global update on the causes of maternal deaths since the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals were adopted in 2015. In addition to outlining the major direct obstetric causes, it shows that other health conditions, including both infectious and chronic diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, anaemias, and diabetes, underpin nearly a quarter (23%) of pregnancy and childbirth-related mortality. These conditions, which often go undetected or untreated until major complications occur, exacerbate risk and complicate pregnancies for millions of women around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding why pregnant women and mothers are dying is critical for tackling the world’s lingering maternal mortality crisis and ensuring women have the best possible chances of surviving childbirth,” said Dr Pascale Allotey, Director of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research at WHO as well as the UN’s Special Programme on Human Reproduction (HRP). “This is also a massive equity issue globally - women everywhere need high quality, evidence-based health care before, during and after delivery, as well as efforts to prevent and treat other underlying conditions that jeopardize their health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, there were an estimated 287 000 maternal deaths in total – equivalent to one death every two minutes. This new WHO study reports that haemorrhage - mostly occurring during or following childbirth - is responsible for nearly a third (27%) of maternal mortality, with preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders contributing to an additional 16%. Preeclampsia is a serious condition characterized by high blood pressure that can lead to haemorrhage, strokes, organ failures and seizures if left untreated or treated too late. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other direct causes include: sepsis and infections; pulmonary embolism; complications from spontaneous and induced abortions - including miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, and issues relating to unsafe abortions – and, anesthetic complications and injuries that occur during childbirth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight the need to strengthen key aspects of maternity care, including antenatal services that detect risks early in pregnancy and prevent severe complications; lifesaving obstetrics that can manage critical birth-related emergencies like haemorrhage or embolism, and postnatal care. Most maternal deaths occur during or shortly after childbirth, making this a critical window to save lives. However, around a third of women – primarily in lower income countries - still do not receive essential postnatal checks in the first days after birth. &amp;nbsp;At a population level, broader preventive interventions could help reduce the prevalence of underlying health conditions - like noncommunicable diseases and malnutrition - that increase women’s risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Often not just one but many interrelated factors contribute to a woman dying during or after pregnancy– preeclampsia for instance can significantly increase the likelihood of haemorrhage as well as other complications that may occur even long after childbirth,” said Dr Jenny Cresswell, Scientist at WHO and an author of the paper. “A more holistic approach to maternal health has been proven to give women the best chance of a healthy pregnancy and birth, and of enjoying lasting quality of life after delivery – health systems need to be able to support them across different life stages.”&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study draws on national data that is reported to WHO, as well as peer-reviewed studies. For some causes, data remains limited. In particular, the authors call for more data on maternal suicide, which is currently available for only 12 countries. In addition, most countries do not report on late maternal deaths (those that occur in the year following childbirth), although several conditions can lead to risks lasting much beyond the birth itself. After childbirth, many women  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news/item/07-12-2023-more-than-a-third-of-women-experience-lasting-health-problems-after-childbirth/%22&quot;&gt;struggle to access follow-up care&lt;/a&gt;, including mental health support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO works to strengthen access to high quality, respectful services across the continuum of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news/item/07-11-2016-new-guidelines-on-antenatal-care-for-a-positive-pregnancy-experience/%22&quot;&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news/item/12-10-2023-improving-the-experience-of-pregnant-and-birthing-women/%22&quot;&gt;childbirth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news/item/30-03-2022-who-urges-quality-care-for-women-and-newborns-in-critical-first-weeks-after-childbirth/%22&quot;&gt;postnatal care&lt;/a&gt;, through evidence-based research and guidelines. In 2024, WHO and partners launched a global  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news/item/11-10-2023-who-issues-global-plan-to-tackle-leading-cause-of-death-in-childbirth/%22&quot;&gt;Roadmap for Postpartum Haemorrhage&lt;/a&gt;, which outlines key priorities for tackling this major cause of maternal death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same year, the World Health Assembly’s 194 countries passed a  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news/item/30-05-2024-countries-commit-to-recover-lost-progress-in-maternal--newborn---child-survival/%22&quot;&gt;Resolution&lt;/a&gt; committing to strengthen quality care before, during and after childbirth. To galvanize action, World Health Day 2025 – which marks five years from the Sustainable Development Goals deadline—will focus on maternal and newborn health. The campaign will call for a major intensification of efforts to ensure access to high quality, proven care for women and babies, especially in the poorest countries and crisis settings where the vast majority of deaths occur. Beyond survival, the campaign will also showcase the need for broader attention to women’s health, including postnatal care and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, Global and regional causes of maternal deaths 2009-2020: a WHO systematic analysis, updates a previous analysis conducted in 2014 which covered the period 2003-2009.

However, harnessing its benefits for good requires collaboration from stakeholders committed to robust governance, ethical safeguards, and evidence-based policies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;color:inherit;font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;The WHO Collaborating Centre designation recognizes the Digital Ethics Centre at Delft University of Technology&#39;s decades-long history of cutting-edge research on responsible innovation, and its leadership in incorporating ethical values into design requirements for digital technologies. This inauguration marks the continuation of a strong partnership between the Digital Ethics Centre and WHO with the two entities jointly organizing international consultations, workshops, and the development of normative guidance and training in the past.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“WHO is committed to helping Member States plan, govern, and adopt responsible AI technologies,” said Dr Alain Labrique, Director of Digital Health and Innovation at WHO. “We are witnessing remarkable progress, with AI poised to transform health systems and support individuals on their health journeys. To ensure these benefits reach everyone ethically, safely, and equitably, we rely on strong technical and academic partnerships that guide us in this rapidly evolving field.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Collaborating Centre on AI for health governance will be instrumental in WHO’s efforts to ensure the ethical and responsible use of AI for health by advancing research on priority topics and providing expert input for WHO’s guidance development and policy-making. The Centre will serve as a hub for education and advocacy for science-driven research and facilitate knowledge-sharing and training through regional and country-level workshops.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fruit of two decades of research in digital ethics and responsible innovation, the Delft Digital Ethics Centre is one of the frontrunners in operationalizing ethical values into design requirements for digital technologies such as artificial intelligence,\&quot; Professor Jeroen van den Hoven, Scientific Director at Delft Digital Ethics Centre noted.&lt;strong&gt; \&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;We look forward to contributing to the global health community and advancing the responsible use of AI in health.\&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Responsible and Ethical AI for Healthcare Lab, a collaboration between Delft University of Technology and its partners, will provide valuable insight into the challenges involved in the successful implementation of WHO guidance in clinical practice.&amp;nbsp;\&quot;The designation of the Digital Ethics Centre at Delft University of Technology as a WHO Collaborating Centre strengthens our collective ability to ensure AI serves public health equitably and responsibly.

The missions, led by WHO’s Division of Data, Analytics and Delivery for Impact, together with WHO’s Department of Social Determinants of Health, explored lessons learned on how to overcome industry interference across critical public health issues including tobacco, alcohol, health-harming foods, sugary beverages and road safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participating countries discussed a number of shared challenges, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;aligning economic objectives &amp;nbsp;with public health goals;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;putting public health before commercial interests in complex situations, including where there are challenges with enforcement; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;addressing gaps in conflict-of-interest policies, rules and approaches; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;addressing industry tactics to undermine health, including non-compliance, obfuscation and coalition-building.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common challenge presented during the missions was the structural power imbalances that make smaller countries vulnerable to industry interference by large transnational commercial actors. This has been previously identified as an area for increased WHO support to countries and is a topic being addressed through global and regional initiatives to support Small Island Developing States (SIDS) including in a forthcoming WHO technical paper on the Economic and commercial determinants of health in Small Island Developing States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries also highlighted opportunities for progress, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;strengthening multi-sectoral collaboration and whole-of-government approaches to address the commercial determinants of health;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;building capacity to counter misinformation and implement conflict-of-interest safeguards; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;working with WHO to support evidence-based advocacy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO will strive to provide targeted technical assistance, support capacity-building, and foster a global community of practice on the commercial determinants of health to these and other countries to protect health, promote well being and save lives. &lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//05-03-2025-advancing-the-healthier-populations-billion-with-multi-country-virtual-missions-on-tackling-industry-interference</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//05-03-2025-advancing-the-healthier-populations-billion-with-multi-country-virtual-missions-on-tackling-industry-interference</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 15:34:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Funding cuts impact access to TB services endangering millions of lives</title><description>&lt;p&gt;In the past two decades, tuberculosis (TB) prevention, testing and treatment services have saved more than 79&amp;nbsp;million lives – averting approximately 3.65&amp;nbsp;million deaths last year alone from the world’s deadliest infectious disease. This progress has been driven by critical foreign aid especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly from USAID. However, abrupt funding cuts now threaten to undo these hard-won gains, putting millions – especially the most vulnerable – at grave risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on data reported by national TB programmes to WHO and reporting by the United States of America government to the creditor reporting system of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United States government has provided approximately US$&amp;nbsp;200–250 million annually in bilateral funding for the TB response at country level. This funding was approximately one quarter of the total amount of international donor funding for TB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2025 funding cuts will have a devastating impact on TB programmes, particularly in LMICs that rely heavily on international aid, given the United States has been the largest bilateral donor. These cuts put 18 of the highest burden countries at risk, as they depended on 89% of the expected United States funding for TB care. The WHO African Region is hardest hit by the funding disruptions, followed by the WHO South-East Asian and Western Pacific Regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any disruption to TB services – whether financial, political or operational – can have devastating and often fatal consequences for millions worldwide,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of WHO’s Global Programme on TB and Lung Health. “The COVID-19 pandemic proved this, as service interruptions led to over 700&amp;nbsp;000 excess deaths from TB between 2020 and 2023, exacerbated by inadequate social protection measures. Without immediate action, hard-won progress in the fight against TB is at risk. Our collective response must be swift, strategic and fully resourced to protect the most vulnerable and maintain momentum toward ending TB.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;TB response in peril: essential service disruptions escalate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandated by heads of state, WHO plays a crucial leadership role in guiding countries toward the End TB targets for 2027 and 2030. Early reports to WHO from the 30 highest TB-burden countries confirm that funding withdrawals are already dismantling essential services, threatening the global fight against TB. This includes health and community workforce crises with thousands of health workers in high-burden countries facing layoffs, while technical assistance roles have been suspended, crippling national TB programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug supply chains are breaking down due to staff suspensions, lack of funds and data failures, jeopardizing access to TB treatment and prevention services. Laboratory services are severely disrupted, with sample transportation, procurement delays and shortages of essential consumables halting diagnostic efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data and surveillance systems are collapsing, undermining routine reporting and drug resistance monitoring. Community engagement efforts – including active case finding, screening and contact tracing – are deteriorating, reducing early TB detection and increasing transmission risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without immediate intervention, these systemic failures will cripple TB prevention and treatment efforts, reverse decades of progress and endanger millions of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, USAID, the world&#39;s third-largest TB research funder, has halted all its funded trials, severely disrupting progress in TB research and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHO commitment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these challenging times, WHO remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting national governments, civil society and global partners in securing sustained funding and integrated solutions to safeguard the health and well-being of those most vulnerable to TB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//05-03-2025-funding-cuts-to-tuberculosis-programmes-endanger-millions-of-lives</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//05-03-2025-funding-cuts-to-tuberculosis-programmes-endanger-millions-of-lives</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Lifelong learning in health: a global outlook from the WHO Academy</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Opened in December 2024, the WHO Academy is moving ahead with it ambition to become the global centre for lifelong learning in health. Last month, it held its inaugural conference in Lyon, France, where learning and health experts from around the world gathered to discuss the role of quality in health learning, training and capacity building. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no widely accepted global standards for high-quality learning courses in health. Building on the World Health Organization’s 75 years of expertise in setting global norms and standards, the WHO Academy aims to promote quality assurance standards in developing, implementing and evaluating learning materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Quality is essential, and it is a key word for the entire operation of the Academy. Providing health and care workers with continuous access to upscaling and rescaling learning is crucial to achieving health for all,” explained Dr David Atchoarena, WHO Academy Executive Director, who also highlighted the Academy’s commitment to bringing together global expertise on learning in public health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her keynote address, Professor Asha Kanwar from Beijing Normal University stressed the urgent need to address the projected global shortfall of 11 million healthcare workers by 2030. She also advocated for integrating technology into lifelong learning, including AI-generated and interactive content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A round table discussion featured global learning and health experts who shared best practices and success stories on improving learning opportunities and implementing online and blended courses. Through a series of in-person workshops in the afternoon, participants shared their inputs on the localization of learning content, the potential of team-based learning and assessments, and what learning recognition of WHO Academy courses could look like to ensure they are well-received by ministries of health or public accreditation bodies in their own contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is necessary to construct a shared vision for lifelong learning. Lifelong learning is a right for health workers. Health workers are committed to their training, so we have to take advantage of that. We need to make lifelong learning more relevant for their careers and ensure their training is more relevant. It is not a personal possession but a collective good,” explained conference participant Isabel Dure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Janusz Janczukowicz from the Medical University of Lodz, Chair of the WHO Academy Quality Committee, concluded the conference by reiterating the importance of interprofessional and team-based learning in providing inclusive and high-quality patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO Academy will promote the incorporation of best practices in learning in the design and delivery of training across WHO to optimize the impact of lifelong learning. The insights from the conference will inform the WHO Academy Quality Standards and Criteria for Learning Programmes,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which will be published in 2025.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The WHO Academy offers a range of free courses on its global online platform, open to anyone who would like to register at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://whoacademy.org//%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;whoacademy.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//04-03-2025-lifelong-learning-in-health--a-global-outlook-from-the-who-academy</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//04-03-2025-lifelong-learning-in-health--a-global-outlook-from-the-who-academy</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 15:39:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Harnessing innovation and fostering responsible use of life sciences</title><description>&lt;p&gt;In response to the rapid developments in life sciences and emerging technologies, ease of access, diversity of actors and sectors, and gaps in governance of biorisks from dual-use research of concern (DURC), WHO facilitated an online meeting of partners, collaborators, and other stakeholders on 3 December 2024.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This highlight was originally published on the WHO India website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/india/news/detail/04-03-2025-harnessing-innovation-and-fostering-responsible-use-of-life-sciences/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Access the story here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//04-03-2025-harnessing-innovation-and-fostering-responsible-use-of-life-sciences</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//04-03-2025-harnessing-innovation-and-fostering-responsible-use-of-life-sciences</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 13:50:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Recommendations announced for influenza vaccine composition for the 2025–2026 northern hemisphere influenza season</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) today announced the  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/m/item/recommended-composition-of-influenza-virus-vaccines-for-use-in-the-2025-2026-nh-influenza-season/%22&quot;&gt;recommendations for the viral composition of influenza vaccines for the 2025–2026 influenza season in the northern hemisphere&lt;/a&gt;.

Held as a closed meeting at WHO Headquarters, Members of the three organizations shared experiences on supporting sustainable innovation ecosystems through health, trade and IP. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The imperative to adopt an integrated approach to issues at the crossroads of health, IP and trade has been at the heart of the longstanding collaboration among the three Geneva-based organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments and policymakers are faced with the challenging task of identifying the right mix of policy options to best advance domestic policy objectives to facilitate sustainable innovation. Participants discussed how to facilitate ongoing domestic and regional policy discussions through a more coherent and comprehensive approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members with diverse levels of development and from different regions of the world shared valuable experiences about the implementation of laws and policies in support of sustainable innovation ecosystems and access to the outcomes. This was followed by a roundtable discussion and further complemented by information provided by the three organizations on trilateral and other relevant work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO-WIPO-WTO Technical Assistance virtual Platform was also briefly introduced at the meeting. It allows Members to easily request joint technical assistance from the three organizations to access the full range of expertise at the intersection of health, trade, and IP in a coordinated manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trilateral Briefing series is a set of closed meetings for Members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next briefing session for Geneva-based health, IP and trade attachés is tentatively scheduled to take place in September 2025, after the summer break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/headquarters/teams/access-to-medicines-and-health-products-(mhp)/health-product-policy-and-standards-(hps)/medicines-selection-ip-and-affordability-(mia)/who-wipo-wto-technical-assistance-platform.jpg?sfvrsn=9821b9b2_2\%22&quot; style=&quot;\&amp;quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;&quot; class=&quot;\&amp;quot;sf-immutable-selected&quot; -align-center\&quot;=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;47495\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//28-02-2025-who--wipo--and-wto-hold-first-joint-briefing-for-geneva-based-officials</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//28-02-2025-who--wipo--and-wto-hold-first-joint-briefing-for-geneva-based-officials</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 12:14:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>New WHO and ITU standard aims to prevent hearing loss among gamers</title><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid=&quot;\&amp;quot;121969221\&amp;quot;&quot; paraeid=&quot;\&amp;quot;{38b51478-2599-4f1b-9559-62b185c5efb3}{195}\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Ahead of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-hearing-day/2025/%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; rel=&quot;\&amp;quot;noreferrer&quot; noopener\&quot;=&quot;&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/campaigns/world-hearing-day/2025/%22&quot;&gt;World Hearing Day 2025,&lt;/a&gt; the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) are highlighting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-H.872-202410-I/en/%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; rel=&quot;\&amp;quot;noreferrer&quot; noopener\&quot;=&quot;&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;first global standard for safe listening in video gameplay and esport activities&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to reduce the risk of and prevent hearing loss among gamers.

People with such asymptomatic forms of TB (aTB) may only be identified during screening with so-called symptom-agnostic tools like chest X-ray or during TB prevalence surveys. Recent reviews found that about one half of people with TB detected by prevalence surveys had bacteriologically confirmed disease but reported no typical TB symptoms upon inquiry. More research is now ongoing to better characterize the full spectrum of TB, from infection to disease.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest in aTB has increased in recent years as more emphasis is being placed on screening and earlier diagnosis. The World Health Organization’s End TB Strategy stresses the importance of TB screening and active case-finding for TB in the first component of its first pillar.&amp;nbsp;In 2021, WHO released updated evidence-based recommendations for systematic TB screening, alongside an operational handbook and new tools to facilitate implementation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We urge national programmes, technical agencies, funding partners, civil society and other stakeholders to work collectively to ensure that all people with TB, including asymptomatic TB, are detected early and receive appropriate treatment. Systematic screening will be critical for countries to achieve global targets on TB,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of the WHO Global Programme on Tuberculosis and Lung Health.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;WHO convened a technical consultation on 14–15 October 2024 in Geneva to agree on a framework and definition of aTB relevant for TB programmes and research, and to identify research gaps on aTB and set priorities that are critical for WHO guidance. The results of this consultation are summarized in the report being released.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//28-02-2025-who-consultation-on-addressing-asymptomatic-tb-in-the-tb-response</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//28-02-2025-who-consultation-on-addressing-asymptomatic-tb-in-the-tb-response</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Humanitarian access improves quality of polio vaccination campaign in the Gaza Strip</title><description>&lt;p&gt;A five-day mass polio vaccination campaign in the Gaza Strip concluded on Wednesday, reaching nearly 603 000 children under 10 years of age with novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) following comprehensive, simultaneous access to all five governorates during the ongoing ceasefire. The campaign was conducted as part of emergency efforts to end an ongoing poliovirus outbreak and prevent further spread in the Gaza Strip.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;During this round, an additional 40 000 children were vaccinated as compared to the previous two rounds conducted in September and October 2024, after poliovirus was detected in the Gaza Strip. The ceasefire enabled health workers to reach more children who had missed vaccinations due to displacement during the phased approach, living in areas that previously required special coordination for access, or being unreachable during the October 2024 round due to insecurity in North Gaza, including Jabalia, Beit Lahiya, and Beit Hanoun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong community engagement and awareness of vaccination benefits had maintained high immunization rates in the Gaza Strip, where 89% of children received the third dose of oral polio vaccine in 2023, before the conflict.&amp;nbsp; This round drew upon 1660 vaccination teams, 1242 of which were mobile, and deployed 1242 social mobilizers. Despite bad weather conditions, families welcomed the initiative and brought their children to points where they could receive the polio vaccine.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The campaign was conducted by the Palestinian Ministry of Health and implemented with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), and other partners. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As part of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative’s commitment to mount a robust poliovirus outbreak response, surveillance for disease in children and for virus circulation in the environment has also been intensified since July 2024. It was this timely surveillance that detected ongoing environmental circulation of the virus, and the need to conduct additional vaccination to protect children.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As the ceasefire provides an opportunity to resume critical public health functions, working to recover Gaza’s previously strong disease surveillance and routine immunization are the best ways to protect children from polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases. Ending polio hinges on fully vaccinating every last child with polio vaccines.&amp;nbsp; Ensuring uninterrupted access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene, and proper nutrition will protect children from many diseases including polio.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;WHO, UNICEF and partners continue to call for a lasting ceasefire that leads to long-term health and peace.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//28-02-2025-humanitarian-access-improves-quality-of-polio-vaccination-campaign-in-the-gaza-strip</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//28-02-2025-humanitarian-access-improves-quality-of-polio-vaccination-campaign-in-the-gaza-strip</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 06:52:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Third meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee regarding the upsurge of mpox 2024 – Temporary recommendations</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), following the third meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR)  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/groups/mpox-ihr-emergency-committee-2024/%22&quot;&gt;Emergency Committee regarding the upsurge of mpox 2024&lt;/a&gt;, held on 25 February 2025, from 12:00 to 17:00 CET, concurs with its advice that the event continues to meet the criteria of a public health emergency of international concern and, considering the advice of the Committee, he is hereby issuing a revised set of temporary recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;The WHO Director-General expresses&amp;nbsp;his most sincere gratitude to the Chair,&amp;nbsp;Members, and Advisors of the Committee.

However, abrupt disruptions to foreign aid and service delivery threaten these gains, putting millions of people at risk – especially people living with HIV and key and vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many essential evidence-based prevention interventions, including HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), harm reduction services for people who inject drugs, and community-led programmes have been permanently halted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early reports shared with WHO indicate that prevention and treatment services for key populations are those most affected. Reports include the closure of health centres delivering prevention, testing and treatment interventions for key populations previously supported by U.S. funding. These disruptions are resulting in staffing shortages, supply chain interruptions, and increased barriers to access, leaving key populations – including gay men and other men who have sex with men, sex workers, people who inject drugs, people in prisons, and trans and gender diverse individuals – vulnerable to infection and death, as well as increased stigma and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These developments compromise the ability of service providers to deliver on foundational WHO recommendations that:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;all people living with HIV should receive same-day antiretroviral treatment (ART) both to improve their health and to prevent further transmission by achieving sustained viral load suppression;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;there should be uninterrupted access to ART for all populations, including key populations living with HIV, during service disruptions; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;person-centred approaches should be implemented and non-judgemental, discrimination-free environments created to foster trust, encourage consistent engagement in care, and support re-engagement for those who may have dropped out of treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Essential prevention services must remain a priority&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuring that key populations can access prevention services that are free of discrimination is central to HIV, hepatitis and STI responses. Community-based services have consistently proven effective in increasing access and acceptability of programmes, buffering the effects of stigma and discrimination. These programmes facilitate the delivery of interventions that have been proven effective through rigorous scientific research, and that are recommended by WHO to protect people from new infections and harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core WHO-recommended essential prevention services include condoms and lubricants; testing for HIV, hepatitis B and C, and other STIs; HIV post-exposure prophylaxis and pre-exposure prophylaxis; and harm reduction activities including distribution of needles and syringes, of naloxone to prevent deaths from overdose, and opioid agonist maintenance treatment programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Commitment to sustainable financing and integrated health systems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As countries and ministries of health work to mitigate the impact of service disruptions, they must pursue long-term solutions, including sustainable domestic financing to protect these vital health services. This is essential for maintaining the downward trend in HIV incidence and mortality, and to progress toward hepatitis elimination and STI control.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO also emphasizes the value of an integrated approach to HIV, bringing together stigma and discrimination-free services for tuberculosis, viral hepatitis, sexual and reproductive health, and noncommunicable diseases under the umbrella of strong primary health care. Integrating HIV leads to resource optimization and improvements in overall population health.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO remains committed to supporting national governments, community and civil society&amp;nbsp;partners, and donors in adapting to shifting donor support to safeguard the health and well-being of those most vulnerable to HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Editor’s note&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This departmental update was amended on 3 March 2025 to include \&quot;community and civil society\&quot; in the last paragraph.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//27-02-2025-protecting-key-populations-from-abrupt-disruptions-to-essential-hiv-services</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//27-02-2025-protecting-key-populations-from-abrupt-disruptions-to-essential-hiv-services</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>New WHO partnership with Indian Institute to advance technology transfer and health equity</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The WHO Health Technology Access Programme (HTAP), the WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia and the WHO Country Office for India met with the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) at the Institute’s campus in Trivandrum, Kerala, India, on 12—13 February 2025 following the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the two organizations in January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visit and technical discussions mark an important milestone in facilitating the transfer of selected technologies from institutions with a public health mandate to HTAP and subsequently to suitable manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTAP’s mission is to bridge the health technology access gap by providing an evidence-driven mechanism for selecting, securing and facilitating the geo-diversified transfer of existing technologies. In the long run, it also seeks to build end-to-end product development capacity in LMICs through global and regional health technology consortia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussions focused on potential technology candidates and key areas for potential collaboration, including education and training, technology transfer and the business incubation unit designed to allow small startups the opportunity to develop projects, informed by interactions with SCTIMST scientists, if requested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCTIMST is a unique publicly funded institution that carries research and development of prioritized medical technologies all the way to proof of concept while also providing the necessary support for technology transfer. Fields of research discussed in detail during the visit include biomaterials, biomedical engineering, in vitro diagnostics,&amp;nbsp;other medical devices&amp;nbsp;and assistive technologies, which&amp;nbsp;jointly contribute to&amp;nbsp;a growing list of technologies that have now been commercialized in India and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MOU with SCTIMST will support HTAP’s vision of establishing a global network of public institutions that could provide technologies under transparent, non-exclusive licenses, addressing critical access gaps in underserved regions. This effort is guided by a robust prioritization process that considers both need and the likelihood of success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A two-year workplan is currently being developed to translate the objectives of the MoU into concrete, actionable activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTAP, which builds on lessons learned from the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP), remains focused on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. At the same time, it promotes access to health products that address existing public health priorities by actively targeting platform technologies and other essential health products relevant both during and beyond health emergencies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/headquarters/initiatives/health-technology-access-pool-(htap)/technical-discussions-on-technology-transfer-with-who-htap-and-sctimst-delegations-and-agappe.jpg?sfvrsn=eaf976a6_4\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;Photo&quot; of=&quot;&quot; delegations=&quot;&quot; during=&quot;&quot; the=&quot;&quot; meeting\&quot;=&quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;628423\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From left to right: Dr Anoop Kumar, Scientist, molecular medicine, SCTIMST, Dr Madhur Gupta, Technical officer, WHO Country Office for India, Mr Einstein Kesi, Medical device expert, WHO HTAP, Dr Dragana Milic, Diagnostics and medical device expert, WHO HTAP, Mr Michael Ward, Senior technical specialist, WHO HTAP, Mr Jofy Paul, Vice president, R&amp;amp;D-Reagent, Agappe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/headquarters/initiatives/health-technology-access-pool-(htap)/who-htap-and-sctimst-delegations-meet-to-strengthen-collaboration.jpg?sfvrsn=bccc93f7_2\%22&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; sf-size=&quot;\&amp;quot;697035\&amp;quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From&amp;nbsp;left to right:&amp;nbsp;Mr Einstein Kesi, Medical device expert, WHO HTAP, Dr Roy Joseph, Scientist, Polymeric medical devices, SCTIMST, Dr Sanjay Behari, Director, SCTIMST, Dr Anoop Kumar, Scientist, molecular medicine, SCTIMST, Mr Michael Ward, Senior technical specialist, WHO HTAP, Dr Madhur Gupta, Technical officer, WHO Country Office for India, Dr Jayasree RS, Scientist, biophotonics and imaging, SCTIMST, Mr Nagesh DS, Scientist, extracorporeal devices, SCTIMST, Dr Manikandan S, Deputy director, SCTIMST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//26-02-2025-new-who-partnership-with-indian-institute-to-advance-technology-transfer-and-health-equity</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//26-02-2025-new-who-partnership-with-indian-institute-to-advance-technology-transfer-and-health-equity</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 12:33:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>WHO unveils updated global database of air quality standards</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.swisstph.ch/en//%22&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;text-decoration:underline;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.swisstph.ch/en//%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH)&lt;/a&gt;, has unveiled the updated 2025 Air Quality Standards database. This resource compiles national air quality standards for major pollutants and other airborne toxics from countries worldwide. This latest update provides an overview of global efforts towards achieving the WHO global air quality guidelines, with 17% more countries now implementing standards for pollutants that pose a risk to human health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\&quot;The updated WHO Air Quality Standards database is a crucial tool highlighting global progress in setting air quality regulations to protect public health,\&quot; says Dr Maria Neira, Director, Environment, Climate Change and Health at the World Health Organization. “It provides essential data for evidence based policymaking, helping to reduce air pollutions impacts on communities worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on previous efforts, the updated database now includes data from approximately 140 countries from all WHO regions, showcasing their air pollution regulatory efforts aimed at protecting public health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The database is presented as an interactive tool, providing values for both the short and long-term standards for particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;and PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and carbon monoxide (CO). These values are based on averaging times that align with WHO’s global air quality guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO air quality guidelines as a tool to protect health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO guidelines were published in 2021 to reflect new evidence of the health effects of air pollution. The guidelines recommend lower air quality levels to protect populations, underscoring the need for countries to implement stricter standards and policies to mitigate air pollution and its associated health risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health sector has a critical role to play to promote public health protection through effective air quality governance. Involving the health community in the development of national air quality standards as well as in processes ensuring that air quality standards are embedded in legislation is key to maximize public health protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopting air quality standards as best buys to prevent noncommunicable diseases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental risks account for a quarter of the disease burden worldwide – with air pollution alone being responsible for almost 7 million deaths. Many of these deaths are preventable through policies in the energy, transport, agriculture, household, industry and other sectors. Air pollution has been recognized as a major risk for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), impacting not only the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, but many more other organs and systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The costs of air pollution on the health systems are substantial, and it jeopardizes the health of the most vulnerable such as children, who are affected throughout their entire life course, as well as people with pre-existing diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By compiling national air quality standards into a single, comprehensive database, WHO aims to empower stakeholders such policy makers, public health officials, researchers and other civil society and health organizations with the information necessary to monitor progress, drive policy changes and support the implementation of effective interventions to improve air quality and safeguard public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time to commit for clean air and health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopting stricter air quality standards embedded in legislation is the first step – a required best buy – countries can do to commit to combat NCDs and other health outcomes.

Building on the success of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://whofoundation.donorsupport.co/page/FUNEKRBXNHP/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;1 Dollar 1 World campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the World Health Organization (WHO) is now amplifying and evolving the initiative to encourage more people around the world to show their solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by an individual’s initiative, WHO is now backing the 1 Dollar 1 World movement, encouraging regions, countries, champions, and its own workforce to unite behind the effort. Together with the WHO Foundation, WHO will strengthen its efforts to create awareness about its critical work and engage communities worldwide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this initiative, WHO is embracing a new approach by leveraging crowdfunding to support its mission. For the first time, WHO is activating its existing infrastructure – spanning 150 country offices – alongside the WHO Foundation’s reach, to amplify this grassroots movement. This strategic shift not only strengthens community engagement but also aligns with WHO’s broader strategy to diversify funding sources and support its ongoing Investment Round.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its launch in early 2025, almost 5000 people from over 140 countries have contributed to the campaign through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://who.foundation//%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;WHO Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, created to bring together funders and high impact health initiatives to further the mission of WHO. The high level of success and engagement demonstrates that there is a broad sense of solidarity and shared commitment to global health. This campaign is not just about crowdfunding – it’s about people standing together to remind us that health is a right, not a privilege.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;“The power of the 1 Dollar, 1 World movement comes from the people. In particular, I would like to thank my colleague Tania Cernuschi for her inspiration to launch this initiative,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “It shows that in times of crisis, people everywhere can unite and commit to protecting and promoting the health of others. WHO is proud to stand behind this initiative, which embodies the values of solidarity, action, innovation and hope.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A moment for action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenges global health has faced in recent years – from pandemics to humanitarian crises – make it clearer than ever that no one is safe until everyone is safe. The 1 Dollar 1 World movement is a chance for people everywhere to turn concern into action and show that solidarity, just like health, knows no borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This campaign started with one person, but it belongs to all of us,” said Tania Cernuschi, the WHO staff member who launched the original initiative. “It’s proof that individuals can make a difference, and that together, we are stronger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join the movement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media and the public are invited to support and share this movement. Every action – whether a donation, a post, or a conversation – helps spread the message that health should be for all, not just for some. Every stakeholder – whether a person, an organization, a community or a government – has a role in building efficient and effective collaboration for health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A grassroots campaign with global impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1 Dollar 1 World movement invites everyone to take action for global health in three simple ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://whofoundation.donorsupport.co/page/FUNEKRBXNHP/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Donate&lt;/a&gt; through the WHO Foundation – Every dollar counts.

This global capacity-building workshop was organized with the Social Inclusion of Persons with Mental Disabilities Project and supported by the Turkish Ministries of Health and Family and Social Services, with financial support from the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, European Union and the United States Agency&amp;nbsp;for International Development. The workshop brought together over 60 humanitarian professionals, emergency responders, and mental health leaders across 26 countries and 6 continents to strengthen MHPSS readiness for emergencies and improve community resilience globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A global commitment&amp;nbsp;to responding efficiently in emergencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2024, the World Health Assembly took a significant step by passing a resolution to strengthen MHPSS as a fundamental component of emergency response strategies. This resolution underscored a global commitment to ensuring that 80% of countries establish comprehensive MHPSS preparedness systems by 2030. WHO’s workshop and simulation exercise in Ankara advanced this commitment, equipping participants with the skills needed to incorporate MHPSS support into disaster and emergency response plans, with a focus on timely, collaborative action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Fahmy Hanna, Technical Officer, WHO, emphasized the importance of investing in MHPSS operational readiness: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\&quot;Investing in MHPSS operational readiness is not a luxury; it is a necessity and a smart investment. The lessons of COVID-19 and natural disasters have shown that every dollar spent on preparedness can save at least ten in future humanitarian response costs. Failing to prioritize mental health preparedness is a risk we cannot afford. Through the Build Better Before workshop, Türkiye has demonstrated a forward-thinking approach that sets a powerful example for the global community.\&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interactive training sessions and skills development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first two days of the event featured practical training, fostering skills in MHPSS strategies adapted for diverse sectors and settings. WHO’s curriculum, informed by the IASC MHPSS Reference Group, addressed the needs of professionals in national disaster risk management, emergency response and technical MHPSS working groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uğur Avşar from Presidency of Strategy and Budget of Türkiye highlighted the workshop’s practical impact:&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;\&quot;This workshop was a turning point in understanding how MHPSS can be seamlessly integrated into emergency response planning. The field visits and discussions with sectoral teams provided a practical dimension to the learning experience.\&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-sectoral simulation for real-world application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solidify these learnings, participants engaged in a two-day multi-sectoral simulation&amp;nbsp;exercise replicating real-life emergency conditions. Scenarios included simulated emails, news videos, professional actors, site visits and social media challenges, requiring attendees to strategize responses, coordinate with counterparts, and manage communication across sectors.

Each year, it draws attention to a specific health topic of concern to people all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The focus of this campaign comes at a crucial moment, aiming to help countries regain lost progress while showcasing new research and evidence that will enhance the health of women and babies globally,” said Dr Anshu Banerjee, Director of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and Ageing at WHO. “As rollbacks to humanitarian assistance jeopardize a critical lifeline for millions, it will also be an opportunity to step up support and collaboration for global health - and deliver hope to those in urgent need of lifesaving care.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping every woman and baby survive and thrive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the most recent estimates, close to 300 000 women lose their life due to pregnancy or childbirth each year; over 2 million babies die in their first month of life, and around 2 million more are stillborn. This is roughly 1 preventable death every 7 seconds – losses which bring tremendous sadness and heartache to millions of families around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While maternal and newborn deaths occur in all regions, the vast majority are in the poorest countries and those facing conflict and other crises. When health care facilities close, facilities are attacked, access routes denied or supplies disrupted, pregnant women and babies - who need regular access to health services - face severe, often life-threatening risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on current trends, a staggering 4 out of 5 countries are off track to meet the United Nations’ global targets for improving maternal survival by 2030; 1 in 3 will fail to meet targets for reducing newborn deaths. Current funding constraints could further jeopardize progress, as many programmes providing critical health services have stalled alongside important medical research focused on pregnant and breastfeeding women and children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s campaign, which will run until 2026, will urge governments, donors and the health community to invest in proven, high-impact interventions, as part of efforts to improve overall quality of care. These include pregnancy related services to detect complications and lifesaving emergency obstetrics – noting that the vast majority of maternal and newborn deaths happen during or shortly after birth – as well as special care for small and preterm babies. Complications relating to prematurity are now the leading cause of death of children under-5 worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO will also highlight the evolving need for health systems to address the many underlying health issues that impact maternal and newborn health. These include not only direct obstetric complications but also mental health conditions, malnutrition (including under and overnutrition as well as nutritional deficiencies), and an increasing burden of noncommunicable diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listening to women and supporting families&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moving beyond actions to save lives, the campaign will urge increased global attention to women’s longer-term health and well-being. This includes advocating for laws and policies that safeguard their health and rights, such as paid maternity leave and other critical employment protections, and access to vital family planning services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is not sufficient that women survive childbirth, they must also be able to enjoy their lives in good health,” said Dr Pascale Allotey, Director for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research at WHO. “Women and girls everywhere need access to health providers who listen to their concerns and meet their needs, while ensuring they can plan their fertility, take charge of their futures, and protect their health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Efforts are also needed to address &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/news/item/05-06-2024-experts-warn-of-serious-health-impacts-from-climate-change-for-pregnant-women--children--and-older-people/%22&quot;&gt;the particular risks of climate change&lt;/a&gt; for pregnant women and newborns,&amp;nbsp; as evidence shows an association between higher temperatures and preterm births, stillbirth, hypertension and gestational diabetes, as well as infant mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An investment, not a cost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In low- and middle-income countries, every US$1 invested in maternal and newborn health &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://pmnch.who.int/resources/publications/m/item/investing-in-maternal-newborn-and-child-health/%22&quot;&gt;is estimated&lt;/a&gt; to yield around US$9 to 20 in return. Evidence shows that spending on maternal and newborn health leads to economic development and happier, healthier societies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the world, WHO is supporting essential maternal and newborn health programmes including through:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intensive support to 55 countries through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://ewene.org//%22&quot;&gt;Every Woman Every Newborn Everywhere initiative&lt;/a&gt;, which is working to expand access to lifesaving emergency obstetric and newborn care units, family planning and other critical services;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Guidance relating to diverse aspects of maternal and newborn health through pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period. &amp;nbsp;New recommendations will be published later this year to help clinicians manage &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/teams/sexual-and-reproductive-health-and-research-(srh)/areas-of-work/maternal-and-perinatal-health/postpartum-haemorrhage/%22&quot;&gt;postpartum haemorrhage&lt;/a&gt;, one of the world’s leading causes of maternal deaths, and noncommunicable diseases in pregnancy;

target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Expanded Programme on Immunization &lt;/a&gt;(EPI) – saving an estimated 154 million lives and adding over 10 billion years of healthy life. Through strong partnerships and countries’ commitments vaccines have reached every corner of the world and became the single greatest contribution of any health intervention to ensuring babies not only see their first birthdays but continue leading healthy lives into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2025 marks a significant turning point for immunization efforts worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/events/detail/2024/01/01/default-calendar/50th-anniversary-of-the-expanded-programme-on-immunization-(epi)/%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;we celebrated&lt;/a&gt; the remarkable progress made by the global immunization community since 1974. Each year, new and under-utilized vaccines continue to be introduced in countries. In 2024, four new countries introduced HPV vaccines and 25 adopted the single-dose schedule. Additionally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news/item/12-04-2024-in-world-first--nigeria-introduces-new-5-in-1-vaccine-against-meningitis/%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Niger and Nigeria became the first countries to implement the Men5CV vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, a new and affordable meningococcal pentavalent conjugate vaccine, and more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/feature-stories/detail/life-saving-malaria-vaccines-reach-children-in-17-endemic-countries-in-2024/%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;12 million doses of malaria vaccine &lt;/a&gt;reached 17 countries in Africa in 2024 – a pivotal moment in the fight to end malaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789240075511/%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Big Catch-up Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, a major vaccine co-financing initiative in collaboration with Gavi and UNICEF, began reaching children left unvaccinated as a result the pandemic. By the end of 2024, an estimated 143 million vaccine doses had been delivered to 36 countries and 10.5 million catch-up doses had already been administered. This year, an additional 104 million doses will be delivered as part of the Big Catch-up, and a new WHO global monitoring dashboard is enabling real-time data tracking to continually strengthen countries strategies and our support to them. The midway point of the Immunization Agenda 2030 is upon us. As we look towards the next five years there are challenges ahead, but the goal is more relevant than ever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;text-decoration:underline;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Five immunization priorities for 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equity: Reaching Zero-Dose Children&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine equity remains one of the most urgent global health challenges of our time. While immunization programs have made tremendous progress, millions of children worldwide remain unreached—many of whom are classified as zero-dose children, meaning they have not received a single vaccine. In 2023, 14.5 million children had received no vaccines at all, a sharp increase from 12.9 million in 2019. These children are disproportionately from marginalized communities, including those in conflict zones, remote areas, and urban slums. The gap in coverage not only fuels preventable disease outbreaks but also deepens existing inequalities in health outcomes. Closing this gap requires targeted strategies: improving supply chains, strengthening healthcare infrastructure, and addressing socioeconomic barriers that prevent families from accessing vaccination services. Achieving true equity means ensuring that no child is left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outbreaks: The Resurgence of Measles and System Strengthening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine-Preventable Disease surveillance is another pillar of global health security. From yellow fever to measles to pneumonia, early detection ensures vaccines reach those who need them most. The alarming rise in measles cases is a stark reminder of result when immunization networks are weakened. Once considered on the path to elimination in many regions, measles is resurging due to gaps in vaccine coverage. This increase is a warning signal that vaccination systems are at risk—delayed campaigns, supply chain disruptions, and weakened trust in health services have created the basis for outbreaks. Strengthening immunization programmes is not just about responding to crises but about intense work to build resilient health systems so those crises are averted in the first place. This means enhancing surveillance, ensuring robust stockpiles of vaccines, training health workers, assuring data systems are in place to drive impact and intensifying essential immunization services. A failure to act decisively now could see other vaccine-preventable diseases following the same dangerous trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccine Confidence: Strengthening Trust Among Communities and Health Workers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confidence in vaccines is the backbone of successful immunization efforts. The past few years have exposed both the strengths and vulnerabilities of public trust in vaccines. Misinformation, historical mistrust, and political instability threaten to erode hard-won gains. At the same time, frontline health workers—the trusted faces of vaccination—must be supported with training and resources to confidently engage with communities. Trust must be built through transparency, education, and engagement. Governments, civil society, and the private sector must work together to counter misinformation and misrepresentation, amplify accurate information, and ensure that communities feel empowered, not coerced, in vaccine decision-making. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Vaccines: Innovation, Hope, and the Need for Strong Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innovation in vaccines brings immense opportunity for tackling some of the world’s deadliest diseases. The introduction of new vaccines—whether for malaria, RSV, or the next pandemic threat—represents a turning point in public health. &amp;nbsp;New vaccines are only as impactful as the systems that deliver them. The success of these vaccines hinges not just on their development but on their effective introduction and sustained delivery. This is where our role supporting countries is critical: ensuring that regulatory approvals, financing mechanisms, health system readiness, and community acceptance are in place. Investing in the introduction of these vaccines with the same urgency as their research and development will be key to translating scientific breakthroughs into real-world protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding and political challengers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order indicating the United States’ intent to withdraw from WHO. We remain hopeful that the US will reconsider. For decades, the partnership between the US and WHO has been instrumental in achieving historic public health milestones—from the eradication of smallpox to advancing global immunization efforts that have saved millions of lives in the US and around the world. This collaboration has protected Americans at home and abroad through disease surveillance, accelerating scientific progress, and ensuring that life-saving health interventions reach those who need them most, and shutting down outbreaks when they emerge, to limit their impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global health security is a shared responsibility. Infectious diseases do not respect borders, and the challenges we face—whether responding to outbreaks, developing new vaccines, or ensuring equitable access to healthcare—require international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO remains committed to its mission and will continue working with partners to strengthen global health systems. Strong leadership and sustained funding are critical to ensuring immunization programmes remain resilient. However, the political landscape for vaccines is increasingly unpredictable, putting decades of progress at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving Forward Together: A Moment for Global Health Cooperation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two upcoming meetings will be pivotal in providing critical guidance for future immunization policies and strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/events/detail/2025/03/10/default-calendar/strategic-advisory-group-of-experts-on-immunization-march-2025/%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE)&lt;/a&gt; will meet 10-13 March 2025, to advance global immunization policies and priorities. Key discussions will focus on IA2030 progress, pneumococcus vaccine schedules, varicella-zoster vaccination, new vaccine introductions, NITAG strengthening, and global polio eradication policy decisions and mpox updates. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/events/detail/2025/03/25/default-calendar/sixth-global-vaccine-and-immunization-research-forum-(gvirf)/%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Global Vaccine and Immunization Research Forum &lt;/a&gt;(March 25-27, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) will convene experts from around the world to advance vaccine innovations, sustainable R&amp;amp;D investments, Artificial Intelligence applications to vaccine development, climate-related challenges to immunization, and equitable access to vaccines. Key discussions will highlight Latin American advancements, maternal and new TB vaccines, vaccine role to reduce antimicrobial resistance, and clinical trial innovations for immunization.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In closing, I want to thank Member States, partners, and all those in the global health community for the resilient commitment and focus on immunization, driven always by high quality evidence, science and impact. Now is the time to remain committed and sharpen our focus so that immunization for all is a reality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world has the tools, knowledge, and capacity to protect future generations through vaccines. Political will and global solidarity are more valuable than ever to make that happen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the words of Dr. Albert Sabin, \&quot;A scientist who is also a human being cannot rest while knowledge which might be used to reduce suffering rests on the shelf.\&quot; Let’s ensure that decades of progress are not left behind, but are built upon. It is in our hands. It is Humanly Possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;----&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://confirmsubscription.com/h/d/4BC833B1BCA2AAC0/%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe to the Global Immunization Newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid=&quot;\&amp;quot;2076995910\&amp;quot;&quot; paraeid=&quot;\&amp;quot;{b8478662-e542-4234-9619-cf81406a2667}{184}\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//20-02-2025-message-by-the-director-of-the-department-of-immunization--vaccines-and-biologicals-at-who---january-february-2025</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//20-02-2025-message-by-the-director-of-the-department-of-immunization--vaccines-and-biologicals-at-who---january-february-2025</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 13:19:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Mass polio vaccination campaign to continue in the Gaza Strip</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The emergency polio outbreak response in the Gaza Strip is continuing, with a mass vaccination campaign scheduled from 22 to 26 February 2025. The novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) will be administered to over 591 000 children under 10 years of age to protect them from polio. This campaign follows the recent detection of poliovirus in wastewater samples in Gaza, signaling ongoing circulation in the environment, putting children at risk.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pockets of individuals with low or no immunity provide the virus an opportunity to continue spreading and potentially cause disease. The current environment in Gaza, including overcrowding in shelters and severely damaged water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure, which facilitates fecal-oral transmission, create ideal conditions for further spread of poliovirus. Extensive population movement consequent to the current ceasefire is likely to exacerbate the spread of poliovirus infection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two previous vaccination rounds in the Gaza Strip were successfully conducted in September and October 2024, reaching over 95% of the target. As poliovirus is found to remain in the environment, additional vaccination efforts are needed to reach every child and strengthen population immunity. The presence of the virus still poses a risk to children with low or no immunity, in Gaza and throughout the region. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, health workers faced significant challenges accessing certain areas of central, north and south Gaza, which required special coordination to enter during the conflict. In inaccessible areas such as Jabalia, Beit Lahiya, and Beit Hanoun, where humanitarian pauses for the vaccination campaign were not assured, approximately 7 000 children missed vaccination during the second round. The recent ceasefire means health workers have considerably better access now. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No additional polio cases have been reported since a ten-month-old child was paralyzed in August 2024, but the new environmental samples from Deir al Balah and Khan Younis, collected in December 2024 and January 2025, confirm poliovirus transmission. The strain detected is genetically linked to the poliovirus detected in the Gaza Strip in July 2024.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upcoming vaccination campaign aims to reach all children under 10 years of age, including those previously missed, to close immunity gaps and end the outbreak. The use of the oral polio vaccine will help end this outbreak by preventing the spread of the virus. An additional polio vaccination round is planned to be implemented in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;The campaign will be led by the Palestinian Ministry of Health and implemented with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and other partners.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polio vaccines are safe and there is no maximum number of times a child should be vaccinated. Each dose gives additional protection which is needed during an active polio outbreak.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO, UNICEF, and partners welcome the recent ceasefire and urge for a lasting ceasefire that leads to long-term peace. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//19-02-2025-mass-polio-vaccination-campaign-to-continue-in-the-gaza-strip</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//19-02-2025-mass-polio-vaccination-campaign-to-continue-in-the-gaza-strip</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 19:24:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Leaders make new road safety commitments, endorse new declaration to reduce road deaths</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Leaders from around 50 countries made new national commitments to advance road safety at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.roadsafetymorocco.com//%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Fourth Global Ministerial Conference on Road Safety &lt;/a&gt;that was hosted by the Kingdom of Morocco and the World Health Organization (WHO) in Marrakech, Morocco today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Road crashes kill nearly 1.2 million people each year, more than two deaths per minute, and are the leading cause of death among children and young people aged 5-29 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers from 100 countries endorsed the  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/un-road-safety-collaboration/marrakech-declaration-en.pdf?sfvrsn=261f4417_3\%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Marrakech Declaration &lt;/a&gt;that calls on governments to make road safety a political priority, ensure sustained funding and advance actions to achieve the goal of halving road deaths by 2030 as set out in the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021-2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\&quot;We are proud to have hosted this&amp;nbsp; Global Ministerial Conference in Marrakech, mobilizing UN member states and our international partners around an issue that concerns us all. As Africans in particular and as active members of the international community, we must celebrate this milestone. Every decision made here must translate into lives saved,\&quot; said Mr. Abdessamad Kayouh, Minister of Transport and Logistics of the Kingdom of Morocco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key commitments made at the conference include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thailand’s pledge to bring road deaths down to 12 per 100,000 people by 2027.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bangladesh will enact the country’s first national road safety law.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saudi Arabia will update the country’s national road safety strategy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colombia will ensure more cities will have speed limits of 50kmh and 30kmh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Guinea will ratify the African Charter on Road Safety and align regulations with international standards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cote d’ivoire aims to increase helmet wearing among motorcyclists to 90% by 2027.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The United Kingdom will produce its first national road safety strategy in over a decade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Concrete commitments to move further and faster to save lives and boost road safety are just what we need to meet the goal of halving road deaths by 2030, and we’ve achieved that here. We commend the countries that made these commitments and we thank the Kingdom of Morocco for their leadership in hosting this crucial event. WHO is here to assist all countries in preventing deaths on the roads,” said Dr Etienne Krug, WHO Director for the Department of the Social Determinants of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Marrakech Declaration calls for safety to be a primary concern in all road infrastructure planning and related policies, laws and regulations. It calls for greater coordination across government ministries, including health, transport and the environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The declaration urges governments to adopt policies and infrastructure that advance safe, green and equitable mobility, such as walking, cycling and public transport. It recognizes that safe and accessible mobility drives equitable economic growth across society.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The declaration also calls for more cross-border knowledge-sharing, technical support and technology transfer, and to advance research into emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). It highlights the need to work with civil society and academia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//19-02-2025-global-leaders-make-new-road-safety-commitments--endorse-new-declaration-on-action-to-reduce-road-deaths</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//19-02-2025-global-leaders-make-new-road-safety-commitments--endorse-new-declaration-on-action-to-reduce-road-deaths</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>WHO launches new technical brief on encephalitis</title><description>&lt;p&gt;WHO has published a new technical brief on  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240106475/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-marked=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;encephalitis&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;, a serious, life-threatening neurological condition characterized by inflammation of the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encephalitis affects people across all age groups, has high mortality and often leads to significant long-term complications (sequelae) including hearing loss, seizures, limb weakness, and difficulties with vision, speech, language, memory and communication. Globally in 2021, encephalitis was the fourth leading cause of neurological health loss (i.e. disability-adjusted life years, DALYs) in children aged under 5&amp;nbsp;years and the 13th across all age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many different pathogens can cause encephalitis. Herpes simplex (HSV) is the most common cause of encephalitis globally. Autoimmune encephalitis, an inflammatory brain disorder driven by the immune system, is also increasingly recognized as a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some pathogens are spread by mosquitoes and ticks (vector-transmitted). Others can be prevented by vaccines, including influenza, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), rabies, poliomyelitis and encephalitis linked to measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). Some pathogens, like Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), are both transmitted by vectors and can be prevented through vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encephalitis is a growing global concern due to population density, intensive farming, climate change, vaccine hesitancy, and human-animal proximity, especially in under-resourced communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical brief, which forms part of the implementation of the broader &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240076624/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders&lt;/a&gt; (IGAP), draws attention to the lack of access to essential care, especially in low-and middle-income countries.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, people living with encephalitis and associated disabilities continue to have difficulties accessing treatment and rehabilitation, and many also experience discrimination and human rights violations, further underscoring the need for urgent action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brief covers the diagnosis, treatment and care of encephalitis (i.e. care pathways; diagnosis; treatment; care, including social protection and welfare; rehabilitation; and an interdisciplinary workforce). It also addresses surveillance and prevention (i.e. vaccines and vector control), and research, advocacy and awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\&quot;Encephalitis is a growing public health challenge, and by prioritizing it within global and national health agendas and strengthening collaboration, we can reduce its impact and save lives,\&quot; said Dr Tarun Dua, Head of the Brain Health Unit, WHO. \&quot;These efforts will not only improve health outcomes and quality of life for those affected and their families but also result in stronger more resilient health systems.” &lt;/p&gt;This technical brief is based on evidence from a WHO-commissioned scoping review &amp;nbsp;and discussions held at a WHO-convened meeting, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240069176/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Why encephalitis matters?&lt;/a&gt; with people with lived experience and carers, academics, researchers and service providers.  &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;\&amp;quot;_com_1\&amp;quot;&quot; language=&quot;\&amp;quot;JavaScript\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;\&amp;quot;_com_3\&amp;quot;&quot; language=&quot;\&amp;quot;JavaScript\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//17-02-2025-who-launches-new-technical-brief-on-encephalitis</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//17-02-2025-who-launches-new-technical-brief-on-encephalitis</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 15:20:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>World leaders gather to reduce road deaths, boost road safety</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Leaders, ministers and officials from over 100 countries are set to advance commitments and actions to strengthen road safety worldwide at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.roadsafetymorocco.com//%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Fourth Global Ministerial Conference on Road safety&lt;/a&gt; that will be hosted by the Kingdom of Morocco and the World Health Organization (WHO] in Marrakech this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaders are set to endorse the ‘Marrakech Declaration on Global Road Safety’ which urges countries to make road safety a political priority and boost&amp;nbsp;actions to achieve the goal of halving global road deaths by 2030 as set out in the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021-2030 and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Road crashes kill nearly 1.2 million people each year, which is more than two deaths every minute. Road crashes cost most countries around 3 to 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP) and transport accounts for around a quarter of the world’s harmful greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Road safety is a priority for people, planet and prosperity. It underpins individual opportunity and sustainable development globally. The Marrakech Declaration calls for a step-change in efforts to reduce road deaths and ensure safe and sustainable mobility for everyone. No road deaths are ever acceptable, or necessary, and we must double-down on our efforts to apply proven solutions,” said Mr Abdessamad Kayouh, Minister of Transport and Logistics for the Kingdom of Morocco.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Marrakech Declaration calls on governments to implement all recommendations set out in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/global-plan-for-the-decade-of-action-for-road-safety-2021-2030/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021-2030&lt;/a&gt;, including strengthening laws, safety regulations and coordination across government. The Global Plan calls for more cross-border knowledge-sharing, technical support, technology transfer and research into emerging technologies, as well as efforts to make walking, cycling and public transport more accessible for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Road deaths are preventable and making roads safe for everyone is within our reach. We know what to do, and this conference marks a clear call to urgent action. Leaders are making new commitments and advancing actions&amp;nbsp;to save more lives but much more still needs to be done,” said Dr Etienne Krug, WHO Director of the Department for the Social Determinants of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/teams/social-determinants-of-health/safety-and-mobility/global-status-report-on-road-safety-2023/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;WHO Global Status Report on Road Safety (2023)&lt;/a&gt; shows that road deaths fell slightly to 1.19 million per year in 2021, which was a 5% reduction in fatalities since 2010. More than half of all UN Member States reported a decline in deaths over this period and 10 of these countries managed to halve deaths in the last 10 years, showing that a 50% reduction in a decade is possible. 35 of these countries reduced the number of deaths by between 30 and 50% between 2010 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fourth Global Ministerial Conference on Road Safety takes place in Marrakech, Morocco on 18-20 February, with the theme of \&quot;Commit to Life\&quot;.

These epidemics have significantly impacted women and their babies. However, it is important to know more about how disease outbreaks affect these populations in order to create informed policies, as well as clinical guidance for effective prevention and treatment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789240096318/%22&quot;&gt;Roadmap for research on maternal and perinatal health in the context of epidemic threats&lt;/a&gt; provides a comprehensive strategy to address the unique challenges pregnant women and babies face during epidemics. The Roadmap seeks to fill gaps in what we know by fostering thorough research, the sharing of findings and by delivering actionable solutions to improve outcomes for women and their babies during health emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Roadmap is grounded in a vision of a world where every pregnant woman and baby, no matter where they live or their economic situation, receives the highest standard of care during and after pregnancy – even in the most challenging of times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Four key areas for action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Roadmap calls on a wide range of stakeholders – including researchers, policymakers, health workers, international organizations and community advocates – to join forces in four main strategic areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;improve coordination and collaboration: streamlining global research efforts to ensure effective use of resources, enhance surveillance, and share knowledge;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;advocate for change: raising awareness, securing funding and partnerships to prioritize the health and well-being of pregnant women and their babies during epidemics;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;build research and surveillance capacity: enhancing skills, tools and infrastructure to better study how epidemics impact pregnant women and their babies, and generate high-quality evidence - including through standardized outcome measurement; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;optimize timely use of evidence: by disseminating and encouraging wide accessibility and use of scientific knowledge by policymakers, health workers, researchers and women themselves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development of this Roadmap followed a rigorous, systematic process, including comprehensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://gh.bmj.com/content/9/3/e014393/%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;analyses &lt;/a&gt;of existing maternal and perinatal health research, and several consultative meetings with a wide range of stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO and HRP work to generate the evidence needed to better understand the effects of epidemics on women’s health, women’s perceptions and needs, and to improve relevant health system responses. Guided by this Roadmap, and in strong collaboration with all stakeholders, they will advance research, offer technical support to countries and develop guidance so that sexual and reproductive health services can be prioritized when emergencies occur.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//14-02-2025-guiding-maternal-and-perinatal-health-research-during-global-pandemics</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//14-02-2025-guiding-maternal-and-perinatal-health-research-during-global-pandemics</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>WHO releases 2025 update to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) has released the 2025 edition of the International Classification of Diseases 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Revision (ICD-11) – a tool that standardizes the language used by health professionals worldwide in diagnosing, reporting and monitoring diseases, injuries and causes of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The update includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;new features designed to improve interoperability, accuracy and ease of use in national health systems (e.g. advanced NLP and API-based coding);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;improved error detection with enhanced spelling correction and language variation recognition, reducing errors in data entry;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;multilingual expansion, available in &lt;strong&gt;14 languages&lt;/strong&gt;, with ongoing expansion to improve global accessibility;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;interoperability with external standards: ICD-11 seamlessly integrates with Orphanet, MedDRA, and other terminologies and classifications; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a new module covering traditional medicine conditions of Ayurveda and related traditional medicine systems, including Siddha and Unani, will enable systematic tracking of traditional medicine services, enhancing global research, reporting and evidence-based policymaking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ICD is a flagship WHO product that serves as the basis for identifying health trends and statistics at country level and worldwide. ICD is at the foundation of WHO&#39;s Fourteenth General Programme of Work efforts to accelerate progress towards health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), addressing inequalities and achieving relevant national health targets. Every day, vital and life-saving decisions in clinical, administrative, policy and research settings are guided by the common terminology defined in ICD-11.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICD-11 also influences the availability of financial protection and social insurance, as health insurers’ reimbursements depend on ICD coding. Moreover, the classification of diseases has an immeasurable impact on how society’s views and behaviours towards diseases and health conditions are shaped; how people seek and receive health care; how providers respond; and what policies surround the provision of care. For example, when diseases of the immune system were re-classified and given more focus in ICD-11, it helped health practitioners address autoimmune disorders based on the most current knowledge and evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A digital future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICD-11 enhances global health communication by providing a standardized classification and terminology for seamless integration across health information systems, languages and settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the new updates, the ICD-11 offers more ease of use, improved interoperability and accuracy, which will benefit national health systems and the people they serve,” said Dr Robert Jakob, Team Leader, Classifications and Terminologies Unit, WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICD-11 is designed for flexibility when working in non-digital settings, while its 2025 edition facilitates countries to embrace digital innovation and enhance their health systems. The 2025 edition of ICD-11 takes is a major step forward with FHIR API integration and advanced natural language processing (NLP). These innovations enable seamless, real-time data exchange across health systems, making coding faster, more accurate, and less disruptive to patient care. With this&amp;nbsp;intuitive design and smarter automation, health workers can focus on what matters most, while training requires fewer resources and less time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With every annual update, ICD-11 further reflects progress in science and medicine on which billions of people across the world rely for their health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ICD-11 is now available in 14 languages and expansion is underway to further improve global accessibility.

These therapies can offer significant benefits in efficacy, safety, and convenience, compared to conventional medicines. However, their high costs have limited accessibility for many patients globally. Biosimilar versions of biologic medicines are now helping to change this landscape by providing more affordable treatment options, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where the burden of disease is high, and healthcare budgets are constrained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding biosimilars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biologics are complex medicines derived from living organisms. Their complex manufacturing processes have traditionally limited their availability, primarily serving high-income countries. In recent years, biopharmaceutical manufacturing capacity has grown faster in middle-income countries, increasing the potential for broader access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biosimilars are highly similar versions of biologic medicines, developed through comprehensive analytical studies and rigorous preclinical and clinical trials to ensure therapeutic equivalence. These products offer equally effective and safe alternatives thereby increasing market competition and reducing the costs of biologic therapies (1). Biosimilars are about 60 % cheaper than their originator counterparts (2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biosimilars offer significant cost savings, which can expand access to essential biologic therapies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHO’s role in promoting biosimilars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes biosimilars as key drivers for expanding global access to essential biological medicines. Through its Essential Medicines List (EML), WHO evaluates and includes quality-assured biosimilars, endorsing them as safe, effective, and cost-effective alternatives to originator biologics. The WHO prequalification of biosimilars builds confidence for their procurement by the United Nation (UN) agencies and countries, enhancing their availability and affordability. WHO also advocates for non-exclusive voluntary licensing to accelerate affordable biosimilar access and emphasizes the importance of regulatory harmonization, healthcare professional education, and stakeholder collaboration in promoting biosimilar use (3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Standards for biological products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since early 1950s’ WHO has played a pivotal role in establishing norms and standards for biological products. These standards ensure the consistent quality, safety, and efficacy of biological medicines and related in vitro biological diagnostic tests worldwide. The WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization (ECBS) collaborates with international scientific and professional communities, regional and national regulatory authorities, manufacturers, and expert laboratories to develop these standards based on international consensus. WHO guidelines and recommendations for biological products cover various aspects, including production, control, and regulatory preparedness. This guidance is crucial for maintaining high standards in the development and use of biological products, including biosimilars. For instance, the guidelines on the quality, safety, and efficacy of biotherapeutic products provide a framework for evaluating biosimilars at country level, ensuring they meet the same rigorous standards as their reference products. WHO also establishes International Biological Reference Materials, which serve as benchmarks for the quality and potency of biological products (i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/biologicals/blood-products/catalogue/who-catalogue-with-ecbs-link_mhra.pdf?sfvrsn=fc055271_3\%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;WHO International Reference Standards for Biological Products&lt;/a&gt;). These reference materials are essential for standardizing assays and ensuring the comparability of biosimilar products across different regions and manufacturers. WHO emphasizes the importance of regulatory harmonization to facilitate the global adoption of biosimilars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Biosimilars in the EML: bridging the gap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 2023, the WHO EML includes 81 biologic therapies, representing over 15% of all listed essential medicines. The inclusion of biosimilars on the EML helps bridge the gap in affordability and availability of these therapies. For example, following the EML recommendation and WHO prequalification of trastuzumab and rituximab biosimilars treatment costs for breast cancer and lymphoma have significantly reduced. Countries such as Brazil (4), India (5), and South Africa (6) have successfully expanded patient access through approved biosimilars, demonstrating the practical benefits of these inclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Evolution of biologic medicines in the EML &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recognizes the importance of expanding access to essential biologic medicines globally. In 2013, bevacizumab (recommended for age-related macular degeneration, a disease of the eye) was the first monoclonal antibody added to the WHO EML, followed by trastuzumab and rituximab in 2015, both indicated against cancer. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trastuzumab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;has revolutionized breast cancer treatment for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. Since its introduction almost 25 years ago, trastuzumab has significantly improved outcomes for patients with this type of cancer. It is a monoclonal antibody that targets the HER2 protein, which is overexpressed in some breast cancers, and it has been pivotal in reducing recurrence and improving survival rates. Trastuzumab&#39;s impact is reflected in the shift from conventional chemotherapy to targeted therapies, offering more effective and less toxic treatment options. However, with an average annual cost exceeding $20,000 USD, many LMICs faced severe budget constraints, leading to limited use of trastuzumab and poor survival rates for patients. In response, WHO prequalified the first trastuzumab biosimilar in 2019. These biosimilars, offering the same efficacy and safety at approximately 65% lower cost, had the potential to transform breast cancer treatment in LMICs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since then, several trastuzumab biosimilars have been approved or are in development by various companies. These biosimilars have been launched in all WHO regions. The inclusion of these biosimilars on the EML facilitated initiatives such as the Cancer Access Partnership, led by the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) and the American Cancer Society (ACS), which included biological medicines for the first time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today, equitable global access to trastuzumab biosimilars is gradually being realized. Countries like India and Brazil have swiftly integrated these biosimilars into their national healthcare systems. India, for example, has approved multiple trastuzumab biosimilars, significantly reducing treatment costs and broadening patient access nationwide. Similarly, South Africa has adopted trastuzumab biosimilars into its treatment protocols, enhancing accessibility to essential breast cancer medications for patients. Overall, trastuzumab biosimilars have received market authorization and approval in at least 65 countries, signaling a major step forward in global cancer care (7).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;As of 2019, trastuzumab biosimilars have received market authorization and approval in over 65 countries (8).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2019 inclusion of adalimumab (recommended for rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn&#39;s disease) further underscored WHO’s commitment to improving access and affordability through biosimilars. Over the next few years, WHO has built on this biosimilar precedent by continuing to add further important biologic medicines to the EML and explicitly listing their quality-assured biosimilars as alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Removing barriers to adoption&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While biosimilars have made promising inroads into the Model List, concerns have persisted regarding interchangeability and switching between reference biologics and their biosimilar versions. In 2021, after reviewing substantial evidence confirming the safety and efficacy of transitioning patients from original biologics to biosimilars, the WHO recommended that quality-assured biosimilars of listed biologic medicines should also be viewed as interchangeable and considered for national selection and procurement. This recommendation was pivotal for improving real-world access and use, positioning biosimilars as equal to their reference counterparts and affirming confidence in transitioning patients to save costs without compromising care. The committee reinforced this support by recommending the expansion of WHO prequalification to include biosimilars and advocating for their regular evaluation alongside originators (9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends that quality-assured biosimilars of EML-listed biologic medicines should be viewed as interchangeable and eligible for selection and procurement at the country level for national essential medicines lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their potential, challenges remain in integrating biosimilars in clinical practice across countries and clinical areas. Issues such as concerns about switching between biosimilars and reference products, regulatory complexities, and educational gaps among healthcare professionals necessitate careful consideration (10). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Current landscape of essential biologic and biosimilar medicines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2023 Model List includes multiple biologics and their biosimilar alternatives across different therapeutic areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table 1: Biologic medicines and therapeutic alternatives (including quality-assured biosimilars) on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://list.essentialmeds.org//%22&quot;

&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adalimumab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(therapeutic alternatives: certolizumab   pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab)&lt;/em&gt;

Regulatory barriers, lack of awareness among healthcare professionals, and limited manufacturing capabilities in certain regions can hinder the widespread acceptance and utilization of biosimilars. Addressing these challenges requires coordinated efforts among governments, healthcare providers, and the pharmaceutical industry to promote education, streamline regulatory processes, and invest in local manufacturing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO continues to play a pivotal role in promoting the adoption of biosimilars through its strategic initiatives. WHO emphasizes the importance of regulatory harmonization and supports countries in building robust regulatory frameworks to ensure the quality, safety, and efficacy of biosimilars. Additionally, WHO collaborates with various stakeholders to enhance healthcare professional education and public awareness about the benefits of biosimilars, fostering a more receptive environment for their adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;References&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agency EM.

This condition disproportionately affects young children, women and girls, impacting 3 out of 10 women and 4 out of 10 children globally. It is most prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, where the lack of access to diagnosis and treatment can increase the risk of infections and death, cause extreme fatigue, lead to poor pregnancy outcomes, contribute to lost earnings, and impede growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anaemia is an indicator of overall health, with its causes ranging from nutritional deficiencies and infections to inflammation, gynaecological and obstetric conditions, and inherited red blood cell disorders. It is therefore essential to accurately measure haemoglobin and understand its underlying causes, as emphasized in &lt;a target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789240074033/%22&quot;&gt;Accelerating anaemia reduction: a comprehensive framework for action&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on this framework, WHO has released new guidelines and innovative tools to enhance the measurement, interpretation and reporting of haemoglobin concentrations. This includes the &lt;a target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789240088542/%22&quot;&gt;WHO guideline on haemoglobin cutoffs&lt;/a&gt;, which provides crucial updates on how haemoglobin levels should be measured and adjusted according to factors like elevation of residence and smoking habits. It also sets thresholds for defining anaemia and its severity across different age, sex and physiological groups. Additionally, the guideline highlights the importance of using haemoglobin levels to assess the impact of iron interventions aimed at preventing and treating iron deficiency anaemia, and to determine the public health significance of anaemia prevalence in populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recently developed &lt;a target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/tools/micronutrient-survey-analyser-and-other-tools/%22&quot;&gt;Micronutrient Survey Analyser&lt;/a&gt; web tool aids the adoption of these updated thresholds. This tool offers standard analyses and templates for reporting haemoglobin concentrations, along with data quality checks to help interpret the results accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\&quot;Using appropriate methods to measure, analyse and interpret haemoglobin concentrations is crucial to address and treat anaemia, ensuring that no individual is left behind in the pursuit of better health,\&quot; said Dr Luz Maria de Regil, Director of the WHO Department of Nutrition and Food Safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing anaemia prevalence among women aged 15–49 years is one of the World Health Assembly &lt;a target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/teams/nutrition-and-food-safety/global-targets-2025/%22&quot;&gt;Global Nutrition Targets for 2025&lt;/a&gt;. Despite some progress, we are not currently on-track to achieve this target. This has prompted WHO to propose extending the target to 2030 in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of ending all forms of malnutrition by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With anaemia remaining a significant public health challenge in many countries, WHO&#39;s updated guidelines and tools aim to support the accurate assessment of anaemia and its underlying causes, ensuring that appropriate interventions are delivered where and when they are needed most.&lt;/p&gt;We are encouraged that countries, donors and civil society are mobilizing new commitments for nutrition as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://nutritionforgrowth.org/2025-summit//%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Nutrition for Growth (N4G) Summit&lt;/a&gt; taking place in Paris, 27–28 March 2025.

Currently, these medicines are being delivered to Mongolia and Uzbekistan, with next shipments planned for Ecuador, Jordan, Nepal and Zambia. The treatments are expected to reach approximately 5000 children with cancer across at least 30 hospitals in these countries within this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global Platform is a first initiative of its kind. Countries in the pilot phase will receive an uninterrupted supply of quality-assured childhood cancer medicines at no cost. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), childhood cancer survival rates are often below 30%, significantly lower than those in high-income countries. Six additional countries have been formally invited to join the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initiative is poised to become the largest, with the goal of reaching 50 nations in the next 5 to 7 years. It aims to eventually provide medicines for the treatment of approximately 120 000 children with cancer in LMICs, significantly reducing mortality rates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For too long, children with cancer have lacked access to life-saving medicines,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This unique partnership between WHO and St. Jude is working to provide quality-assured cancer medicines to paediatric hospitals in low-and middle-income countries. WHO is proud to be part of this joint initiative with St. Jude, bringing health and hope to children around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, an estimated 400 000 children worldwide develop cancer. The majority of these children, living in resource-limited settings, are unable to consistently obtain or afford cancer medicines. It is estimated that 70% of the children from these settings die from cancer due to factors such as lack of appropriate treatment, treatment disruptions or low-quality medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A child’s chances of surviving cancer are largely determined by where they are born, making this one of the starkest disparities in global healthcare,” said James R. Downing, MD, president and CEO of St. Jude. “St. Jude was founded on Danny Thomas’ dream that no child should die in the dawn of life. By developing this platform, we believe this dream can someday be achieved for children stricken by cancer, irrespective of where they live.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Jude and WHO announced the platform in 2021 to ensure children around the world have access to lifesaving treatments. The platform brings together governments, the pharmaceutical industry and non-governmental organizations in a unique collaborative model focused on creating solutions for children with cancer. The co-design approach addresses the broader needs of national stakeholders, with a focus on capacity building and long-term sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform provides comprehensive end-to-end support, from consolidating global demand to shaping the market, assisting countries with medicine selection and developing treatment standards. It represents a transformative model for the broader global health community working together to tackle health challenges, in particular for children and noncommunicable diseases. To accomplish this, St. Jude and WHO partner with UNICEF Supply Division, and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Strategic Fund.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Notes to editors:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dedicated to the well-being of all people and guided by science, the World Health Organization (WHO) leads and champions global efforts to give everyone, everywhere an equal chance at a safe and healthy life. WHO is the UN agency for health that connects nations, partners and people on the front lines in 150+ locations – leading the world’s response to health emergencies, preventing disease, addressing the root causes of health issues and expanding access to medicines and health care. WHO’s mission is to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On childhood cancer, WHO works with over 100 global partners through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/global-initiative-for-childhood-cancer/%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer&lt;/a&gt;, to support governments in developing high-quality cancer centres and regional satellites that ensure early, accurate diagnosis and effective treatments for children with cancer. WHO also develops standards and tools to guide the planning and implementation of interventions for diagnosis, treatment and palliative and survivorship care. Progress on childhood cancer, as well as on other noncommunicable diseases, are part of the agenda for the UN General Assembly Fourth&amp;nbsp;High-Level Meeting of the on noncommunicable diseases to take place in September 2025.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is leading the way the world understands, treats and cures childhood cancer, sickle cell disease and other life-threatening disorders. It is a non-profit organization based in Memphis, Tennessee, USA, and the only National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center devoted solely to children. Treatments developed at St. Jude have helped push the overall childhood cancer survival rate from 20% to 80% since the hospital opened more than 60 years ago. St. Jude shares the breakthroughs it makes to help doctors and researchers at local hospitals and cancer centers around the world improve the quality of treatment and care for even more children. To learn more, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.stjude.org//%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;stjude.org,&lt;/a&gt; read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://blogs.stjude.org/progress.html/%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Progress: A Digital Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and follow St. Jude on social media at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://twitter.com/stjuderesearch/%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;@stjuderesearch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO and St. Jude first collaborated in 2018, when St. Jude became the first WHO Collaborating Centre for Childhood Cancer and committed US$15 million for the creation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.stjude.org/global/collaborating-to-cure/global-initiative.html/%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer&lt;/a&gt; (Global Initiative).

The initiative also complements other global health strategies aimed at addressing neurological disorders, sepsis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and HIV. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Member States called for increased support from WHO to enhance the implementation of the road map’s pillars including the introduction of comprehensive immunization programmes with affordable vaccines including&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/feature-stories/detail/a-new-vaccine-will-change-the-balance-of-the-fight-against-meningitis/%22&quot;&gt;Men5CV&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate seasonal outbreaks and protect vulnerable populations including those displaced by conflicts and environmental disasters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Member States also called for training, support and innovations in the early detection, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of people affected by meningitis. In addition, they called for strengthened communication and advocacy efforts to raise awareness among both communities and health care workers. Member States also expressed the need for adequate funding and resources, particularly in low-resource settings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collaborative efforts of partners coordinated by the Defeating Meningitis 2030 Technical Taskforce, were strongly appreciated. The importance of the taskforce in facilitating regional information exchange was highlighted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their statements, WHO Assistant Directors-General emphasized the significance of this initiative and how it benefits from a cross-departmental approach to prevent and control the disease and provide care to those affected, while highlighting the notable successes of 2024, particularly the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2024/04/26/default-calendar/the-first-high-level-meeting-to-defeat-meningitis---institut-pasteur-paris--france/%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;first high-level meeting on defeating meningitis&lt;/a&gt; in raising the awareness of the disease, and the pre-qualification of Men5CV and its implementation which will be critical for ending outbreaks within the meningitis belt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The progress report on the Global road map for defeating meningitis by 2030 will now be discussed by all Member States at the seventy-eighth World Health Assembly in May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;----&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://confirmsubscription.com/h/d/4BC833B1BCA2AAC0/%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe to the Global Immunization Newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid=&quot;\&amp;quot;2076995910\&amp;quot;&quot; paraeid=&quot;\&amp;quot;{b8478662-e542-4234-9619-cf81406a2667}{184}\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//11-02-2025-who-s-executive-board-reviews-progress-on-defeating-meningitis-by-2030</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//11-02-2025-who-s-executive-board-reviews-progress-on-defeating-meningitis-by-2030</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 14:29:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>WHO and Anesvad Foundation to extend collaboration on skin NTDs in sub-Saharan Africa</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://www.anesvad.org/en//%22&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Anesvad Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Bilbao, Spain) have signed a 2-year agreement valued at €1.4 million to support activities on skin-related NTDs (skin NTDs) in a number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

Other countries in the WHO African Region will benefit from the technical and logistical support to strengthen their work on skin NTDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It remains to be seen what the effect of recent political developments will be, but it looks like private actors will have to step up their contribution to global health. A sudden stop in mass drug administration or case-management programmes could have catastrophic consequences for NTDs all around the world. We won’t allow the good work of recent years go to waste”, &lt;/em&gt;said Iñigo Lasa, Chief Executive Officer, Anesvad Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO and Anesvad Foundation collaboration started in 2001. Initially focused on Buruli ulcer only, since 2016 the collaboration has extended to cover a larger number of skin NTDs. Today, the Anesvad Foundation is the first organization to support large-scale implementation of the WHO-recommended integrated approach for control and management of skin NTDs. It also supports WHO’s skin NTD global coordination activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;WHO is grateful for its 24 years of partnership with the Anesvad Foundation to address neglected tropical diseases that cause immense suffering to the poor”,&lt;/em&gt; said Dr Ibrahima Socé Fall, Director, WHO Global Neglected Tropical Diseases Programme&lt;em&gt;. “This renewed agreement comes at a critical time as we conduct the road map mid-term review (2021−2025) and develop an accelerated implementation plan (2026−2030).&lt;/em&gt;” &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anesvad Foundation is a Non-State Actor in official relations with WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;\&amp;quot;_com_6\&amp;quot;&quot; language=&quot;\&amp;quot;JavaScript\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//10-02-2025-who-and-anesvad-foundation-to-extend-collaboration-on-skin-ntds-in-sub-saharan-africa</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//10-02-2025-who-and-anesvad-foundation-to-extend-collaboration-on-skin-ntds-in-sub-saharan-africa</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 10:38:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>WHO updates guidelines on opioid dependence treatment and overdose prevention</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO announces development of updated guidelines for the psychosocially assisted pharmacological treatment of opioid dependence and community management of opioid overdose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, approximately 60 million people globally engaged in non-medical opioid use, including the use of drugs like heroin, morphine, codeine, fentanyl, methadone, tramadol, and other similar substances. Their regular non-medical use, prolonged use, use by injection, misuse and use without medical supervision can lead to opioid dependence and other health problems, and associated with significant health burden. Out of 600,000 deaths attributed to drug use, about 450 000 are due to use of opioids according to the latest WHO estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is crucial that people with opioid dependence and those at risk of opioid overdose have access to prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and care, which are of good quality, affordable, ethical and evidence based. While some 64 million people globally are estimated to live with drug use disorders, access to treatment remains very limited, with less than 10% having access to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address the issue, WHO has published guidelines for the psychosocially assisted pharmacological treatment of opioid dependence (2009) and community management of opioid overdose (2014).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the guidelines, WHO recommends the use of a range of treatment options for opioid dependence. These include opioid agonist maintenance treatment (or OAMT) with medicines such as methadone and buprenorphine, pharmacological treatment with opioid antagonists (such as naltrexone) as well as psychosocial support. In the choice of treatment, WHO recommends OAMT to be used for most patients as the intervention with strongest evidence of effectiveness for variety of outcomes. These include reduction in non-medical opioid use, mortality and morbidity (including due to opioid overdose, HIV and viral hepatitis), lowering risk of crime and incarceration, better retention in treatment, quality of life and overall wellbeing. In the guidelines on community management of opioid overdose, WHO recommends that people who are likely to witness an opioid overdose, including people who use opioids, and their family and friends should be given access to naloxone and training in its use so that they can respond to opioid overdose in an emergency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, WHO is convening a guideline development group (GDG) for update of both guidelines with an aim to improve availability and access to treatment of opioid dependence and reduce the number of deaths from opioid overdose by providing evidence-based recommendations on the psychosocially assisted pharmacological treatment and interventions on prevention and management of opioid overdose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A GDG meeting will be held in Geneva in October 2025. Evidence, including systematic reviews, about treatment of opioid dependence and management of opioid overdose will be presented to the GDG. GDG members will contribute to the review of systematic reviews, evidence summaries, technical updates, and will propose recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guideline development group composition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In accordance with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/%22https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/145714/%22&quot; target=&quot;\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;&quot; data-sf-ec-immutable=&quot;\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;WHO guidelines for developing recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, the steering group for the guidelines development includes members from multiple WHO teams in Headquarter and Regional Offices, including departments directly working in the area of drug policy, such as the Departments of Mental Health, Brain Health and Substance Use (UCN/MSD), Access to Medicines and Health Products (MHP/HPS), and Global HIV, Hepatitis and STIs programmes (UCN/HHS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guideline Development Group (GDG) is composed of members from all WHO regions, serving in their individual capacities rather than as representatives of affiliated organizations. GDG members were selected by WHO technical staff based on their technical expertise, their role as end-users (e.g., programme managers and healthcare providers), and their representation of affected communities. Members do not receive financial compensation for their contributions to this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for public comments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure transparency and inclusivity, WHO invites members of the public and interested organizations to review the biographies of the GDG members and provide feedback.
