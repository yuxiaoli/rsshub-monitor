&lt;p&gt;A sprig of moss is growing on a tree in the Duwamish Valley, the most polluted area in Seattle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While that moss might seem ordinary, it has a secret superpower: It’s keeping a record of the pollution in the air — from the trucks, trains, planes, cargo ships, and hundreds of industrial facilities that surround it. Now, a group of community scientists are using this overlooked plant to take control of the air they breathe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moss is a type of plant. But it’s not like most plants. Mosses evolved hundreds of millions of years ago, long before the advent of trees or flowers. And, for the most part, they’re still pretty pretty low-tech plants. They don’t have roots, or any major system to circulate water and nutrients. Instead, they get everything they need by absorbing it from the air, directly into their spongy cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When moss is absorbing nutrients, it’s also absorbing everything else that’s in the air. And by sampling moss on a tree, and testing it in the lab, you get a fingerprint of what’s in the air in that specific place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;If you’re interested in what the air quality has been like, you can go out there and collect the moss and you can get an idea of what that looks like,&lt;em&gt;” &lt;/em&gt;said Sarah Jovan, a research ecologist for the U.S. Forest Service who studies mosses and lichens — which have similar pollution-detecting superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her research started in the wilderness: using mosses and lichens to learn about air pollution in our national parks and forests. After several years, she had an idea that no one in the U.S. had ever tried on a large scale: to use moss to study air pollution in cities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the time, her home city of Portland was facing a common problem: They only had one main air monitor for the whole city. That stationary monitor could tell you exact levels of pollution in the air, but it was really expensive. That meant Portland couldn’t afford enough monitors to track air pollution on a neighborhood level. Portland did, however, have a lot of moss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s moss all over the place in this city, like we could collect almost anywhere we want to,” Jovan said. “From a statistician’s point of view, we could have a really bad ass design!&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sampling moss would be cheap, too. A study with hundreds of samples across Portland would cost about as much as a study with one official stationary monitor. While the moss couldn’t tell you exactly how much pollution was in the air, it could be a perfect screening tool. It could help identify which neighborhoods have the worst air pollution, and then an official monitor could follow up to measure just how bad that air actually is.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Jovan and her team sampled moss from 346 trees around Portland and tested them for metal pollutants like lead, arsenic, and chromium. And when they put all those results on a map, they found a pollution hotspot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their moss samples revealed a residential neighborhood in Portland that had much higher levels of cadmium and arsenic than the rest of the city. An official followup confirmed the source: a local stained glass factory that used these metals to make glass colorful and clear.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You’re glad you revealed it, because now we have a chance to address and change it,” Jovan said. “But it was a little horrifying. We were pretty darn stressed out about it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fs.usda.gov/pnw/projects/portland-moss-and-air-quality-study&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; created a scandal. But the findings caught people’s attention. It led to new environmental laws and more air monitors in the city. And it also caught the attention of another community, 150 miles to the north.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Duwamish Valley has been home to Seattle’s heavy industry for more than 100 years. And in the middle of that industrial valley are two residential neighborhoods: Georgetown and South Park.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;The Duwamish Valley, it’s an environmental injustice community,&lt;em&gt;” &lt;/em&gt;said Paulina López, the executive director of the Duwamish River Cleanup Coalition. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;I moved to this neighborhood because I wanted to be for sure surrounded by people that look like me.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I’m from South America and I have always prioritized spaces that look like this neighborhood – families, river water access, and the diversity that exists within it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Residents know pollution in the valley is a problem. They face a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d744c68218c867c14aa5531/t/5e0ede36af57813870f3b630/1578032698272/Table-C2-Health-Indicators-for-10-ZIP-codes.pdf#page=5&quot;&gt;environmental health concerns&lt;/a&gt;, like asthma or heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We know who are the polluters. But we haven’t been able to prove it,” López said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To clean up the valley, they needed a much more detailed picture of all the different sources of pollution. The Cleanup Coalition saw moss as a way to do that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Portland moss study proved that scientists could use a simple plant to reveal big truths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Seattle, they wanted to take it a step further. They wanted to see if the community could do it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I see the moss study like, oh, actually, we took matters into our own hands,” said Adrienne Hampton, Climate Policy and Engagement Manager for the Cleanup Coalition. “This is what we learned. Take it or leave it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jovan — along with partners from other agencies, universities, and nonprofits — helped train a group of local youth scientists, who then went around south Seattle finding trees and collecting the moss.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When they got the pollution results back from the lab and put their findings on a map, they found what looked like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d744c68218c867c14aa5531/t/5ed16de4123e6107720b90e9/1590783465550/Moss+study+Press+release+FINAL.pdf&quot;&gt;hotspot&lt;/a&gt;. A cluster of samples with high levels of pollutants like arsenic and chromium.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was very surprising,” López said. “Surprising, but also not surprising.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike Portland, South Seattle residents were more validated than shocked. Everyone in the valley knew it was polluted, but the moss provided block-by-block proof.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of the moss study, the regional air agency is starting an &lt;a href=&quot;https://pscleanair.gov/634/2021-2022-Air-Toxics-Study&quot;&gt;official followup&lt;/a&gt; on metals in the valley, guided by the community. That followup will show exactly how much of a risk these metals pose to the community, and could be the kind of hard evidence that could lead to real reforms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of people out there, across the country, who have contacted me and want to do their own studies,” Jovan said. “And they all have great reasons why they’d want to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations. Like how too much pollution can kill moss and lichen, which makes this study tricky in some cities. Still, Jovan thinks a lot of cities could find some way to make it work. And that could translate to more people breathing cleaner air.&lt;/p&gt;

The upper Midwest could soon be the most sought-after living destination in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The curb appeal of the Great Lakes region is that it appears to be a relatively safe place to ride out the wild weather of the future. It’s far from the storm-battered Eastern seaboard and buffered from the West’s wildfires and drought, with some of the largest sources of fresh water in the world. The Great Lakes help temper the bitter winds of winter and cool the muggy summer. And rising temperatures are beginning to take some of the bite off that winter weather: Michigan, in fact, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://grist.org/climate/cheers-rising-temperatures-could-make-michigan-the-next-great-wine-hub/&quot;&gt;turning into wine country&lt;/a&gt;, with vineyards growing warm-weather grapes like pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Long-simmering speculations about where to hide from climate change picked up in February 2019 when the mayor of Buffalo, New York, declared that the city on Lake Erie’s eastern edge would one day become a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;amp;v=988634991331237&quot;&gt;climate refuge&lt;/a&gt;.” Two months later, a New York Times article made the case that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/climate/climate-migration-duluth.html&quot;&gt;Duluth, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, on the western corner of Lake Superior, could be an attractive new home for Texans and Floridians looking to escape blistering temperatures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In this century, climate migration will be larger, and is already by some measures larger, than political or economic migration,” Parag Khanna, a global strategy advisor, told me over the phone. His recent book, &lt;em&gt;Move: The Forces Uprooting Us&lt;/em&gt;, analyzes where people are relocating to and how the “map of humanity” will shift in the coming decades, with an eye toward climate change, politics, jobs, and technology. Khanna is particularly bullish on Michigan. When I mentioned I grew up in northern Indiana a couple of miles south of the Michigan border, he said, “Go back and buy property now. At least, that’s the way some people are interpreting it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a big market for mapping out where people will live in a hotter climate, with the consensus landing mostly on northern latitudes buffered from rising seas, heat, and drought. These forecasts are already shaping reality, with Great Lakes cities planning for an influx of residents and rich preppers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/15/business/bunkers-new-zealand-intl-hnk/index.html&quot;&gt;buying bunkers in New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; to ride out the apocalypse. Vivek Shandas, who studies climate change and cities at Portland State University, says he regularly gets calls from real estate investors asking where to buy up property.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/temperature-suitability-change-colored-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A map of the world shows parts of South America, Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and the southern U.S. in red, and nothern latitudes in shades of green.&quot; data-caption=&quot;The optimal geographies for human habitation are shifting as temperatures rise.

&lt;p&gt;More Americans are moving for jobs and affordable housing than because of climate change, Khanna says. But migration from wildfires, hurricanes, and drought is already well underway. “The global answer is, it’s already happening, right?” Khanna said. “In America, you’re only seeing early signs of it.” Around 25,000 migrants fleeing Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria in 2017 settled in Orlando, Florida, and as many as 5,000 &lt;a href=&quot;https://buffalonews.com/news/local/hurricane-refugees-liked-what-they-found-in-buffalo-so-theyre-staying/article_c69708c3-fc0a-583f-a8ce-c8f2060c514d.html&quot;&gt;moved&lt;/a&gt; to the proclaimed “climate haven” of Buffalo. Many of the thousands of evacuees from the 2018 Camp Fire that destroyed Paradise, California, relocated to the nearby town of Chico.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recent headlines have predicted that the state of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2021/11/michigan-will-be-the-best-place-to-live-by-2050-because-of-climate-change-new-book-says.html&quot;&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; will be “the best place to live by 2050” and that cities in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.syracuse.com/weather/2021/02/upstate-ny-cities-among-best-climate-havens-as-the-world-grow-hotter.html&quot;&gt;upstate New York&lt;/a&gt; will be among the “the best ‘climate havens’” in the world. In October, a local paper in Minnesota declared that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/10/04/climateproof-duluth-why-the-city-is-attracting-climate-migrants&quot;&gt;climate-proof Duluth&lt;/a&gt;” was already attracting migrants from the smoke-filled, wildfire-ridden West.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With as many as 143 million people worldwide expected to be on the move because of climate change by 2050, would-be havens are sure to face new challenges — gentrification, housing shortages, and issues scaling up services quickly. But advance planning can alleviate the stress on cities as well as on their newcomers. With expert advice, these climate havens can learn how to become a fair and welcoming refuge for everyone, as opposed to a hostile citadel surrounded by, say, a giant wall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot; id=&quot;h-step-1-figure-out-what-a-climate-haven-really-is&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Figure out what a ‘climate haven’ really is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is no escape from the effects of an overheating planet, even in a so-called haven. The Great Lakes region is witnessing heavy flooding: 11,000 people in central Michigan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/flooding-hits-parts-midwest-evacuations-michigan-n1210536&quot;&gt;evacuated&lt;/a&gt; last year as severe rains overwhelmed dams. This summer, wildfire smoke from Canada blew into Minnesota, bringing &lt;a href=&quot;https://grist.org/wildfires/wildfire-smoke-in-minnesota-brings-dystopian-skies-to-the-midwest/&quot;&gt;an unprecedented haze&lt;/a&gt; and making it hazardous to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So defining what makes a city a “refuge” isn’t simple. &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13412-021-00712-2&quot;&gt;A recent study&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at MIT and the National League of Cities attempted to lay out the qualities of “climate destinations” like Duluth, Buffalo, and Cincinnati, Ohio. First, the effects of climate change should be considered “more manageable” than other places — in other words, not subject to monster hurricanes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://grist.org/wildfires/outpaced-wildfire-control-projects-are-burning-up-before-they-can-even-start/&quot;&gt;fast-moving wildfires&lt;/a&gt;, and the relentless rise of the sea. Havens should also have ample fresh water, lots of affordable housing, and infrastructure to support several thousand new residents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The final qualifications are a bit squishier: These cities must express a “desire to grow and be welcoming” and work on becoming sustainable and resilient. The study points to Duluth investing $200 million over recent years into improving its shoreline protections and wastewater system, and Cincinnati’s plans to cut carbon emissions and host climate migrants (prompted in part by a wave of former New Orleans residents that moved to the city after Hurricane Katrina in 2005).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/michigan-flood-dam-break.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A streetview of a small town is submerged in brown water.&quot; data-caption=&quot;A flooded street in Sanford, Michigan after a dam was breached on May 20, 2020.

&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Rajkovich, a professor studying resilience and urban planning at the University at Buffalo, says he wants more concrete action behind Buffalo’s “climate haven” promises. “In some cases, it’s become more of an economic development slogan than the real detailed and robust planning that is going to be necessary to actually make these places a haven from climate change,” Rajkovich said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Put people first&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cities that want to attract climate migrants emphasize the opportunities that come with people moving in, like economic growth and attracting new, skilled workers. But it’s important to remember that “migrants are not a tool to an end” and that they get the support they need, said Susan Ekoh, an adaptation fellow at the America Society of Adaptation Professionals, an organization preparing towns in the Great Lakes for the expected waves of future inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some residents in self-declared climate havens don’t want the title. Ekoh has had conversations with business groups, environmental justice organizations, local and state officials, and representatives from tribes around the region. She often hears worries about gentrification, that their towns will attract wealthy people, drive up housing prices, and push out poorer residents. Another critique is that climate “refuges” are failing to protect the people that already live there. For all the talk of Michigan being surrounded by ample freshwater, it’s also known for lead-poisoned water in cities like &lt;a href=&quot;https://grist.org/health/how-are-michigan-residents-still-drinking-water-with-toxic-levels-of-lead-years-after-flint/&quot;&gt;Benton Harbor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shandas, the professor at Portland State, said cities should implement housing policies that can guard against gentrification and also prepare for a backlash. Idaho, for instance, has seen an influx of California expats escaping fires and drought and looking for someplace more affordable. One researcher told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/11/27/how-climate-migrants-are-roiling-american-politics-523295?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=188838347&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ImEbwsoIqTQuBlx3-PNP3m_hYrUo1dSS7sh3JxeKzu8O3J76dbGMVSNxDR-qsEvKuYzvk4v3sW6GxzuGR6mgAiaHDkA&amp;amp;utm_content=188838347&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt; that some locals, conservatives and liberals alike, resent the newcomers, painting things like “California sucks” on highway overpasses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s the kind of stuff I worry about,” Shandas said. “We can build the schools, we can build the housing, but is that local community ready for big shifts of people moving into the location, and potentially people who are very different from them?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Orlando-Puerto-Ricans-Hurricane-Maria.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;People wait at an information center.&quot; data-caption=&quot;A reception center for Puerto Rican refugees at the Orlando International Airport on November 30, 2017, after Hurricane Maria. &quot; data-credit=&quot;RICARDO ARDUENGO / AFP via Getty Images&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A reception center for Puerto Rican refugees at the Orlando International Airport on November 30, 2017, after Hurricane Maria.  &lt;cite&gt;RICARDO ARDUENGO / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Build smart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step is to make the city an appealing place to live while trimming emissions, using resources wisely, and keeping the dangers of climate change at bay.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to cut a city’s carbon output, like building dense housing, improving public transit, and cleaning up the electric grid. “You’d want to build in such a way where you have a lot of access to renewable and decentralized power,” Shandas said. But what you &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; build is also important. Constructing a new “green” building still leads to &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/we-cant-afford-to-just-build-greener-we-must-build-less-170570&quot;&gt;a lot of carbon emissions&lt;/a&gt;; retrofitting existing buildings is often cheaper and less wasteful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Midwest is already prone to flooding, and climate change is expected to make it worse. So building in floodplains is not ideal, nor is covering everything in impermeable pavement. Cities should also find ways to beat the heat — parks keep things cool, while highways make it hot. Nothing here should come as a surprise to city planners. “I mean, it’s not rocket science,” Shandas said. “We’ve been doing this for a while.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shandas said he’s heard people in Midwest cities get pretty excited about their future. “I was in a couple of meetings with a group of folks in the Great Lakes, and they were just like, ‘We are the climate haven — we are going to be the best place in the country and people are gonna flock to us,’” he said. While that kind of enthusiasm is “fantastic,” Shandas said, if cities don’t start preparing for the actual reality of thousands of people moving in, “it’s going to be a hard sell.”&lt;/p&gt;

Now Michigan wants to tear it down.</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is published in collaboration with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bridgedetroit.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;BridgeDetroit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;In 1945 in Detroit, Michigan, a man who is believed to be the first African-American independent record producer opened up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://marshamusic.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;blues and gospel record store&lt;/a&gt; called Joe’s Record Shop. The store was lined with vinyl records and music posters, with a big, upright piano in the back. Joe Von Battle &lt;a href=&quot;https://marshamusic.wordpress.com/page-joe-von-battle-requiem-for-a-record-shop-man/&quot;&gt;started the business by selling records from his personal collection&lt;/a&gt;. Later, he remodeled the store to include a recording studio. His shop was a focal point for the music scene on Hastings Street — &lt;a href=&quot;https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/black-bottom-neighborhood&quot;&gt;the center of Black business and entertainment in 1950s Detroit&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People sang up and down the street, they played their guitars on the corner, they sang gospel,” said Von Battle’s daughter, 67-year-old Marsha Philpot, more commonly known as writer Marsha Music, “so my dad began to record these people.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Von Battle recorded blues artists like John Lee Hooker and was &lt;a href=&quot;https://michiganchronicle.com/2017/02/08/joe-von-battle-one-of-detroits-great-music-business-heroes/&quot;&gt;the first person to ever record Aretha Franklin&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, Joe’s Record Shop had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20170617/news03/631696/hastings-street-blues-economic-roots-contributed-detroits-worst&quot;&gt;35,000 albums in its inventory&lt;/a&gt; and generated the present-day equivalent of $2.5 million in revenue. “My father had been very, very successful in his record business,” Music said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in 1960, Von Battle &lt;a href=&quot;https://michiganchronicle.com/2017/02/08/joe-von-battle-one-of-detroits-great-music-business-heroes/&quot;&gt;was forced to close his shop&lt;/a&gt; and relocate to make way for I-375 — a giant, four-lane sunken freeway. Over a mile of Hastings Street and its surrounding land was turned over to developers, dismantling the once thriving epicenter of Black life in Detroit in order to create a high-speed thoroughfare from downtown to the surrounding suburbs. Hastings Street was home to more than 300 Black-owned businesses, including restaurants, doctors’ offices, and even eight grocery stores. Hundreds were forced to relocate or close permanently. Today, there isn’t a single Black-owned grocery store in Detroit, the Blackest big city in America.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After his building was demolished, Von Battle &lt;a href=&quot;https://marshamusic.wordpress.com/page-joe-von-battle-requiem-for-a-record-shop-man/&quot;&gt;moved his record shop&lt;/a&gt; from the east side of Detroit to the west side, on 12th Street. The business struggled. Von Battle battled alcoholism and was soon diagnosed with Addison’s disease. Eventually, he permanently closed the shop after it was destroyed in Detroit’s 1967 race riots. Music and her siblings believe the shop’s forced displacement from Hastings Street was likely the catalyst for their father’s alcoholism. “He was very despondent,” Music told Grist, describing on &lt;a href=&quot;https://marshamusic.wordpress.com/page-joe-von-battle-requiem-for-a-record-shop-man/&quot;&gt;her website&lt;/a&gt; that he “drank himself to death.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In June 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Federal Interstate Highway Act into law, spurring a multi-decade national infrastructure building boom. In cities across the U.S., these new roadways were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/08/16/interstate-highways-were-touted-modern-marvels-racial-injustice-was-part-plan/&quot;&gt;disproportionately routed&lt;/a&gt; through communities of color. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/07/28/advocates-rally-to-tear-down-highways-that-bulldozed-black-neighborhoods&quot;&gt;Detroit to New Orleans to Miami&lt;/a&gt;, this construction helped contribute to the decimation of the culture, political power, and economies of Black America amidst the peak of the Civil Rights movement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Throughout the country, urban freeways were routed through Black neighborhoods, resulting in the malicious division and forced displacement of Black neighborhoods, as well as local Black economies,” said Regan Patterson, an environmental engineer and current &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbcfinc.org/policy-research/policy-experts/&quot;&gt;fellow at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this infrastructure is hitting the end of its lifespan, and communities are now debating what to do with their legacy highways. In Charleston, South Carolina, officials decided to double down, spending $3 billion to widen a freeway through predominantly Black and brown neighborhoods. Others, however, are questioning whether to remove them altogether, righting some of the wrongs done when communities were bifurcated so many years ago.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detroit has chosen the latter. Rather than rebuild or repair I-375’s aging bridges, the Michigan Department of Transportation, or MDOT, announced in 2017 that it would replace the sunken, four-lane highway with a street-level boulevard lined with sidewalks and bike lanes. The initiative, called the I-375 Improvement Project, would reconnect the local neighborhoods along where Hastings Street once stood, as well as create a thoroughfare from Detroit’s downtown to two of its biggest cultural hubs: the RiverWalk area and Eastern Market, &lt;a href=&quot;https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/eastern-market-historic-district&quot;&gt;the largest historic public market&lt;/a&gt; in the country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Detroit joins the ranks of cities including San Francisco, Seattle, Milwaukee, and Boston in choosing to remove problematic roadways. Even more cities could soon follow suit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Congress passed the long-awaited bipartisan &lt;a href=&quot;https://grist.org/politics/the-house-just-passed-a-major-infrastructure-bill-heres-whats-in-it/&quot;&gt;infrastructure bill&lt;/a&gt;. It includes $1 billion slotted for removing roads, bridges, and highways that cut through communities of color like Hastings Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;Detroit’s Monroe Street bridge provides a good look at I-375 in both directions. Here, the freeway spans 350 feet wide, with grassy banks on either side sloping down to the sunken concrete roadway. A barrier separates the north and southbound lanes. Monroe Street is one of 14 vehicular bridges that stretch across the 1-mile length of I-375, all of which will be taken out when the highway is removed, explained Jonathan Loree, a senior project manager for MDOT. He is standing on the bridge, looking through a chain-link fence onto the highway below. It is a warm early summer morning.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, the area around I-375 contains almost no trace of its historic roots. The highway is surrounded by parking garages, churches, and office buildings. Cracked sidewalks line nearby streets, but go largely unused. A juvenile detention facility and a casino sit just one block away. There are a few small apartment buildings, but otherwise no residential amenities like restaurants or stores.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The I-375 Improvement Project is expected to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2021/01/27/detroit-highway-replaced-black-bottom/4260800001/&quot;&gt;cost&lt;/a&gt; around $270 million. Officials have a target start date of 2027, but they say it will likely get underway even sooner. Federal funds are expected to cover 80 percent of the project’s budget, with the state contributing the other 20 percent. Detroit itself will pay for the construction of city streets that need to be rebuilt to fit into the new at-grade boulevard’s design. So far, the Michigan Department of Transportation has submitted a preferred design for the boulevard and a draft environmental assessment, as well as held a public hearing for community input. Transit officials expect final approval of the project from the Federal Highway Administration in December.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new road will be six lanes and transition to four in the last portion of the boulevard, closest to the river. It will be lined by protected bike lanes and more sidewalks, measuring 22 feet across, that will double as gathering spaces. It will also open up about 12 acres of land to be used for housing, retail, or green space — details that will be determined in the next phase of the project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, the expressway interchange fractured Detroit’s walking and bike routes, making it almost impossible to travel safely in that part of the city without a motorized vehicle, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/luckyfish/&quot;&gt;Todd Scott&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the Detroit Greenways Coalition, told Grist.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It just changes everything,” he said. “It really connects the downtown to the surrounding area. If it’s filled with local businesses and multi-use, maybe it could make a lot more walkable destinations for folks who live nearby.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bonnie Leone has been a member of Holy Family Church, which sits just off of I-375, for more than two decades. She’s attended several community meetings for the project in the last few years. “We see it as kind of putting the neighborhood back together,” she said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Loree and community advocates say there’s also potential to incorporate stormwater infrastructure in the boulevard’s design, something that Detroit desperately needs. The city’s many sunken highways are susceptible to &lt;a href=&quot;https://grist.org/cities/how-many-500-year-floods-must-detroit-endure-in-a-decade/&quot;&gt;flash flooding&lt;/a&gt;, which can leave people stranded in their cars. Currently, water from I-375 goes into the city’s combined sewer system, which is easily overwhelmed during intense rainfall. When the system is overloaded, homes flood and raw sewage is released into waterways. The newly designed boulevard, and its more direct connection to the riverfront, could help manage excess water both today and under future climate scenarios, Loree said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the I-375 Improvement Project will have a lot of benefits, can it ever recover what was lost by the highway’s creation in the 1960s? And how can it protect current residents against gentrification?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Hastings Street ran north-south through Detroit’s Black Bottom neighborhood and Black entertainment and business district, known as Paradise Valley. The destruction of the epicenters of Detroit’s Black life started with the condemnation of housing through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/LEGS_CHRON_JUNE2014.PDF&quot;&gt;National Housing Act of 1949&lt;/a&gt;, which gave money to cities for “slum clearance and urban revitalization.” (Public policy had long restricted Black people to living in the worst, cramped housing in the city.) It continued when the city received even more funds through the National Highway Act in 1956.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Highways increased air pollution, increased noise pollution, and forced displacement,” said Patterson.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s unknown just how much intergenerational wealth was lost from the construction of I-375 in Detroit. What would have happened if Joe’s Record Shop or the hundreds of other businesses that lined Hastings Street had been left alone? Where would those families be now? Comparison to a similar event in another city may offer a clue.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Minnesota, a highway was built in the 1950s and 60s through Rondo, a thriving African-American cultural center in St. Paul, displacing 700 homes and 300 businesses. The neighborhood’s population decreased by 61 percent, and homeownership declined by 48 percent. Had Rondo followed the home value trends of St. Paul more broadly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51hGZtOBaio&amp;amp;t=5183s&quot;&gt;an additional $270 million of intergenerational wealth&lt;/a&gt; would have existed for Black families today, according to an analysis by Yorth Group, an infrastructure advisory firm for the community nonprofit ReConnect Rondo. And that’s likely an underestimate, as the analysis focused only on the homes lost by the project, not the 300 businesses also destroyed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Keith Baker, a transportation equity expert and executive director of ReConnect Rondo, says the significance extends to what that money could have been used for in the 1980s had those houses been sold or accumulated value. “Home equity was often used to provide educational opportunities for children,” he said. “We all understand the economic benefit of higher education or training and what it means to the health and well being of a community.” At that point in history, Baker estimates 3,400 college degrees could have been paid for with the housing profit that was lost when the homes were destroyed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s something that no one ever quantifies when you think about what’s lost,” said Lauren Hood, chair of the Detroit Planning Commission, an advisory committee that gives recommendations to the City Council on development in the city. Hood is a Detroit reparations fellow through the University of Michigan, a role in which she’s looking at exactly what was lost from the destruction of the Hastings Street neighborhoods of Black Bottom and Paradise Valley, and what reparations for that harm should look like. It’s not just about money, she said. “We lost our community connections, our political power, so much more than just the intergenerational wealth, businesses, and homes.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;So how does this all get done? How do you tear down a highway and restore the fabric of a community? First and foremost, experts say, community participation from the beginning is key. After that, there are a number of strategies that experts say can and should be utilized to minimize harm and maximize repair.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When highways are removed and replaced, more green space, cleaner air, and decreased noise can make the space highly desirable to developers, which can displace current residents. There are different ways to prevent that from happening, though, if a city is serious about addressing the economic, cultural, and public health harm caused by the highway.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You need comprehensive and intersectional policy solutions,” said Patterson. “They must be coupled with anti-displacement strategies to ensure that the communities that are meant to benefit [from] freeway removal initiatives actually are able to remain in the area to see these benefits.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Roach, director of media relations for the city of Detroit, told Grist that because the I-375 removal hasn’t been granted final approval, the city hasn’t had these discussions yet, but that it always aims to bolster affordable housing with new development.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some Detroit residents, however, are skeptical. Music, a lifelong Detroiter, has had mixed feelings about the planning process for I-375 so far: “I always had the feeling that they were going through this dog and pony show, when they know what they’re gonna do anyway.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bert Dearing Jr., owner of Bert’s Market Place in the Eastern Market neighborhood, grew up just a few blocks from Hastings St. As a paperboy, his route crossed the historic thoroughfare each day. And he recalls visiting Hastings St. for most things: the movies, the barbershop, bookstores, and his grandfather’s grocery store on the corner. When they put I-375 in, “it just took the wind out of everything,” he said. Dearing told Grist he’s not convinced the highway removal will ever happen — he’s watched project after project in Detroit lose funding or never get completed. And he definitely doesn’t think the project will bring back the spirit of Hastings St. “That ain’t going to happen,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Others have critiqued the new boulevard’s physical design. The current proposal for the six-lane road to replace I-375 will encourage speeding and a higher volume of traffic — basically replicating the effects of a highway, argues &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnu.org/publicsquare/author/ben-crowther&quot;&gt;Ben Crowther&lt;/a&gt;, manager of the Highways to Boulevards program at the nonprofit Congress for the New Urbanism. “You don’t reap the full benefits of removal if you just build another wide road,” he told Grist. A common misconception, he added, is that highway replacements must be able to accommodate the same volume of traffic, but that isn’t true: People take alternative routes, bike, walk, or skip the trip altogether if the original highway is no longer available.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A model example of community engagement that experts point to is in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where the city has created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://minneapolis2040.com/policies/freeway-remediation/&quot;&gt;Freeway Remediation policy&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lincolninst.edu/publications/articles/2020-03-deconstruction-ahead-urban-highway-removal-changing-cities&quot;&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; the city will “repurpose space taken by construction of the interstate highway system and use it to reconnect neighborhoods and provide needed housing, employment, green space, clean energy, and other amenities consistent with city goals.” In addition to action steps to identify and consider areas for highway removal and land bridges, the policy includes a step to consider how profit from private development could be paid to people or descendants of those whose homes were taken by eminent domain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another example is I-980, a freeway in Oakland, California, that displaced over 500 homes when it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.connectoakland.org/history/i-980/&quot;&gt;built in the 1960s&lt;/a&gt;. For years, activists have been working to get the &lt;a href=&quot;https://grist.org/cities/oakland-california-freeway-removal-interstate-980/&quot;&gt;freeway replaced&lt;/a&gt; with a boulevard. In 2019, the city &lt;a href=&quot;https://cao-94612.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/FINAL_DOSP-Public-Review-Draft-Plan_082819_Compressed.pdf&quot;&gt;proposed a plan&lt;/a&gt; to assess the long-term feasibility of replacing the freeway, including “using the revenues from public land to repair inequities caused by the creation of I-980.” Oakland anticipates &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oaklandca.gov/news/2021/downtown-oakland-specific-plan-update&quot;&gt;adopting the plan&lt;/a&gt; by the end of 2021.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cities can also work with community land banks or trusts to avoid displacement. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://community-wealth.org/strategies/panel/clts/index.html&quot;&gt;community land trust&lt;/a&gt; is a nonprofit organization that stewards land for nearby neighborhoods, in order to accomplish goals like securing affordable housing. A family enters into a long-term renewable lease instead of buying the home. Then, if they decide to “sell,” the family earns a portion of the home sale, and the rest is kept by the trust to ensure affordability for future families. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://shelterforce.org/2016/11/09/land-banks-community-land-trusts-not-synonyms-or-antonyms-complements/&quot;&gt;land bank&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, holds abandoned land for future development until the community knows what it wants to do with it and transfers ownership. Because the I-375 removal is still in the proposal phase, the city of Detroit has not planned which — if any — of these strategies it will use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These techniques have been well-tested. In Washington, D.C., the nonprofit Building Bridges Across the River is developing &lt;a href=&quot;https://grist.org/justice/green-space-cities-gentrification-11th-street-bridge-washington-anacostia/&quot;&gt;a park over an abandoned bridge&lt;/a&gt;, linking the upscale neighborhood of Capitol Hill with Anacostia, a low-income and predominantly Black community. To prevent gentrification, the nonprofit launched the Douglass Community Land Trust, which is ensuring that 200 units of housing stay affordable in perpetuity. Additionally, Building Bridges worked with MANNA, another nonprofit, to create a home-buyers club. So far, 87 renters in the area have become homeowners through the program.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-17/inclusionary-zoning-everything-you-need-to-know?sref=wINQCNXe&quot;&gt;Inclusionary zoning&lt;/a&gt; is another option. Through these programs, developers are required or incentivized to offer a certain number of units in new projects at lower prices. Developers often sign on because it can mean they’re allowed to develop larger buildings than existing zoning allows. But, the research on how effective this private affordable housing strategy is generally unclear. Inclusionary zoning typically results in just a few affordable units, leaving thousands of qualified candidates without affordable options and failing to ensure a neighborhood is integrated by race and income.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though these strategies are flawed, without them, there’s a chance highway removal can do more harm than good to communities of color, experts warn.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Baker at ReConnect Rondo said doing the intergenerational wealth analysis has been immensely helpful. “Quantifying it creates an opportunity for communities to rally around an expectation, because now they can say, ‘This was our loss.” Otherwise, he said, it’s anecdotal. “We have got to make sure that we’re speaking the language of the institutions, and that we’re translating that in a way that they fully understand the economic impact.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;After President Biden revealed his infrastructure plan earlier this year, several congressional leaders sponsored a bill &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.minnpost.com/national/2021/05/in-biden-infrastructure-plan-advocates-see-opportunity-to-revive-st-pauls-rondo-neighborhood-with-i-94-land-bridge/&quot;&gt;that would put Biden’s promises into action&lt;/a&gt;, called the Reconnecting Communities Act. The program would address the “legacy of highway construction built through communities, especially through low-income communities and communities of color, that divided neighborhoods and erected barriers to mobility and opportunity.” Originally, the proposal included $20 billion for highway removal, but that was cut to $1 billion when it was folded into the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed by Congress last month.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The program includes community engagement grants for government agencies and nonprofit organizations to work with residents to see what they want out of highway removal. And there’s proposed funding for community land trusts, Patterson says, “to ensure that the community is still empowered in terms of land decisions.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s just that recognition of process,” she said, praising the act for acknowledging that freeway removal itself isn’t a solution — it requires intentional community involvement as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MDOT is hoping to get some of the infrastructure bill money for Detroit, in which case it could bring the timeline of the I-375 removal project forward, Loree said. Once the boulevard proposal is approved by the Federal Highway Administration, I-375 would be de-designated from the Interstate System of Highways. Then, MDOT would conduct the final, permanent design phase, which includes local stakeholder feedback and engagement. Construction would begin in 2027, if not sooner. One option for the new name of the boulevard is “Hastings Street.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of the loss of her dad’s record store, Music says people always want to know what she thinks about Detroit’s highway and the removal project. “Because I understand the gravity of the destruction that took place and I understand it personally, it’s hard to be very sanguine about anything that’s going on now,” she said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An entire generation of wealth has been eliminated, people’s businesses have been altered. Now, it’s like ‘Oops, maybe we shouldn’t have done that,’” Music said. “It’s hard to feel jubilant about that, even if it is a potentially progressive move.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated to reflect Marsha Battle Philpot’s more commonly used name, Marsha Music.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It cost $270 and left me hungry.</title><description>&lt;p&gt;In the first half of the 20th century, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company built two skyscrapers just across the street from Madison Square Park in Manhattan. One of them is now home to Eleven Madison Park, widely considered one of the best restaurants in America, and the most prominent to announce its intentions to do something about climate change. The other tower, currently home to a luxury hotel, is the setting for science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson’s dystopian 2017 novel, &lt;em&gt;New York 2140&lt;/em&gt;, which takes place after catastrophic climate change has already arrived&lt;em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eleven Madison Park doesn’t exist in the world of &lt;em&gt;New York 2140&lt;/em&gt;, because the polar ice caps have melted, sending global sea levels up by 50 feet. All of Manhattan south of Central Park is now underwater, its famous grid of streets now a grid of canals. The lower floors of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company’s towers have been hardened to keep the water out, and the upper floors have been converted into co-ops of tiny efficiency apartments for well-off professionals — lawyers, investment bankers, influencers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tower where &lt;em&gt;New York 2140 &lt;/em&gt;is set is also an agricultural operation. There’s an open-walled farm floor on the upper level, supplying tomatoes, squash, and hydroponically grown greens for the co-op’s no-frills cafeteria. Pigs live on the farm, too, their meat available to any co-op resident motivated enough to personally raise and kill them. Salmon, trout, catfish, and clams grown in aquaculture cages in the body of water formerly known as Madison Square Park are another source of protein. The future New Yorkers of Robinson’s imagination have figured out how to live with climate change and how to eat relatively well in spite of it. The ones who can afford to live in one of the Met Life towers, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back in the present day, Daniel Humm, the owner and executive chef of Eleven Madison Park, has been rethinking his restaurant’s legacy. Earlier this year, Humm began offering a radically different vision for how rich New Yorkers will change their diets in the face of climate change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grist-_-Chef-Daniel-Humm.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grist-_-Chef-Daniel-Humm.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grist-_-Chef-Daniel-Humm.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grist-_-Chef-Daniel-Humm.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grist-_-Chef-Daniel-Humm.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;Chef Daniel Humm from Eleven Madison Park&quot; data-caption=&quot;Chef Daniel Humm.

 &lt;cite&gt;Ye Fan / Eleven Madison Park&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Humm made international headlines in May when he announced that his multiply-Michelin-starred fine dining restaurant would eliminate meat, fish, dairy, and eggs from its menu in the name of sustainability. “It became very clear to me that our idea of what luxury is had to change,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/dining/eleven-madison-park-vegan-menu.html&quot;&gt;Humm told the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. “We couldn’t go back to doing what we did before.” Humm has leaned into his new role as a climate luminary, recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CV20MgkooMl/&quot;&gt;appearing on a panel&lt;/a&gt; about sustainable luxury at the United Nations climate conference in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I started trying to get a reservation at Eleven Madison Park almost immediately after Humm announced the change, when I was freshly vaccinated and bursting with YOLO energy. As a longtime pescatarian who eats mostly vegan at home, I was curious whether the menu change was a landmark moment in the mainstreaming of plant-based eating. Could Eleven Madison Park — “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/dining/eleven-madison-park-vegan-menu.html&quot;&gt;basically a teaching institution&lt;/a&gt;,” according to American food dignitary Ruth Reichl — inspire other fine-dining restaurants to ditch planet-warming animal ingredients? Would those changes then trickle down to more affordable, accessible restaurants, making a real dent in Americans’ unsustainable rate of meat consumption and helping to bend the emissions curve that currently points toward a waterlogged future?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In late September, a few days after the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/28/dining/eleven-madison-park-restaurant-review-plant-based.html&quot;&gt;a subtly scathing review of Eleven Madison Park’s new menu&lt;/a&gt;, I finally locked down a reservation for me and my godmother, a meat-eater who loves trying vegan restaurants. Eleven Madison Park makes you pay in advance, and six courses for two people, including wine pairings and service, ran to $540 before tax. (Disclosure: Although I booked the reservation with the intention of paying for it out of pocket, Grist ultimately reimbursed me for my half of the meal; I in turn paid for half of my godmother’s half of the meal.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two hundred seventy dollars per person represents one of Eleven Madison Park’s more affordable options, the bar tasting menu with regular wine. The 10-course dining room tasting menu costs $335 per person before tax for the food, plus $175 to $335 for wine, depending on whether you want regular or “reserve” wine. I took some solace, I guess, in the claim that Eleven Madison Park provides five free meals for food-insecure New Yorkers for every dinner purchased at the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the night of our reservation, after we were seated beneath the bar room’s low ceiling printed with a panorama of a starry night sky, our primary server told us three things. The first was that Eleven Madison Park’s menu was not strictly vegan —&amp;nbsp;the restaurant still offered milk and honey with its coffee and tea service. “And this chair is leather,” the server quipped. He looked to be about Greta Thunberg’s age, as conciliatory as she is defiant but every bit her equal in preternatural poise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second was a brief history of the building, which the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company began constructing in 1929, intending for it to be taller than the Empire State Building. The Great Depression threw a wrench into those plans, and as a result the building has more elevator shafts than it does floors, he said. (Talk about a stranded asset!)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The third was that wine pairings amounted to about a bottle of wine per person.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grist-_-Culinary-1.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grist-_-Culinary-1.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grist-_-Culinary-1.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grist-_-Culinary-1.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grist-_-Culinary-1.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;Matsutake rice porridge with pine and ginger&quot; data-caption=&quot;Matsutake rice porridge with pine and ginger.

&lt;p&gt;The menu changes daily, according to the seasons and what’s available,&amp;nbsp;and each course strengthened my impression that the menu was a &lt;em&gt;haute &lt;/em&gt;riff on the relatable experience of desperately trying to get through an autumn CSA box before all the vegetables start rotting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first dish was a tiny bowl of rice porridge with a mix of mushrooms, topped with a couple of sheets of tofu skin and a drizzle of matsutake mushroom oil. Each grain of rice had been polished to order, according to the server who presented the bowls. (This was the start of a parade of deft, detail-oriented servers supplying &lt;em&gt;bon mots&lt;/em&gt; and fun facts about the ingredients and wine pairings.) The porridge was bracing, like a shot of umami straight to my sinuses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As I sipped the wine paired with the first course, a pleasantly prickly crémant de Bourgogne, I glanced around the bar area, pegging my fellow patrons as a mix of bank people and tech people and creatives, some of them in their natural habitat and others clearly out for a special occasion. The men wore suits or zippered sweaters; the women wore well-tailored blazers. At one point, a group of four handsome, wealthy-looking Boomers strutted into the bar area, commanding my attention with their utter ease in an environment I found intimidating; they ordered a drink at a bar and then were escorted to their place in the high-ceilinged dining room.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grist-_-Culinary-2.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grist-_-Culinary-2.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grist-_-Culinary-2.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grist-_-Culinary-2.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grist-_-Culinary-2.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;Confit beet, demi-sec beets, pickled jicama, and grapefruit from Eleven Madison Park&quot; data-caption=&quot;Confit beet, demi-sec beets, pickled jicama, and grapefruit.

 &lt;cite&gt;Evan Sung / Eleven Madison Park&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second course was a salad of pickled and roasted golden beets with jícama and grapefruit, served with a Riesling. The salad offered, oddly, more umami, only less jolting this time — the pickled beets tasted straightforwardly salty. The third course was a caviar imitation made out of seeds that burst and crackled pleasantly in my mouth, served on a base of almond cream and puréed squash. It would have been stunning — transcendent, even — if it hadn’t come on the heels of two courses hitting many of the same flavor notes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fourth course, “several preparation of kohlrabi,” came with two bites of sesame tofu —&amp;nbsp;a smooth, subtly sweet godsend. But the kohlrabi and tofu came in a puddle of dashi so briny I couldn’t finish it, though I did finish the paired Chardonnay.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this point, I should have been worried, and not only for the long-term well-being of my tongue’s salt receptors. The signs were staring me in the face that six courses were not going to be enough food to sustain a human adult for an evening. The only substantive things I had put in my mouth so far were a few spoonfuls of rice, almond cream, and sesame tofu, plus one and a half outstanding croissant-like rolls slathered with a satisfying butter imitation made from sunflower seeds. (A businesslike member of the waitstaff silently cleared the other half of the roll before I could finish it.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grist-_-Culinary-3.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grist-_-Culinary-3.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grist-_-Culinary-3.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grist-_-Culinary-3.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grist-_-Culinary-3.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;Pumpkin butter with bread rolls from Eleven Madison Park&quot; data-caption=&quot;Pumpkin butter with bread rolls.

 &lt;cite&gt;Evan Sung / Eleven Madison Park&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, I was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; worried, because I had already drunk about four glasses of wine on what was for all intents and purposes an empty stomach. (The wine was getting to other people in the bar area, too. A man&amp;nbsp; left his chair and sidled to the booth across the table to canoodle with his date; he looked a little chastened and dutifully returned to his seat when the servers appeared with the next course.) Between the wine, the world-class service, and the atmosphere — a lively jazz soundtrack played at the perfect volume to allow conversation, dim lighting calibrated to flatter — I felt deeply content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so when the final savory course arrived — a small deep-fried purse of cabbage leaves stuffed with a few pistachios —&amp;nbsp;it did not register to me as the metabolic disaster it was. I was too tipsy to fully grok the problem with eating five tiny courses made almost entirely of vegetables — and relieved to discover that the cabbage dish presented a break from the aggressive saltiness of the preceding courses, with a pleasantly toasty aroma and a refreshingly spicy pepper sauce. The dessert courses — a tiny bite of grape granita next to a tiny bite of coconut kulfi, and a sesame-flavored chocolate in the shape of a pretzel, each served with its own drink pairing —&amp;nbsp;only exacerbated the imbalance between alcohol and food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kim Stanley Robinson, in imagining the future of rich people eating in the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company’s former towers, accounted for the fact that human beings need protein to survive. The same thought does not appear to have occurred to Daniel Humm. My meal at Eleven Madison Park had all the trappings of “luxury.” It ended with a gift bag containing a canister full of granola and a complimentary bottle of housemade vermouth at the bar, where the bartender explained that the restaurant has a no-tipping policy because it’s “hospitality-based.” But no amount of hospitality, no matter how skilled, can make up for a lack of macronutrients. Finding my local pizza slice place closed when I got off the subway, I ended the night by frying up a few Field Roast vegan breakfast sausages, which sadly did not provide enough sustenance to prevent a debilitating hangover the next day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Waking up to a crushing headache, I found myself wondering whether I had misunderstood what the Eleven Madison Park bar tasting menu was even supposed to be. Is it possible it was meant to be a two-hour, six-course, $270-per-head snack? Should I have scheduled in time to get a cheese-stuffed mushroom burger at the Madison Square Park Shake Shack afterwards? I wanted to ask Humm, but he declined an interview via a publicist, who didn’t respond to my email asking what Humm thinks about the role of protein in the plant-based menu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emp2.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emp2.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emp2.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emp2.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emp2.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emp2.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emp2.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emp2.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;Interior of restaurant Eleven Madison Park in New York City&quot; data-caption=&quot;&quot; data-credit=&quot;Spencer Platt / Getty Images&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Spencer Platt / Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“How do you get enough protein?” is a question every vegan has fielded. The answers are abundant, even before you get to the increasingly realistic processed meat substitutes made by the likes of Impossible Burger. Beans, lentils, nuts, tofu, tempeh, and seitan are all amazingly versatile sources of plant-based protein. They can be whipped or seasoned into hearty meat, dairy, and egg substitutes or prepared simply and allowed to shine on their own. I hope Humm adds more of them to his menu, if Eleven Madison Park’s style of vegan cooking is going to trickle down to the mainstream.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The widespread adoption of plant-based eating in America will come one way or another — whether by choice, before increasingly severe drought and floods make meat too expensive for most people to afford, or by necessity, afterwards. Humm is clearly gunning for Westerners to make the transition sooner rather than later: A couple of weeks after I ate at Eleven Madison Park, Humm conspicuously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grubstreet.com/2021/11/daniel-humm-leaves-claridges-over-vegan-menu.html&quot;&gt;parted ways with the restaurant at Claridge’s Hotel in London over his vegan vision&lt;/a&gt;. A Claridge’s insider told the Daily Mail, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-10193337/EDEN-CONFIDENTIAL-Claridges-feels-queasy-star-chef-suggests-turning-restaurants-menu-vegan.html&quot;&gt;if they turn the restaurant vegan, they will upset thousands of regular guests&lt;/a&gt;.” A defiant Humm replied on Instagram, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CWLr0X8rW01/&quot;&gt;The future for me is plant-based&lt;/a&gt;.” Humm is clearly right on the merits. But after eating Humm’s particular approach to plant-based cooking at Eleven Madison Park, I wondered if Claridge’s primary concern wasn’t that guests leave angry but that they leave hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

He watched an excavator dig into the soil, its yellow, hydraulic arm moving against the green backdrop of forests that he has called home all his life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The area that was being prepared for construction lies within the territory of the Wet’suwet’en, a First Nation in what is currently called British Columbia, Canada. As a supporting chief from the Likhts’amisyu clan, Dsta’hyl had been tasked with enforcing Wet’suwet’en law in the area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scene he was witnessing — construction crews preparing to build a pipeline through Wet’suwet’en territory, without their consent — represented a blatant violation of those laws. And Dsta’hyl had seen enough. After warning the on-site construction managers that they were trespassing, he arrived the next day and approached a pair of orange-vested security subcontractors employed by TC Energy, the company building the fracked gas pipeline known as Coastal GasLink, or CGL. He notified them that he would be seizing one of their excavators and then stepped onto the hulking vehicle and disabled it by disconnecting its battery and other components. Though he planned to leave the vehicle in place, Dsta’hyl said he wanted to make a statement to the company, which the traditional leaders decided to evict from their territory last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Likhtsamisyu/status/1450125563721441292&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; posted on social media, one of the security workers asks Dsta’hyl what he wants from them. He lets out a hardy laugh.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For you guys to leave,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In another clip, Dsta’hyl stands on the vehicle as the workers below angle camcorders at him. “You guys are trespassing, and we want to make sure that you guys know that we mean business.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The crew members abandoned the area shortly after, driving off in their pickup trucks and construction vehicles — short one large piece of machinery. And while Dsta’hyl had gotten his message across, the asset-seizure was short-lived.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the middle of the night, they stole that one back,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That incident was one of the latest standoffs between the Wet’suwet’en and Coastal GasLink over the proposed pipeline, which, if completed, would carry 2 billion cubic feet per day of fracked gas from northeastern B.C. to a proposed processing facility on the Pacific coast. Although the company says it received all necessary permits and approvals to build the pipeline, the hereditary chiefs of the five clans of the Wet’suwet’en First Nation contend that because they never gave the company permission to build on their territory, the construction efforts violate their laws — not to mention Canada’s own laws.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tribe organizes itself into five clans, each of which is subdivided into multiple “houses.” The house chiefs oversee specific areas within the tribe’s traditional territory, which encompasses roughly 22,000 square kilometers (8,500 square miles). The hereditary chiefs make decisions that govern their territory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s quite an intricate governance system,” Dsta’hyl said, adding that the Wet’suwet’en have been practicing these laws for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Wet’suwet’en government was recognized in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/delgamuukw-vs-british-columbia-20-years-rights-titles-1.4440703&quot;&gt;1997 ruling&lt;/a&gt; by the Supreme Court of Canada, which held that the First Nation had never given up rights or title to their lands. And, like other First Nations in Canada’s westernmost province, the Wet’suwet’en never signed a treaty with the British Crown nor the Canadian government, meaning their territory is unceded land.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They never surrendered or ceded their territory, so what they’re dealing with is this incursion by pipeline companies and police who are basically invading,” said Clifford Atleo (Tsimshian, Nuu-chah-nulth), an assistant professor of resource and environmental management at Simon Fraser University whose work focuses on Indigenous governance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What the Wet’suwet’en are doing is protecting their lands,” Atleo said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/snowy-machinery.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/snowy-machinery.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/snowy-machinery.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/snowy-machinery.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/snowy-machinery.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/snowy-machinery.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/snowy-machinery.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/snowy-machinery.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-caption=&quot;Using a Coastal GasLink excavator, land defenders seize a minivan to use as a blockade.

&lt;p&gt;Fearing the destruction of their territory, as well as harmful impacts to water, wildlife and people, some members of the Wet’suwet’en have taken direct action against a slew of proposed pipelines over the past decade. They have created dozens of checkpoints and blockades to prevent construction crews from accessing Wet’suwet’en lands and significant sites. In 2009, members of the Unist’ot’en clan established a checkpoint near a small bridge that leads onto their territory, which they maintained alongside Indigenous and non-Indigenous allies for more than ten years. Another blockade was later built on the same road in the neighboring Gidimt’en territory, where, in January 2019, a series of police raids drew international media attention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Donning tactical gear and armed with military-style rifles, officers stormed the Gidimt’en checkpoint, arresting 14 land defenders as the officers dismantled the camp. Documents obtained by the Guardian suggest that the officers were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/20/canada-indigenous-land-defenders-police-documents&quot;&gt;prepared to use lethal force&lt;/a&gt; against Wet’suwet’en land defenders during the raid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A year later, the Unist’ot’en camp was raided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, or RCMP. Several people were arrested in the 2020 raid, during which officers sawed through a wooden barricade with the word “RECONCILIATION” painted on it, clearing the way for CGL crews to build on Wet’suwet’en territory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both incidents sparked renewed controversy regarding the tactics the RCMP employs in suppressing protests, with many critics highlighting the agency’s history of using excessive force against Indigenous land defenders as well as violent, anti-Indigenous sentiments &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.texasobserver.org/the-anti-indigenous-handbook/&quot;&gt;among its ranks&lt;/a&gt;. The RCMP asserts that the raids and ongoing patrols in the area are necessary to enforce a court order that prohibits protestors from blocking CGL construction. A provincial court handed down the injunction three years ago, and, in the time since, both the RCMP and the company have used the legal ruling to restrict access to certain areas and to arrest land defenders who stand in the way of the project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Indigenous people have continued to resist the pipeline, using tactics that escalated over the weekend, when members of the Gidimt’en clan demolished a section of road that CGL has used to access Wet’suwet’en territory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Sunday morning, CGL employees and subcontractors were given an immediate evacuation order. “You have eight hours to vacate the territory peacefully,” said Sleydo’, a supporting chief from the Gidimt’en clan, who made the announcement over the radio. “Failure to comply will result in immediate road closure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But land defenders saw little movement along the road — even after the company negotiated for a two-hour extension. When members of the group approached a man camp they had ordered to disband, they discovered construction crews were not preparing to leave, and had positioned multiple construction vehicles and machinery on the road, said Jennifer Wickham, a member of the Gidimt’en clan who serves as media coordinator for the group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response, land defenders seized a CGL excavator and destroyed a segment of the roadway before dropping a crumpled minivan at a bridgehead. Wickham said that, given RCMP’s previous enforcement of injunctions, a police raid may be imminent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We absolutely expect them to do that,” she said. “As far as when, we have no idea.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an email, an RCMP spokesperson said the agency “is aware of the protest actions and we have, and will continue to have, a police presence in [the] area conducting roving patrols. No arrests were made and we continue to monitor the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hereditary chiefs of the Wet’suwet’en say the injunction, RCMP’s enforcement of it, and the project itself represent an affront to First Nations sovereignty, pointing to the 1997 Supreme Court decision as proof that they have the constitutional right to expel CGL from their territory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In what is known as the Delgamuukw case, the court confirmed that “Aboriginal title is a right to the land itself” based on occupation of the area and a system of law that predates British and Canadian colonization. The Supreme Court decision left many issues unresolved, though, such as the exact boundaries of the tribe’s traditional territories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the house chiefs’ legally recognized authority, the pipeline company never engaged in meaningful consultation with them, Sleydo’ said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They will send information, but they don’t actually give us the opportunity to engage with that information, and when we have responded, they disregard everything we say,” she said. “That’s not consultation and it’s definitely not consent.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company frequently states that it received approval from the Wet’suwet’en because it negotiated an agreement with the tribe’s elected band councils. Imposed by the Canadian government under the Indian Act of 1876, the band-council system was created to facilitate interactions between First Nations and the federal government. The councils are considered the governing bodies for their respective First Nation reserves, and elected representatives from 20 band councils along the pipeline route signed so-called “benefit agreements” with the company to allow construction. Although councils from multiple reserves within Wet’suwet’en territory approved the project, the hereditary chiefs — as representatives of older, traditional styles of government — say they retain authority over their traditional lands, and that CGL needs their permission to access the territory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company claims it has sought numerous meetings with the hereditary chiefs in the past two years, and that it continues to seek input from Wet’suwet’en leaders “with the sincere hope of developing a respectful and constructive relationship as we move to completion of the Project and beyond.” In an email, CGL spokesperson Natasha Westover cited safety concerns as justification for blocking Wet’suwet’en people from their territory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Coastal GasLink has an obligation to facilitate access for [I]ndigenous peoples to their traditional territories, however, that access may be delayed where it is unsafe [to] provide access immediately,” she said. Westover declined to provide an interview with CGL executives or other personnel for this story, despite multiple requests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After CGL’s injunction was made permanent last winter the Wet’suwet’en house chiefs unanimously decided to evict the company from its territories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/protesters-macmillan-yard.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/protesters-macmillan-yard.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/protesters-macmillan-yard.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/protesters-macmillan-yard.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/protesters-macmillan-yard.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/protesters-macmillan-yard.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/protesters-macmillan-yard.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/protesters-macmillan-yard.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;Protesters occupy Macmillan Yard&quot; data-caption=&quot;Hundreds of protesters in Ontario march in solidarity with Wet’suwet’en land defenders after police raids drew international attention in February 2020.

&lt;p&gt;Flowing from a glacier-fed lake, Wedzin Kwa runs through the heart of Wet’suwet’en territory. The river provides important spawning grounds for salmon, and supplies community members with unpolluted drinking water.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You could swim in that lake and just open your mouth and drink the water, it’s so pristine,” Sleydo’ said. “And the river is so clear that you can see these very deep spawning beds that the salmon have been returning to for thousands of years.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CGL plans to construct the pipeline beneath the river. In September, when members of the Gidimt’en clan heard that construction crews were preparing to tunnel under Wedzin Kwa, they rushed to occupy the site. They have since erected several structures, including a cabin with a full kitchen and multiple solar-powered “tiny homes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the conflicts with RCMP in recent years have escalated in the dead of winter, the Gidim’ten clan has experience erecting blockades in temperatures as low as minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, and welcomed the chance to set up camp with only a light snow in the ground.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Blockade season came early this year,” Sleydo’ said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the mounting tensions, Sleydo’ said the members of camp try to remain upbeat, laughing and telling stories around the campfire at night.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the mood changes when the RCMP approaches the area. In the days after the outpost was established, RCMP officers tasered a person and injured a man who had locked himself to the underside of a bus. Sleydo’ said officers grabbed the man by the legs and repeatedly lifted his body and slammed him onto the ground as a way of forcing him to unclip himself from the vehicle. She said the RCMP’s use of “pain compliance” equates to torture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That person is still receiving ongoing medical care and has [nerve damage] in his hands,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The national police force frequently sends members of a specialized division with a reputation of using excessive force against protestors. Known as the Community-Industry Response Group, or C-IRG, the roving unit draws RCMP officers from far-flung areas of Canada to break up protest camps that form in opposition to pipelines, mining projects and logging operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Officers with the unit have been widely criticized in recent months for their aggressive tactics in breaking up anti-logging protests near Fairy Creek on Vancouver Island. In addition to making violent arrests and showering unarmed protestors with pepper spray, many of the officers &lt;a href=&quot;https://briarpatchmagazine.com/articles/view/climate-action-defunding-police-CIRG-RCMP-Fairy-Creek&quot;&gt;removed all forms of identification&lt;/a&gt; from their uniforms during multiple raids. British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Douglas W. Thompson &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/world/canada/british-columbia-fairy-creek-protests.html&quot;&gt;condemned those actions&lt;/a&gt; in his decision to end an injunction against the Fairy Creek protestors, writing that RCMP’s enforcement tactics “have led to serious and substantial infringement of civil liberties.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During RCMP raids on Wet’suwet’en territory, officers often brandish sniper rifles and bring in police dogs to intimidate land defenders, Sleydo’ said. “If we’re trying to defend a space, we’re considered a huge threat,” she said. “And they use that as an excuse to use violence and excessive force against us.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency’s media relations team did not provide a phone interview despite multiple requests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image alignfull js-breaks-column&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/witset-canyon.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/witset-canyon.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/witset-canyon.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/witset-canyon.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/witset-canyon.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/witset-canyon.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/witset-canyon.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/witset-canyon.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-caption=&quot;The Bulkley River runs through Wet’suwet’en and Gitxsan territory.

&lt;p&gt;Miles Howe, an assistant professor of critical criminology at Brock University, said the RCMP often engages in “political policing,” in that the agency targets groups that are considered threats to Canada’s access to natural resources —&amp;nbsp;and, by extension, the economic interests surrounding the extraction of those resources. Howe co-authored &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/cjs/index.php/CJS/article/view/29397/21432?fbclid=IwAR0gOWPQ6ZE6Om8Tq4u0vO1rF2ndSSfvbtjLOeM4U_B2F_YzYeqRNuipHQw&quot;&gt;a 2019 report&lt;/a&gt; that used documents obtained through records requests to show that the RCMP performed extensive surveillance of Indigenous land defenders and assessed the risk posed by protestors not based on criminality, but on their ability to rally public support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The RCMP raids in early 2020 sparked nationwide protests in Canada, leading Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to voice tepid support for Wet’suwet’en sovereignty, though he later demanded that the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/02/21/808301527/canadian-pm-trudeau-says-rail-barricades-must-come-down-doesn-t-say-how&quot;&gt;barricades come down&lt;/a&gt;.” Months later, federal and provincial government officials agreed to engage in land-rights negotiations with the hereditary chiefs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So far, nothing has come from that process,” said Jennifer Wickham, who serves as media coordinator for the Gidimt’en resistance group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, the Canadian government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iisd.org/system/files/2021-07/oil-gas-pipelines-green-recovery-canada.pdf&quot;&gt;has subsidized Coastal GasLink&lt;/a&gt; and continues to tout the benefits of liquified natural gas as a “transition fuel” that will set Canada on a course to reach its ambitious climate goals. Earlier this month, Trudeau took the stage at the UN climate change conference in Scotland to outline Canada’s plan to cap oil and gas emissions in order to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s no small task for a major oil and gas producing country,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But critics say Trudeau’s commitments run counter to his administration’s support of natural gas projects, which have been shown to leak large amounts of &lt;span class=&quot;tooltipsall tooltipsincontent classtoolTips3&quot;&gt;methane&lt;/span&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;https://grist.org/energy/cutting-methane-is-the-fastest-way-to-slow-warming-heres-how/&quot;&gt;a powerful greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt; — into the atmosphere. Given the outsize impacts climate change often has on Native communities, Indigenous rights advocates say it is critical that First Nations are adequately consulted on resource-extractive projects that take place on their ancestral lands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the UN’s special rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous peoples implored the Canadian government to seek the “free, prior and informed consent” of First Nations in the early stages of a project. The U.N. Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples states that Natives “have the right to own, use, develop and control the lands, territories and resources that they possess by reason of traditional ownership” and that they “shall not be forcibly removed from their territories.” Earlier this year, legislators passed a bill aimed at implementing UNDRIP into Canadian law.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And yet, the government is enabling Coastal GasLink to push its pipeline through Wet’suwet’en territory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sleydo’ said the group is “digging in for winter,” and has no intention of allowing the pipeline to cross Wedzin Kwa. The mother of three children said that, although it has been difficult being away from her family during the occupation, she refuses to pass the pipeline’s impacts down to her children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They will not drill under our sacred headwaters because we’re going to defend this space until the end,” she said. “We’re not going anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;

France decided to find out.</title><description>&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;At first, Sylvain Burquier thought it was a joke.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was August 2019, and Burquier and his two children were at their home in Paris’s Ninth Arrondissement, off the right bank of the River Seine, when his phone rang. It was a representative of the French government calling to ask if the then- 45-year-old marketing manager would participate in a political experiment. President Emmanuel Macron wanted to slash the country’s carbon emissions over the next decade, and he was enlisting a group of randomly selected citizens to help him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was a bizarre request — but one that, given recent history, made some sense. The French president’s previous attempts to address climate change had run aground, tanking his popularity and throwing the country into turmoil. Just a year and a half into his first term, in November 2018, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.france24.com/en/20181217-france-yellow-vests-battle-popular-referendum-RIC-citizens-initiative-macron-philippe&quot;&gt;hundreds of thousands of protesters&lt;/a&gt; clad in yellow reflecting vests (known in France as the &lt;em&gt;gilets jaunes&lt;/em&gt;) took to the streets to protest Macron’s fuel tax increase, which would have lifted the levies on gasoline and diesel by up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/world/europe/france-fuel-tax-yellow-vests.html&quot;&gt;25 cents per gallon&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to speed the country’s shift away from fossil fuels. The &lt;em&gt;gilets jaunes&lt;/em&gt; burned cars and smashed windows, covering walls and statues across Paris with anti-Macron graffiti. “We’ve cut off heads for less than this,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/world/europe/france-macron-yellow-vest-protests.html&quot;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; one scrawl on the Arc de Triomphe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/yellow-vest-protest-paris.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/yellow-vest-protest-paris.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/yellow-vest-protest-paris.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/yellow-vest-protest-paris.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/yellow-vest-protest-paris.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/yellow-vest-protest-paris.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/yellow-vest-protest-paris.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/yellow-vest-protest-paris.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;a man in a yellow vest waves a french flag in front of bright green barricades&quot; data-caption=&quot;A “yellow vest” demonstrator waves the French flag on a burning barricade on the Champs-Elysees avenue with the Arc de Triomphe in the background in 2018. &quot; data-credit=&quot;AP Photo / Michel Euler&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A “yellow vest” demonstrator waves the French flag on a burning barricade on the Champs-Elysees avenue with the Arc de Triomphe in the background in 2018.  &lt;cite&gt;AP Photo / Michel Euler&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Macron eventually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/world/europe/france-fuel-tax-yellow-vests.html&quot;&gt;suspended the fuel tax&lt;/a&gt;, and a few months later, he announced a new strategy: The government would spend &lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegieeurope.eu/2020/11/05/getting-climate-citizens-assemblies-right-pub-83133&quot;&gt;5.4 million euros&lt;/a&gt; ($6.3 million) to create a 150-person, randomly selected “citizens’ convention on climate.” The group would advise the French parliament, and the president himself, on how to cut carbon pollution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was not the first time that randomly selected citizens had been asked to advise — or even stand in for — politicians on the most contentious issues of the day. Over the past few decades, assemblies focused on everything from gay marriage to nuclear power have taken place in Asia, Europe, and North America. In 2017, a citizens’ assembly in Ireland drafted new recommendations &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thejournal.ie/citizens-assembly-vote-3354416-Apr2017/&quot;&gt;on abortion&lt;/a&gt;, which lead to its legalization in the largely Catholic country a year later. In Texas, several “deliberative polls” (a poll, town meeting, and lecture wrapped into one) of utility customers between 1996 and 1998 helped turn the fossil fuel-filled state toward &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy03osti/33177.pdf&quot;&gt;wind power&lt;/a&gt;. The world, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oecd.org/gov/innovative-citizen-participation-and-new-democratic-institutions-339306da-en.htm&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, is witnessing a “deliberative wave” as governments eschew traditional modes of democracy for new, experimental forms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image alignfull js-breaks-column&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-group-gathered-outside-paris.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-group-gathered-outside-paris.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-group-gathered-outside-paris.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-group-gathered-outside-paris.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-group-gathered-outside-paris.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-group-gathered-outside-paris.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-group-gathered-outside-paris.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-group-gathered-outside-paris.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;a group of people stand outside a government building&quot; data-caption=&quot;Members of the Citizens’ Convention for the Climate arrive at the Elysée Palace for a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in June 2020.  &quot; data-credit=&quot;Andrea Savorani Neri/ NurPhoto&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Members of the Citizens’ Convention for the Climate arrive at the Elysée Palace for a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in June 2020.   &lt;cite&gt;Andrea Savorani Neri/ NurPhoto&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Proponents say that citizens’ assemblies can dissolve partisan boundaries, return power to the people, and — on the problem of climate change — break through a political gridlock that endangers the entire planet. Over the past several years, dozens of assemblies focused on climate change have taken place in Europe and the U.S. One group even attempted to create a 100-person “&lt;a href=&quot;https://globalassembly.org/&quot;&gt;global assembly&lt;/a&gt;” on climate change in the run-up to this month’s international climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether such groups can succeed and what, in fact, should count as a “success” remain open questions. Unlike legalizing abortion or gay marriage, converting a country’s entire energy system to low-carbon sources is deeply technical — perhaps too much so for a hundred randomly selected people to fully grasp, let alone solve, over the course of a few months. Citizens’ assemblies also vary widely in their structure and the support they garner from government officials. Should an assembly be a kind of glorified focus group, a venue for citizens to share their views? Or can it actually help generate and pass new legislation?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the phone, Burquier answered questions about his age, gender, educational background, and profession. Then, he waited. The government had called or texted approximately 255,000 people, and only a small fraction would be selected through a method called “sortition,” which would attempt to recreate the demographics of the country in miniature. (Most demographics, anyway: France doesn’t recognize &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/07/france-race-racism-grande-ecoles/613924/&quot;&gt;race or religion in its statistics&lt;/a&gt;.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two months later, Burquier got another call: He was in. Roughly once a month for the next nine months, he — along with 149 other French voters — would report to an ornate government building in the center of Paris, less than half a mile from the Eiffel Tower. They would meet with legislators, scientists, experts, and Macron himself, crafting recommendations on how the government should tackle climate change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were also equipped with a pledge from Macron: that he would submit their final proposals to the French Parliament, put them up for a public referendum, or sign them directly into law &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.francetvinfo.fr/monde/environnement/convention-citoyenne-sur-le-climat/convention-citoyenne-pour-le-climat-comment-le-discours-d-emmanuel-macron-sur-les-propositions-a-t-il-evolue_4209195.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;sans filtre&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — “without filter.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was a promise that he would find difficult to keep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;It’s often said that democracy is in decline, crumpling under the weight of staggering inequality, the lightning speed with which online misinformation spreads, and a rising populism that rewards politicians with an authoritarian bent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the Pew Research Center, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/03/31/many-in-us-western-europe-say-their-political-system-needs-major-reform/&quot;&gt;65 percent of Americans&lt;/a&gt; believe that their political system needs either “major changes” or “to be completely reformed.” Sixty-eight percent of French adults feel similarly about their system, as do 47 percent of those in the U.K. about theirs. Some have argued that countries are entering an era of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/post-democracy-populism/&quot;&gt;post-democracy&lt;/a&gt;,” in which the standard trappings of democracy continue (regular elections, a free press, separation of powers) but elected representatives rarely give voters what they want. In 2014, political scientists at Princeton University and Northwestern University analyzed over 20 years’ worth of U.S. policy data and &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf&quot;&gt;found no correlation&lt;/a&gt; between the preferences of the majority and actual political outcomes. Some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/&quot;&gt;81 percent&lt;/a&gt; of Americans support wider background checks for gun purchases, for example, but Congress has shown little interest in passing stricter gun laws. “When a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites or with organized interests, they generally lose,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Climate change is no exception. Although citizens of many countries view &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/18/a-look-at-how-people-around-the-world-view-climate-change/&quot;&gt;global warming as a serious threat&lt;/a&gt;, international climate summits — including COP26 in Glasgow — have seen far more talk than action. Since 1992, when representatives from more than 150 countries gathered in Rio de Janeiro and pledged to limit the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, global CO2 emissions have actually &lt;em&gt;risen&lt;/em&gt; by more than 60 percent. Some individual countries have succeeded in reducing the &lt;span class=&quot;tooltipsall tooltipsincontent classtoolTips1&quot;&gt;greenhouse gases&lt;/span&gt; they spew into the sky (the United Kingdom, for instance, has managed to cut emissions by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-why-the-uks-co2-emissions-have-fallen-38-since-1990&quot;&gt;38 percent since 1990&lt;/a&gt;, largely thanks to a phaseout of coal), but most are lagging far behind. Attempts to levy higher taxes on pollution in France and Canada have run into popular protest and, despite current efforts in Congress, the U.S. hasn’t passed significant climate legislation since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, citizens’ assemblies can seem like a remedy — or potentially a last resort. Gather 100 to 150 average voters in a room, the thinking goes, and they might be able to cut through polarizing divides and come up with new, innovative policies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hélène Landemore, a professor of political science at Yale University and the author of &lt;em&gt;Open Democracy&lt;/em&gt;, told me that, in theory, citizens’ assemblies can be more representative than traditional democracies — and ultimately, more fair. Most governments give power to elected officials who often already &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; power in the form of money, connections, or public recognition. Citizens’ assemblies hand power directly to the people (or at least, a randomly selected subset of them). “It’s not that elected officials are bad individually,” Landemore said. “But as a group, they tend to lack diversity, and they tend to be blind to certain problems.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s evidence that putting people with opposing opinions in the same room can help root out polarization. In 2019, two Stanford professors gathered 523 registered U.S. voters in the small town of Grapevine, Texas, just outside of Dallas. They were part of a project called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/opinion/america-one-room-experiment.html&quot;&gt;America in One Room&lt;/a&gt;” — a four-day “deliberative poll” on issues ranging from immigration to whether the country should start providing each citizen $1,000 per month in universal basic income. At the beginning of the experiment, Republicans and Democrats were torn on essential questions around health care, taxes, and the environment. By the end of the long weekend, however, the poles had shifted toward the middle. Among Democrats, support for a $15 minimum wage dropped from 83 percent to 59 percent, while Republicans’ support for visas for low-skilled workers jumped from 31 percent to 66 percent. (Discussions about the environment and climate change produced smaller shifts in opinion.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But changing opinions is not the same thing as changing policy — and there, citizens’ assemblies have had a more rocky history. Recommendations are rarely implemented directly by governments; at best, they are often submitted to a public referendum. In Ireland, a constitutional convention in 2012 and the citizens’ assembly in 2017 recommended legalizing gay marriage and overturning a constitutional ban on abortion, both of which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/the-myth-of-the-citizens-assembly-democracy/&quot;&gt;later passed&lt;/a&gt; in country-wide referenda. A 160-person assembly in British Columbia in 2004, on the other hand, recommended changes to the province’s voting system that were later narrowly rejected by the population at large.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Farrell, a professor of political science at the University of Dublin who helped advise the Irish government on its assemblies, says that success can come down to the topics at hand. It’s best, he said, if they provoke some kind of “underlying emotion” that can capture public attention, as hot-button issues like gay marriage, abortion, and climate change might.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there isn’t consensus on what, in an ideal world, assemblies &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; strive to accomplish. Farrell argues that assemblies can play a somewhat advisory role, both by demonstrating that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; public support for controversial policies — as in Ireland’s abortion case — and by providing politicians with cover against future backlash. (That’s something Macron might have found useful after the Yellow Vests protests.) “These processes help guide politicians,” Farrell said. “That doesn’t mean you have to agree with them, but you have to engage with them.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Others, including Landemore, have suggested a more sweeping role for assemblies — as a third house of a legislature, or as a replacement for the current form of representative democracy altogether. She pointed to a group of citizens, selected by lottery, who played a vital role in the first democracy. “We have a historic precedent,” she said. “The Council of 500 in ancient Greece.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;The first weekend that the 150 members of the French convention met in October 2019, Burquier experienced what he and other members came to call “&lt;em&gt;la claque&lt;/em&gt;,” or “the shock.” The members had gathered in a tiered, wood-paneled amphitheater of the French Economic, Social, and Environmental Council building, the Paris home of France’s third (and purely advisory) house of parliament. It was designed to look and feel grandiose: Microphones lined the semicircular room, and cameramen and journalists hovered in the background. The citizens, sitting in plush red chairs with briefing papers and notebooks spread out before them, looked for all the world like lawmakers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image&quot;&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;p&gt;Members of France’s Citizens’ Convention for the Climate gather to listen and discuss the issues. Photos by Katrin Baumann&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The convention proceeded in two parts. For the first several sessions, the assembled citizens learned about climate change and proposed solutions; in the final months, they deliberated and prepared their recommendations. In the amphitheater of the council building, or in its more airy, columned atrium, participants listened to scientists, policy experts, and diplomats explain the dangers of greenhouse gases and how they touched every component of modern life. They were then split into five groups, each focused on a subject — consumption, travel, housing, production and work, and food — and tasked with coming up with recommendations that would help France cut its carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As scientists and other experts began to describe the crisis of climate change, Burquier said the assembly was struck by the enormity of the problem — and the enormity of what they were being asked to do. “They said, ‘Now it’s your job to propose solutions,’” he said. “It felt like a very big hole that we had to fill.” France, he noted, is a country of 67 million people; each member of the convention was effectively being asked to represent 450,000 other citizens.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The assembly was expected to be confined to eight weekends, but the deliberations soon took over participants’ lives. On Friday and Saturday evenings, they would congregate at a nearby hotel — where those from outside Paris stayed during the convention —&amp;nbsp;or at restaurants, drinking beers and discussing what they had learned away from the prying eyes of journalists and researchers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amandine Roggeman, a 27-year-old Parisian who works in fundraising at the Palace of Versailles, told me that she and many other convention members began to do their own reading during the week, stealing time after work. “The normal weekend sessions,” she said, “were just the tip of the iceberg.” After COVID-19 forced a meeting online, they started congregating over Zoom during the week, sometimes from 6 to 9 p.m. (For their nine months of effort, each participant was paid 1,462 euros, or $1,695.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the contentiousness of the issues, members of the assembly insist that disagreements were minimal. Faced with the stark 2030 goal, Roggeman said, “You feel like you don’t have time to argue.” Her group, which focused on consumption, sometimes sparred over the importance of buying local (low-carbon, but too expensive for many poor, rural members of the convention). Once COVID-19 struck, they haggled over whether the convention would go fully remote or remain in-person. Most of the issues were resolved through careful conversation, thanks to trained political mediators who were hired for the occasion to help ensure that everyone received roughly equal time to speak and that discussions didn’t devolve into infighting. “Those people were essential,” Roggeman told me. “They were the ones putting oil in the machine.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image alignfull js-breaks-column&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-press.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-press.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-press.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-press.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-press.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-press.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-press.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-press.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;a large lit sign for the citizens assembly with a bunch of people on stage&quot; data-caption=&quot;French President Emmanuel Macron participates in the Citizens’ Convention for the Climate held at the French Economic, Social and Environmental Council headquarters in Paris. &quot; data-credit=&quot;Yoan Valat / AFP via Getty Images&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;French President Emmanuel Macron participates in the Citizens’ Convention for the Climate held at the French Economic, Social and Environmental Council headquarters in Paris.  &lt;cite&gt;Yoan Valat / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The real conflicts came between the members of the assembly and the organizers themselves. Every hour of each weekend had been carefully planned in advance, and as the months wore on, the assembly began to get restless, frustrated that — despite their role as selected representatives of the French people — they had little control over the convention’s operations. They feuded with the organizers over voting procedures, the selection of speakers, and the schedule. Once, when an expert came to talk about the benefits of a carbon tax, they grew angry, sensing that they were being led toward the political “third rail” that had sparked the &lt;em&gt;gilets jaunes&lt;/em&gt; protests in the first place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the members gradually found that the organizers were essential to the smooth running of the convention. One day, during a discussion about a trade agreement between the European Union and Canada, they insisted on being left alone for two hours to debate — without any mediators or organizers present. The meeting devolved into a shouting match, and one by one all of the members walked out. After that blowup, Landemore, who spent months observing the assembly, said the group was more amenable to the organizers’ suggestions. “It’s not that they’re children in need of control,” she said. “But they are a large number of people — they need structure.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In June 2020, after months of work, the convention finally released its list of 149 &lt;a href=&quot;https://propositions.conventioncitoyennepourleclimat.fr/&quot;&gt;proposals&lt;/a&gt;. Burquier was jubilant. Their ideas were comprehensive, covering all aspects of French life, and some were radical. They recommended banning the construction of new airports, taxing corporate dividends to pay for green programs, and revising the constitution to make damaging the environment a crime. Others seemed commonsense: Members supported mandatory recycling and removing oil and coal heating systems from homes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The members were eager to present their proposals to Macron. The president had visited the convention multiple times to answer questions and encourage the group to take its job seriously.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image alignfull js-breaks-column&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/macron-listening-citizens-assembly.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/macron-listening-citizens-assembly.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/macron-listening-citizens-assembly.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/macron-listening-citizens-assembly.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/macron-listening-citizens-assembly.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/macron-listening-citizens-assembly.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/macron-listening-citizens-assembly.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/macron-listening-citizens-assembly.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;a man in a blue jacket holds his face and turns his head to the side amidst a large crowd of people&quot; data-caption=&quot;French President Emmanuel Macron attends a meeting in which representatives from various French cities share residents’ concerns.

&lt;p&gt;But just days after the convention released its recommendations, the tacit agreement Macron had made with the convention — that he would submit the recommendations to parliament or to a nationwide referendum “without filter” — began to break down. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0F-uslFshA&quot;&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; to convention members on the lawn of the Élysée Palace, the French president’s official residence, Macron announced that he was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.francetvinfo.fr/monde/environnement/convention-citoyenne-sur-le-climat/referendum-limitation-a-110-km-h-ecocide-ce-qu-il-faut-retenir-du-discours-d-emmanuel-macron-devant-la-convention-citoyenne-pour-le-climat_4027415.html&quot;&gt;rejecting&lt;/a&gt; three of the 149 proposals, including a tax on corporate dividends to fund green programs and a nationwide speed limit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.francetvinfo.fr/sante/maladie/coronavirus/110-km-h-sur-autoroute-trois-quarts-des-francais-opposes-a-la-proposition-de-la-convention-citoyenne-selon-notre-sondage_4021651.html&quot;&gt;68 miles per hour&lt;/a&gt;. A national speed limit, Macron warned, could prove too controversial; a tax on dividends might discourage investors. He called the canceled proposals his “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/French-President-drops-climate-idea-to-lower-motorway-speed-among-three-joker-climate-convention-suggestions-not-kept&quot;&gt;three jokers&lt;/a&gt;.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That was just the beginning. Over the next few months, members of the convention watched in frustration as government ministers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.francetvinfo.fr/monde/environnement/convention-citoyenne-sur-le-climat/climat-sept-propositions-de-la-convention-citoyenne-ecartees-par-le-gouvernement-malgre-la-promesse-d-emmanuel-macron_4123179.html&quot;&gt;discarded or watered down&lt;/a&gt; many of their remaining recommendations. The ban on new airports was thrown out, as was a plan to incorporate the fight against climate change into the country’s constitution. Members of the assembly were sometimes asked with little notice and no preparation to appear before government committees or lobbyists to defend their proposals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Landemore, the Yale professor, saw the group’s frustration firsthand. “Those proposals were their baby,” she said. “They felt like they were being cheated.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-woman-speaks-microphone.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-woman-speaks-microphone.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-woman-speaks-microphone.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-woman-speaks-microphone.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-woman-speaks-microphone.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-woman-speaks-microphone.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-woman-speaks-microphone.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-woman-speaks-microphone.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;a woman in a blue sweater and yellow scarf holds a microphone as she speaks.

&lt;p&gt;Members began pushing back. Some gave interviews to French television. Burquier, who had never appeared on TV or radio before, soon became comfortable making public appearances. Last October, the members wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.francetvinfo.fr/monde/environnement/convention-citoyenne-sur-le-climat/climat-les-150-citoyens-de-la-convention-interpellent-emmanuel-macron-afin-qu-il-renouvelle-son-soutien-et-son-envie-ferme-de-faire-aboutir-leurs-propositions_4139025.html&quot;&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to Macron, imploring him to follow through on his original promises. Cyril Dion, a French documentary filmmaker and one of the convention’s “guarantors,” started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.avaaz.org/campaign/fr/france_convention_climat_rb3/&quot;&gt;petition online&lt;/a&gt; to “save the citizens’ convention on climate,” which ultimately garnered over 500,000 signatures. “We are asking today that the President of the Republic keep his word,” Dion wrote.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By December, Macron had had enough. In an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.francetvinfo.fr/monde/environnement/convention-citoyenne-sur-le-climat/video-convention-pour-le-climat-comment-a-evolue-le-sans-filtre-demmanuel-macron_4224591.html&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with the French media site Brut, he lashed out. “I have 150 citizens. I respect them,” he snapped. “But you can’t say that just because 150 citizens wrote something, it’s the Bible or the Quran.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We were too much pressure for the government,” Burquier told me. It was a Frankenstein moment, he explained: Macron had created a monster, and then lost control.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;While the 150 members of the French convention were meeting in the Parisian council building, other assemblies continued popping up all over the globe. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.involve.org.uk/citizens-assembly-tracker&quot;&gt;More than a dozen&lt;/a&gt; climate assemblies have taken place in U.K. cities over the last few years, sparked in part by the U.K.-based activist group Extinction Rebellion.&amp;nbsp;In January 2020, six committees of Parliament helped form a 108-member climate assembly in the United Kingdom, with a goal of helping the country reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. And in Washington state, &lt;a href=&quot;https://crosscut.com/environment/2021/01/washington-hosts-first-climate-assembly-united-states&quot;&gt;an 80-person assembly&lt;/a&gt; convened over Zoom at the start of the year to recommend climate policies to the state legislature.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image alignfull js-breaks-column&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/extinction-rebellion-citizens-assembly.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/extinction-rebellion-citizens-assembly.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/extinction-rebellion-citizens-assembly.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/extinction-rebellion-citizens-assembly.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/extinction-rebellion-citizens-assembly.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/extinction-rebellion-citizens-assembly.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/extinction-rebellion-citizens-assembly.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/extinction-rebellion-citizens-assembly.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;a large pink banner and a group of portesters with a giant fake fish prop&quot; data-caption=&quot;Activists from Extinction Rebellion attend a general meeting on the Chatelet square, in the center of Paris.

The banner reads “Citizens’ assembly.”  &lt;cite&gt;AP Photo / Thibault Camus&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Almost all of these assemblies have shown that randomly selected citizens can agree — at least in a managed, mediated environment — on major policy changes. The U.K. assembly, for example, proposed levying a tax on frequent flyers and reducing the country’s meat consumption by up to 40 percent. The Washington Climate Assembly endorsed building electric vehicle chargers and investing in carbon capture technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the results have been mixed in terms of assemblies attracting attention, let alone getting policies passed. The U.K. assembly was designed more like a focus group, a venue to gauge public opinion; it wasn’t expected to formulate new legislation or new policy. (It also had one-tenth of the funding given to the French assembly.) Its final 50-plus recommendations were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/10/uk-climate-assembly-economic-recovery-from-covid-must-tackle-global-heating&quot;&gt;covered by the media&lt;/a&gt; and discussed in Parliament when they were released last year, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government offered no concrete promise to follow through.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Washington state, Barry Scovel, a 67-year-old member of the climate assembly, told me that the group had a “Meet &amp;amp; Greet” with state lawmakers over Zoom in March, but within 10 to 15 minutes the legislators began dropping off, with some giving apologies. They were in the middle of a legislative session and didn’t have time to listen to all of the assembly’s suggestions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Against that backdrop, the French assembly’s tussles with Macron start to look like features rather than bugs. “The French model is far from perfect,” said Rich Wilson, a deliberative democracy expert and director of the U.K.-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://osca.co/&quot;&gt;social impact lab&lt;/a&gt; Osca. But, he added, the discussion started by the 150 citizens was mirrored around the country, and many of the group’s recommendations — a nationwide 68-mile-per-hour speed limit, for example, or a push for vegetarian meals — were debated and discussed by the wider French public. That national discussion, Wilson says, is the “critical success criteria” that can spark political change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Landemore agrees. Although she found Macron’s “without filter” promise a bit foolish — “of course there would have to be &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; kind of filter,” she told me — she thought the president’s vow, and the resulting conflict, brought attention to the convention. Some 70 percent of French citizens had heard of the convention by the time it had wrapped up its work in June 2020, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://reseauactionclimat.org/sondage-des-gaulois-pas-si-refractaires-a-laction-climatique/&quot;&gt;polling&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by the Climate Action Network; 64 percent considered its work “useful.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Proponents of assemblies argue that there’s no reason the model can’t succeed elsewhere, including in the United States. While the U.S. is more polarized than France on climate change — only &lt;a href=&quot;https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-march-2021/3/&quot;&gt;70 percent of Americans polled&lt;/a&gt; think that the planet is warming, compared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/docs/fabre-adrien/last-version--french-attitudes.pdf&quot;&gt;92 percent&lt;/a&gt; of French respondents — similar projects have worked in the U.S. in the past. In the 1990s, those meetings in Texas with utility customers turned skeptics of wind power into supporters. Before the eight sessions, only 52 percent of participants were willing to pay more on their utility bills to support renewable energy. Afterward, the number jumped to 84 percent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And despite deep differences between political parties, a majority of Americans &lt;a href=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5bb4d5ed16b64071e405f888/t/5f884afc626d312807185237/1602767614115/TCCCEN-CleanEnergy-Climate-Survey.pdf&quot;&gt;of all stripes&lt;/a&gt; want action to rein in greenhouse gases. According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/05/26/climate-energy-and-environmental-policy/&quot;&gt;Pew Research poll&lt;/a&gt; conducted earlier this year, roughly 8 out of 10 Americans surveyed support further development of wind and solar energy, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/06/23/two-thirds-of-americans-think-government-should-do-more-on-climate/&quot;&gt;two-thirds&lt;/a&gt; think the government should do more to address climate change. Another 80 percent of Americans, meanwhile, approve of the idea of creating citizens’ assemblies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Americans always think they’re so different from the rest of the world,” Landemore, who is French, told me. “But we’re all just human beings.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One concern is that, even with support from governments, a group of 150 citizens might not come up with solutions that actually work to combat climate change. Lorraine Whitmarsh, an environmental psychologist at the University of Bath who served as one of the experts for the U.K. assembly, said that the British participants loved “anything informational or educational,” like programs to label the carbon footprint of products or push citizens to eat less beef and pork. Such initiatives are popular — “Who wouldn’t agree with having some labels?” Whitmarsh asked, ruefully —&amp;nbsp;but such piecemeal policies would fall far short of what’s needed to dramatically decrease carbon emissions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s also a concern that assemblies could be too easily influenced, with organizers shaping their recommendations. According to Landemore, the team of experts who designed the French convention had decided that nuclear power shouldn’t be discussed, despite the fact that it provides around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/countries/france&quot;&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the nation’s electricity. Wilson, the deliberative democracy expert, told me that how information about climate change is conveyed to assemblies — as a problem to be managed or as a stark, existential emergency — could affect whether the assemblies propose huge, society-altering changes such as a ban on coal power, or just policy tweaks, like extra recycling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;In July, both houses of the French Parliament passed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/20/world/europe/france-climate-law.html&quot;&gt;country’s new climate law&lt;/a&gt;. It was inspired by the work of the convention, but only loosely. According to an analysis by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.francetvinfo.fr/monde/environnement/convention-citoyenne-sur-le-climat/infographie-le-projet-de-loi-climat-et-resilience-ne-reprend-que-10propositions-de-la-convention-citoyenne-sans-filtre_4309153.html&quot;&gt;FranceInfo&lt;/a&gt;, only 10 of the convention’s proposals made it into the law in truly “unfiltered” versions; 36 others were included, but in weakened form.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Some of the measures were there, but not of the intensity we wanted,” Roggeman said. “It was always like, ‘Oh, we’re postponing the dates,’ or ‘Oh yes, we’ll forbid cars of a certain weight’ — but not the weight we asked for.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image alignfull js-breaks-column&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-fancy-room.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-fancy-room.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-fancy-room.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-fancy-room.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-fancy-room.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-fancy-room.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-fancy-room.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/citizens-assembly-fancy-room.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;a gilded room with giant chandelier and long tables with people sitting at them discussing&quot; data-caption=&quot;French Ecological Transition Minister Barbara Pompili, French Prime Minister Jean Castex, and French Junior Minister of Relations with the Parliament Marc Fesneau, attend a meeting with the representatives of the Citizens’ Convention for Climate in Paris, on September 30, 2020.

&lt;p&gt;As the law was being drafted, members of the assembly were often angry, frustrated by what they saw as the failure of Macron to follow through on his promises. The convention met again in February, this time to give the government a score (out of 10) on how well it had implemented their proposals thus far: The average vote was 2.5.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But by late spring, as the bill made its way through the National Assembly and the Senate, tempers cooled and the group began to look at it with pride. While many of the proposals had been watered down, the final legislation was still one of the most comprehensive climate laws France had passed in years. It banned some short-haul domestic flights, ordered a phaseout of advertising for fossil fuels and gasoline, and incentivized electric car and bike purchases. Some of the measures most beloved by the citizens were left on the cutting-room floor. But it was hard to imagine that the law, in its final form, could have existed without the convention’s nine months of work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When I spoke to Burquier on the phone in May, shortly after the law had passed through the National Assembly, he sounded invigorated, even happy. Although the final law was “very different” from what the convention had hoped for, he said, “Tonight, we can be very proud.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Roggeman agreed. “I don’t want to see myself as disappointed,” she told me. “I feel lucky — lucky to have had this incredible citizen experience in my life.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the two years since they first met, the members of the convention have seen their lives fundamentally changed. Roggeman has spoken about her experiences at a conference at Yale University and recently traveled to the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow. Former members have even formed a new organization, which they call &lt;em&gt;Les Cent-cinquante &lt;/em&gt;(“The 150”), and continue to lobby the government to enact their proposals. One citizen, Grégoire Fraty, has written &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Moi-citoyen-Laventure-Convention-lint%C3%A9rieur/dp/2412065470&quot;&gt;a book&lt;/a&gt; about his experience, calling it an “innovative object” that could change democracy forever.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though he wouldn’t call himself a “militant” about climate change, Burquier’s life has also been transformed. He has met Macron, been on a Zoom call with the mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, and learned to be at ease appearing on French TV. Looking back, he describes the convention as a kind of whirlwind: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.francetvinfo.fr/monde/environnement/convention-citoyenne-sur-le-climat/recit-nous-on-a-fait-notre-boulot-l-experience-de-la-convention-citoyenne-sur-le-climat-racontee-de-l-interieur_4245489.html&quot;&gt;In an interview&lt;/a&gt; with FranceInfo, he likened the experience to being in “a washing machine that shakes hard.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Burquier and other members of The 150 hope climate assemblies spread to other countries, including the U.S. And, he actually believes that they could make it happen. “When Joe Biden was elected, we said, ‘We have to meet the new president of the U.S. and tell him to do a convention,’” he told me. Then he laughed, aware of how self-important the sentence sounded.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s crazy,” he said. “Now we feel we have no limits.”&lt;/p&gt;

Why isn’t it working?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is a collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mercurynews.com/&quot;&gt;The Mercury News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eastbaytimes.com/&quot;&gt;East Bay Times&lt;/a&gt;, whose mission is to&amp;nbsp;inform Bay Area communities by telling accurate and compelling stories that make an impact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;It was the Zoom call from hell.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About a dozen residents from Richmond, a small city in California’s Bay Area, had logged onto the video conferencing application late one June evening last year to discuss improving air quality in their neighborhoods. Tensions were running high. The audio kept cutting out for some who had spotty internet connections. Others struggled to mute and unmute themselves when they wanted to speak. The residents talked over each other, some barely concealing contempt for others on the call. One participant even burst into tears.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Andrés Soto, one of the most vocal community members on the call, watched as the almost two-hour meeting devolved into chaos. A 66-year-old environmental advocate and organizer for the nonprofit Communities for a Better Environment, he was calling from his desk at home in nearby Benicia. The mosaic of family photos framing his head — a cherubic one-year-old Soto smiling cheekily at the camera, a middle-aged Soto in a top hat flanked by his two sons — belied his commanding personality: Born in Berkeley to activist parents, he is a proud Chicano who grew up in Richmond and nearby San Pablo and has spent his adult life joining progressive causes. Most recently he’s been working on issues related to environmental justice. For residents in Richmond, those fights typically center around the 2,900-acre Chevron refinery on the western edge of town, which has paid millions in fines and faced criminal charges for negligence and environmental damages over the last decade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oil behemoth has operated the facility since 1902 and is the largest employer in the working class, heavily industrialized city, making it inextricably tied to the community’s future. Over time, Chevron has donated to more than 80 local organizations, and it even funds a local newspaper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://richmondstandard.com/?s=chevron&quot;&gt;the Richmond Standard&lt;/a&gt;, which features cheery headlines about Chevron’s donations to COVID-19 relief funds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to this largess, the Chevron refinery also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baaqmd.gov/~/media/Files/Planning%20and%20Research/Emission%20Inventory/BY2011_CAPSummary.ashx?la=en&amp;amp;la=en&quot;&gt;belches thousands of pounds&lt;/a&gt; of noxious and carcinogenic gases into Richmond’s air every day. Over the years, residents have had to flee from numerous fires and explosions at the refinery. Six days after Soto started at Communities for Better Environment in 2012, a pipe exploded and the facility caught fire. Soto had just returned from work when his partner told him to look out the window.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I went outside and I saw the big cloud of smoke,” he recalled. His organizer training kicked in, and he immediately sprang into action, calling community members and telling them to stay indoors. He knew the smoke would carry particulate matter and other toxic chemicals that could trigger asthma attacks and worsen respiratory issues. A county health report published months later found that more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://cchealth.org/ems/pdf/Chevron-Richmond-Refinery-Fire-AAR-2012-0806.pdf&quot;&gt;15,000 people sought treatment at a nearby hospital&lt;/a&gt; in the days after the fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sort of repeated exposure to pollution from the refinery and other industrial operations in the community has taken a toll on Richmond’s majority Black, Hispanic, and Asian residents. The city &lt;a href=&quot;https://oehha.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=8dad35dcd2274285874e60871c404edc&quot;&gt;consistently scores among the worst&lt;/a&gt; in the state for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Neighborhoods adjacent to Chevron are in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-30&quot;&gt;99th percentile for asthma rates&lt;/a&gt; in the state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Caps on pollution from the refinery would improve residents’ health, but for years the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecology.iww.org/PDF/misc/Chevron-California-Report-FINAL.pdf&quot;&gt;company’s lobbying efforts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2014/10/31/chevron-money-rains-down-on-richmond-election/&quot;&gt;election-year spending sprees&lt;/a&gt; have scuttled effective monitoring and regulation. Until the 2012 fire, the city had no particulate matter monitors; the closest one, in San Pablo, operated just once every 12 days, often missing times when the refinery spewed more pollutants than it’s allowed to.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the Zoom call, Soto was furious about what he saw as more Chevron meddling. The June 2020 call was part of a series of meetings that Richmond community members had taken up under the aegis of AB 617, a piece of landmark legislation that was passed in 2017 as a companion to the state’s cap-and-trade law. The measure has since funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to 15 low-income communities of color across California — including Richmond — allowing them to install dozens of air monitors, collect air-quality data, and craft plans to place limits on toxic emissions from the refineries and industrial facilities in their neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heralded by lawmakers and academics as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://gspp.berkeley.edu/assets/uploads/page/CEPP_Advancing_Environmental_Justice.pdf&quot;&gt;the new frontier in air quality management&lt;/a&gt;,” the law aimed to put the community in the driver’s seat. No longer would bureaucrats in Sacramento set the agenda. For the first time, state regulators, policymakers, and industry would take instructions from communities on how best to clean up the air.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But more than three years in, AB 617 hasn’t delivered on its promises — and environmental advocates say it doesn’t appear it will. One key reason: There’s no recourse if plans developed under the law don’t actually reduce pollution. Of the 10 communities that were initially selected by state regulators in 2018, just one — Wilmington, a neighborhood that sits by the Port of Los Angeles — initiated a concrete goal to reduce emissions. In at least four other Central and Southern California communities, such as Fresno, Shafter, and East Los Angeles, the plans simply list actions agencies were already going to carry out and meager incentives to cut pollution that do not guarantee concrete emission reductions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a May &lt;a href=&quot;https://caleja.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CEJA_AB617_r4-2.pdf&quot;&gt;report by the California Environmental Justice Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, whose members participated in AB 617 planning in five communities, the process required residents to spend hundreds of hours in meetings, but the resulting plans “are mostly unenforceable, and thus may have little impact to the harmful air they breathe.” The report ends with a stark conclusion that AB 617 “should not be replicated in other jurisdictions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of real emission reductions, AB 617 has created a long-winded, bureaucratic process that looks set to generate reams of new air quality data but little new regulation — as in Richmond, which has so far only approved air quality monitoring that government regulators were already planning on funding. Gwen Ottinger, a researcher at Drexel University who spearheaded an analysis of two years of air-monitoring data in Richmond, said it’s one of the biggest shortcomings of the law. “AB 617 doesn’t cap [emissions],” she said. “It doesn’t draw any lines in the sand.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image alignfull js-breaks-column&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chevron-Richmond-Refinery-2-min.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chevron-Richmond-Refinery-2-min.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chevron-Richmond-Refinery-2-min.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chevron-Richmond-Refinery-2-min.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chevron-Richmond-Refinery-2-min.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chevron-Richmond-Refinery-2-min.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chevron-Richmond-Refinery-2-min.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Chevron-Richmond-Refinery-2-min.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-caption=&quot;Chevron has operated its massive refinery in Richmond since 1902.  &quot; data-credit=&quot;Aric Crabb / Staff / Bay Area News Group&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Chevron has operated its massive refinery in Richmond since 1902.   &lt;cite&gt;Aric Crabb / Staff / Bay Area News Group&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These shortcomings may well be inherent to the bill’s design. Polluting industries’ heavy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/12/12/18090844/california-climate-cap-and-trade-jerry-brown&quot;&gt;influence on California’s cap-and-trade bill&lt;/a&gt; is well-known, but their proposal to include an environmental justice component along the lines of AB 617 has not been widely reported. Indeed, it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/industrycapandtradeproposal.pdf&quot;&gt;one of many ideas floated by a lobbying firm&lt;/a&gt; hired by the oil and gas industry — including Chevron itself — in 2017. Alongside proposals that weakened the proposed cap-and-trade law, the firm suggested creating a “community focused monitoring and control program to address toxic/criteria air pollutants.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The California Air Resources Board, or CARB, is the state agency that selects communities for AB 617 funding and has final approval over their plans. When presented with critiques of the environmental justice law, CARB’s Director of the Office of Community Air Protection, Deldi Reyes, told Grist “it’s way too early to start talking about failures of the program.” She called the AB 617 process “an 11-year commitment” that cannot be fairly judged at the three-year mark. Reyes also said that the agency is “trying to learn from the challenges,” pointing to pollution-mitigating provisions the state has approved after community input, including one cutting emissions from warehouse activities in four Southern California communities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps as a result of this outlook, CARB is moving full speed ahead to expand AB 617 work. The agency has added five more communities to the roster after selecting an initial 10 in 2018. Paulina Torres, an attorney with the Center on Race, Poverty, and the Environment, worries that as more communities across the state are selected, they may pour their time and resources into the process but end up with little to show for it. Given California’s reputation as a climate leader, other states may draw inspiration from AB 617, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I have serious concerns and hesitations,” Torres said. “How did we hop to the next community without addressing the existing failures in the last community?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;Soto was one of several activists in Richmond who was long aware of AB 617’s limitations. He knew there were layers of bureaucracy to wade through, but the work still had the potential to move the needle on pollution in their community. Even small reductions had the potential to save lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s how the process typically unfolds: After being chosen for AB 617 participation by the state, a community first develops an air quality monitoring plan to better understand the sources of its pollution. A group of community members works with the local air district to design the plan, which the district then implements with money allocated through the law. While that plan is being developed or after, the district also selects members for a steering committee that will ultimately craft what the law calls a Community Emissions Reduction Plan. In other words, there are quite a few steps before even a blueprint for reducing pollution is on the table.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Richmond, the district convened a group of residents — called the Community Design Team — to draw up a process to select members for the steering committee. For months, however, that team was bogged down in what many believed should have been an uncontentious topic. Given the history of industry influence in Richmond, the design team was contemplating requiring applicants to fill out a conflict-of-interest form before being considered for the steering committee. The 10-member group was split 6 to 4, with the majority pushing for a strong policy that weeded out residents with ties to Chevron and other industry polluters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image alignfull js-breaks-column&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP050728012852.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP050728012852.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP050728012852.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP050728012852.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP050728012852.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP050728012852.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP050728012852.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP050728012852.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-caption=&quot;A Chevron flag flies at sunset near the Richmond refinery.

&lt;p&gt;The majority, who dubbed themselves the “environmental justice caucus,” consisted of four longtime white residents, Soto, and Naama Raz-Yaseef, an environmental scientist who had recently moved to town. In the minority, however, were all three of the group’s Black members, as well as Oscar Garcia, a Chevron employee. They’d struck a more conciliatory tone on Chevron and were appalled at accusations by a member of the environmental justice caucus that they had “been bought off.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The disturbing thing is that it became a fight between environmental justice and the Black community,” said Raz-Yaseef, a researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. “I still don’t understand how that happened.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As tensions simmered on that June call, Soto and others in the majority pushed for a vote on the conflict-of-interest form. But a representative from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD), the local air district regulating emissions from stationary sources like the Chevron refinery, wouldn’t allow a vote. Instead, the rep wanted to establish a consensus, even as one appeared impossible among members who were barely on speaking terms outside of meetings. That decision, along with others that the district made, would later be deemed part of a “flawed” process by BAAQMD board members who acknowledged that the district had exacerbated “tension and adversity” among community members.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soto, for his part, accused BAAQMD of putting its thumb on the scale to favor industry. After the June call, the district held no design team meetings for the next two months, while the group remained at an impasse over the conflict-of-interest form. The group was finally allowed to vote after the district hired Veronica Eady, a well-respected environmental lawyer, to oversee its equity efforts.

&lt;p&gt;Eady is quick to acknowledge “missteps” the district made last year, but she defended the process’ pace as necessary for crafting an effective plan. “We’ve been trying to move at the speed necessary to really create a deep partnership and a sense of trust and respect between the community and the air district,” she said, emphasizing that the ultimate goal remains tangible improvements in air quality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asked whether he thought Richmond’s air quality would ever improve, Soto demurred: “It depends.” Efforts to monitor air quality in Richmond stretch back to the 1990s, and residents have become accustomed to being asked to participate in air pollution and public health studies. They regularly show up at legislative hearings to advocate for cleaner air. AB 617, he said, was simply the latest time-consuming and expensive ask of the community.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Years of unfulfilled promises have made Soto a cynic in the eyes of some. In his view, he’s a realist. “AB 617 is working exactly as it was designed,” Soto told Grist. “We knew it was going to be a delay tactic.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;Richmond was exactly the sort of community that AB 617 was designed to transform. Incorporated in 1905, the city’s early founders had a dream of making it the “Pittsburgh of the West.” They wooed shipbuilders to its deepwater port, along with auto manufacturers, railroad companies, and others so aggressively that ultimately the city agreed to incentives that left Richmond with a meager tax base to cover basic infrastructure needs. Standard Oil began &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2009/01/15/chevron-beginnings-w-s-rheem/&quot;&gt;building&lt;/a&gt; the massive refinery that eventually became Chevron’s in 1901. The facility became the second-biggest refinery in the world and the city’s largest and most influential employer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the second great migration, economically depressed African Americans from the South began moving to Richmond, lured by the promise of steady work. As a result, Richmond’s population quadrupled between 1940 and 1943. The new residents were relegated to the margins, according to the work of historian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520229204/to-place-our-deeds&quot;&gt;Shirley Ann Wilson Moore&lt;/a&gt;. Restrictive &lt;a href=&quot;https://mappingprejudice.umn.edu/what-are-covenants/&quot;&gt;racial covenants&lt;/a&gt; and discriminatory policies enacted by the local housing authority forced Black residents into crowded, underdeveloped neighborhoods near environmental hazards such as the Chevron refinery and a garbage dump.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the following decades, Richmond residents began connecting the dots between race, industrial pollution, worsening air and water quality, and poor public health — and they began fighting back. Laotian refugees, who began settling in the city after the Vietnam War, joined with Black and Hispanic communities to become a powerful force in Richmond politics from the 1970s on. Headed by three environmental justice organizations — the West County Toxics Coalition, Communities for a Better Environment, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://grist.org/equity/apen-richmond-bay-area-environmental-justice/&quot;&gt;the Asian Pacific Environmental Network&lt;/a&gt; — they established a strong cross-cultural alliance that teamed up to hold Chevron accountable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most recently, the coalition flexed its muscle during the 2014 Richmond city council elections. For years, Chevron had controlled local politics. But after the 2012 fire, sentiment about the company shifted. It had been charged with six misdemeanor counts of violating labor standards and negligently emitting pollutants and agreed to a $2 million fine as part of a plea deal with state and county prosecutors. For the first time in Richmond’s history, the city council also unanimously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/richmond-files-lawsuit-against-chevron-for-alleged-negligence-in-2012-refinery-fire/1950951/&quot;&gt;decided to sue Chevron&lt;/a&gt; for negligence and economic damages to the city. The company responded by pouring more than $3 million into the 2014 city council elections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Chevron’s plan backfired. Years of organizing by coalition members had raised awareness among residents of the many ways in which Chevron’s influence had worked against their interests. All three Chevron-backed council candidates flopped at the ballot box. As Soto put it, “People weren’t buying Chevron’s bullshit anymore.” (Tyler Kruzich, a spokesperson for Chevron, did not respond to specific questions about the company’s conduct in Richmond but said that the company has “a long-standing commitment to reduce emissions at our Richmond facility” and that its recent efforts have led to a reduction in particulate matter emissions.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron’s influence doesn’t end at Richmond’s city limits: It also donates to state legislators, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article229911384.html&quot;&gt;giving&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://calmatters.org/politics/california-election-2020/2020/10/california-lawmakers-big-donors-special-interest-independent-expenditures/&quot;&gt;millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; primarily to conservatives and moderate Democrats. That sort of spending came in handy in 2017, when the California legislature was debating extending its cap-and-trade law, as well as passing AB 617.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the weeks leading up to the passage of those bills, Soto’s Communities for a Better Environment and other grassroots environmental organizations &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huntonnickelreportblog.com/2017/06/bay-area-air-regulators-set-to-adopt-first-of-its-kind-ghg-emissions-cap-on-refineries/&quot;&gt;were on the verge of getting BAAQMD to cap emissions from five refineries in the Bay Area&lt;/a&gt;, including the Chevron facility. BAAQMD had proposed a new regulation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baaqmd.gov/rules-and-compliance/rules/regulation-12-rule-16-petroleum-refining-greenhouse-gas-emissions-limits?sc_lang=vi-VN&amp;amp;switch_lang=true&quot;&gt;called Rule 12-16&lt;/a&gt;, after years of careful study by air district staff, as well as organizing and lobbying by community members. The rule would have required Chevron and other refineries to limit greenhouse gas emissions as well as three other toxic pollutants that are primary drivers of poor respiratory and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Chevron performed an end run around the environmental groups. At the last minute, Chevron and lobbyists with the Western States Petroleum Association, an oil industry trade group, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.capitolwatchdog.org/article/jerry-browns-cap-and-trade-bill-would-exempt-refineries-air-pollution-regulation&quot;&gt;inserted a provision&lt;/a&gt; in the bill to renew California’s cap-and-trade program that stripped local air districts’ authority to directly regulate greenhouse gas emissions. It effectively killed Rule 12-16.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The renewal of cap-and-trade was of paramount importance to then-Governor Jerry Brown. When negotiations on the legislation began in earnest in early 2017, Brown was completing his fourth and final term, and looking to cement his legacy as a climate leader.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When designed properly, cap-and-trade is supposed to limit emissions statewide and slowly ratchet them down, forcing industrial polluters to find ways to cut emissions or shut down altogether. Companies are allowed to purchase pollution credits from a limited pool, and the money raised from the sales is funneled back into community projects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in California, its implementation had been mired in controversy. The state had granted more emission allowances than major polluters needed, and environmental justice advocates warned that the excess pollution would end up hurting communities of color. &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002604#abstract0&quot;&gt;A 2018 study&lt;/a&gt; (co-authored by Grist board member Rachel Morello-Frosch) found that though overall emissions declined statewide, pollution increased in communities of color located close to emitters. The study did not attribute the increase to cap-and-trade, but advocates &lt;a href=&quot;https://grist.org/article/how-california-can-make-its-cap-and-trade-program-more-equitable/&quot;&gt;called it the “I told you so” report&lt;/a&gt; for confirming their fears that the most vulnerable California communities would not benefit from the signature bill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the cap-and-trade bill to pass, it needed support from a two-thirds majority of state legislators. Early versions of the bill were opposed by both Republicans and progressive Democrats — the former because it increased taxes and regulations on business; the latter sided with environmental justice advocates who said that it would not improve air quality in communities like Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The combination of Republican holdouts, the oil industry gunning for fewer limits on carbon emissions, and Brown’s desperation to pass climate legislation of some kind led to the main cap-and-trade bill becoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://inthesetimes.com/article/california-gov-jerry-brown-climate-bill-full-of-giveaways-to-industry&quot;&gt;riddled with giveaways and loopholes&lt;/a&gt;. Killing Rule 12-16 was one such compromise. Others included setting a high cap on emissions and handing &lt;a href=&quot;https://calmatters.org/environment/2017/08/california-climate-deal-net-big-bucks-polluters/&quot;&gt;additional pollution permits&lt;/a&gt; to companies that the state deems are at high risk of moving out of state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even as the main cap-and-trade bill was being watered down, Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia, a Democrat from the Los Angeles area and an environmental justice champion, emerged with an olive branch for advocates like Soto: AB 617. But it, too, was heavily influenced by industry — in fact, the idea to engage disadvantaged communities to come up with air quality solutions came directly from major fossil fuel players. A 12-page &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/industrycapandtradeproposal.pdf&quot;&gt;Powerpoint presentation produced by Latham &amp;amp; Watkins&lt;/a&gt;, a lobbying firm representing Chevron and the larger oil industry, floated the idea along with a wish list for the cap-and-trade bill. In it, lobbyists suggested creating a “community focused monitoring and control program” to address pollutant hotspots with air districts establishing “a community advisory board.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cristina-Garcia-1.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cristina-Garcia-1.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cristina-Garcia-1.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cristina-Garcia-1.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cristina-Garcia-1.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cristina-Garcia-1.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cristina-Garcia-1.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cristina-Garcia-1.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;a woman in glasses and a black jacket talks while pointing. A microphone is pointed at her&quot; data-caption=&quot;Assemblymember Cristina Garcia, a Los Angeles-area Democrat known for her environmental justice work, introduced AB 617 in 2017. &quot; data-credit=&quot;Brittany Murray / Press-Telegram / SCNG&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Assemblymember Cristina Garcia, a Los Angeles-area Democrat known for her environmental justice work, introduced AB 617 in 2017.  &lt;cite&gt;Brittany Murray / Press-Telegram / SCNG&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Garcia, Governor Brown’s office shopped around an early version of AB 617 that had many provisions the oil and gas industry had proposed to her in previous debates. It included money for setting up monitoring systems in disadvantaged communities, but did not have mechanisms to reduce pollution. “I was like, ‘that’s not enough,’” Garcia recalled. “Because the Republicans were at the table, it made it much harder for us to try to get much of anything.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The resulting bill, Garcia admits, was a “compromise” and “a down payment” that she hoped could be improved upon. Since only a small number of communities are picked to participate in AB 617 and funding was limited, it pitted communities against each other over a finite pot of money. Funding for air monitoring and implementing the emission reduction plans is unreliable because it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/4250&quot;&gt;tied to cap-and-trade auction results&lt;/a&gt;. When fewer pollution credits are sold by the state, there’s less money available for communities. Funding for 2019-2020, for example, was revised down from &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/studying-us-to-death-money-racial-woes-tarnish-state-air-law&quot;&gt;$245 million to $209 million&lt;/a&gt; after reduced demand for fossil fuels during the COVID-19 lockdowns. Perhaps most importantly, as Drexel’s Gwen Ottinger noted, the bill lacks strict requirements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AB 617’s early results underscore these shortcomings. In Fresno, the second-most polluted city in the country as measured by year-round particulate pollution, the plan does not have any measurable targets for reducing emissions from heavy-duty vehicles or industrial sources, which are major sources of pollution in the county. Instead, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://community.valleyair.org/media/1516/01finalscfresnocerp-9-19-19.pdf&quot;&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt; expands voluntary rebate programs for swapping older, dirty trucks and cars with electric vehicles and money for residents to replace wood-burning stoves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.valleyair.org/selected-communities/shafter&quot;&gt;plan for Shafter&lt;/a&gt;, a town in the Central Valley that is surrounded by agricultural fields and oil and gas operations, initially did not include any plans to regulate pesticide use, despite community members repeatedly raising the issue as a top priority. After a tough fight with the local air district to consider airborne pesticides a toxic pollutant — and therefore under AB 617 jurisdiction — the community included a pilot program to notify residents of pesticide application schedules. But the county agricultural commissioner has refused to implement the plan, stating that a notification requirement “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/California-Bureau/Kern-DPR-Notification-Pilot-Response.pdf&quot;&gt;is clearly not within the scope of AB 617&lt;/a&gt;.” Other proposals in the Shafter plan include community events to increase awareness about the district’s incentives and car-sharing programs. There are no clear mandates to cut pollution.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Katie Valenzuela, a former policy and political director for the California Environmental Justice Alliance, said that she’d attended numerous meetings where air district staff questioned whether AB 617 even required plans that led to a measurable improvement in air quality. “It kind of makes you go, ‘What?’” she said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Valenzuela said that was a clear misinterpretation of the bill, she laid the blame at the feet of CARB, which she said wasn’t doing enough to hold air districts accountable when they obstructed communities from developing strong plans. CARB oversees local air districts, and all AB 617 community monitoring and emission reductions plans require final approval from the agency’s board. “What we’ve heard time and time again from communities is it’s not meeting the law, and CARB is still approving the plans,” Valenzuela said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Valenzuela, who was heavily involved in cap-and-trade negotiations, said that the state now sees AB 617 as the vehicle to address all environmental justice concerns. When advocates raise the disproportionate effects of a new policy on communities of color, she said that they’re told AB 617 will address it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What was done functionally was exactly what everybody was worried about,” she said. “We’ve made it more complex for communities to advocate.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;AB 617 has delivered tangible results in one aspect: providing state-of-the-art air quality monitoring to vulnerable communities. Richmond provides an illustrative example of that element’s successes — and limits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the massive 2012 fire that led to the political revolt against the Chevron refinery, both Chevron and BAAQMD issued one mantra: The air was safe to breathe. Even as Richmond residents checked into hospitals and clinics in droves, complaining of chest pain and difficulty breathing, the air district reassured the public that the pollutants detected by its monitoring program &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2012/08/10/daniel-borenstein-air-districts-richmond-refinery-fire-statement-incomplete-inaccurate-2/&quot;&gt;were “not a significant health concern.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BAAQMD reached that conclusion based on spotty air-quality data. The monitor closest to the refinery capable of detecting toxic pollutants had been turned off. To save operational costs, the monitor collected data just once every 12 days. As a result, the district relied on samples it collected &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baaqmd.gov/~/media/files/communications-and-outreach/publications/news-releases/2012/2012-033-pmdatamediarelease-82312.pdf?la=en&quot;&gt;more than 24 hours after the fire&lt;/a&gt;, as well as on data from monitors miles away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/refinery-fire-2012-11.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/refinery-fire-2012-11.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/refinery-fire-2012-11.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/refinery-fire-2012-11.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/refinery-fire-2012-11.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/refinery-fire-2012-11.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/refinery-fire-2012-11.jpg?w=1365 1365w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/refinery-fire-2012-11.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/refinery-fire-2012-11.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;a large cloud of smoke from a silhouetted refinery reaches high into the sky partially obscuring the sun&quot; data-caption=&quot;Smoke billows from a crude oil unit at the Chevron refinery in Richmond. &quot; data-credit=&quot;D.

Ross Cameron / Staff Bay Area News Group&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a stark example of inadequate and poorly designed air monitoring — and a key reason why AB 617 funds additional air quality assessment in communities. Other systems across the country are similarly lackluster: A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-pollution-airmonitors-specialreport/special-report-u-s-air-monitors-routinely-miss-pollution-even-refinery-explosions-idUSKBN28B4RT&quot;&gt;bombshell Reuters investigation&lt;/a&gt; last year found that the nation’s air monitors, which are routinely used to determine local air quality — and relied upon by those with respiratory diseases — are routinely failing to pick up spikes in pollution from fires and explosions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-21-38&quot;&gt;A report by the Government Accountability Office&lt;/a&gt;, Congress’ investigative arm, published late last year found that funding for state and local monitoring has decreased by 20 percent since 2004.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the 2012 fire, Chevron paid to have an air-quality monitoring company install and run six sets of monitors in Richmond, but because they were operated by Chevron’s contractor, the air district couldn’t&lt;a href=&quot;https://richmondconfidential.org/2013/09/27/chevron-installs-new-air-monitor-in-north-richmond/&quot;&gt; use the data&lt;/a&gt; from them to impose fines or penalties. What’s more, as Ottinger, the Drexel University researcher, discovered, the contractor posted the air monitor readings on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://fenceline.org/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; where they were voluminous, difficult to decipher, and disappeared into a virtual black hole with each new batch of data posted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AB 617 is supposed to rectify these data gaps. As part of the law’s implementation in Richmond, CARB and the local air district have sponsored two groups of nonprofits, which have installed more than 100 small monitors outside residents’ homes and near childcare centers and schools in Richmond and neighboring San Pablo. Every minute, the shoebox-sized devices measure the levels of particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone — three of the most harmful pollutants to human health. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://insights.aclima.io/&quot;&gt;third company&lt;/a&gt; that has fitted cars with air monitors has been driving around Richmond to collect even more detailed, block-level data. Analysis of the data so far has led the community to identify two pollution hotspots near industrial facilities and major highways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image alignfull js-breaks-column&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/air-monitor-richmond.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/air-monitor-richmond.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/air-monitor-richmond.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/air-monitor-richmond.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/air-monitor-richmond.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/air-monitor-richmond.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/air-monitor-richmond.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/air-monitor-richmond.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-caption=&quot;A solar-powered air-quality monitor hangs on a light pole at Richmond’s Lucas Park. &quot; data-credit=&quot;Jane Tyska / Bay Area News Group&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A solar-powered air-quality monitor hangs on a light pole at Richmond’s Lucas Park.  &lt;cite&gt;Jane Tyska / Bay Area News Group&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, a key question — whether these findings will ever be used to develop regulations that cut emissions — still looms large over the process. The AB 617 process is generating useful data, yet Richmond &lt;a href=&quot;https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/community-air-protection-program/communities/south-sacramento-florin&quot;&gt;remains one of just two&lt;/a&gt; communities of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/community-air-protection-program/community-selection/2018-community-selection-0&quot;&gt;the 10 selected to receive funding from the law&lt;/a&gt; that doesn’t yet have an emissions reduction plan. Soto and others believe that’s at least in part due to corporate influence over the process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2019, a group of 35 residents and representatives of various polluting companies, including Chevron and the nearby Levin coal terminal, were selected to approve an air monitoring plan under the aegis of AB 617. A few months after the group was formed, it was given the chance to begin work on an emissions-reductions plan. Instead, the group voted to continue air monitoring work. It was a delay that would leave Richmond residents breathing polluted air for another year. When the group finally concluded its work in July 2020, it had little to show for the previous year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re generating more and more and more ambient air data, especially at the community level, without the same kind of attention being put into: ‘So then what do you do with that data?’” said Ottinger, the Drexel University professor. “Does it change anything?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We know Chevron is the single largest emitter of &lt;span class=&quot;tooltipsall tooltipsincontent classtoolTips1&quot;&gt;greenhouse gases&lt;/span&gt; in Northern California,” said Soto. “We don’t need to have a fully completed portrait of the pollution in Richmond to know that we need to do something to drastically reduce the pollution coming from Chevron. That’s our frustration.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;In December, six months after the disastrous June Zoom call, the Richmond residents were no closer to finding common ground. If anything, the group’s divisions had grown deeper. Oscar Garcia, one of the ten Richmond residents on the call, dropped a bombshell that led to further polarization. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21062923-cerp-dt-protest-letter-dec-2020-1&quot;&gt;three-page letter&lt;/a&gt; to state legislators signed by him and three other Richmond neighborhood council presidents, he accused Soto and five other participants on the call — the so-called “EJ caucus” — of racial bias and “systematic disenfranchisement of Black and Brown communities.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Garcia, who was born and raised in the Iron Triangle, a residential area adjacent to the Chevron refinery, is president of the neighborhood council and has been active in the city’s politics. He ran for a seat on Richmond’s city council and now serves on its Community Police Review Commission. For the past nine years, he has also worked at Chevron’s headquarters in San Ramon and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/oscar-garcia-239b5224/&quot;&gt;in charge of coordinating compliance with California’s cap-and-trade program&lt;/a&gt; at the Richmond refinery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Soto and others in the EJ caucus, Garcia is the walking embodiment of the conflict of interest that they were trying to root out. They had seen once already how Chevron and other polluting industries had delayed AB 617 work on the air monitoring committee and were determined to not let history repeat itself when choosing the steering committee that would draft an emissions reductions plan. (Garcia did not respond to multiple requests for comment; Kruzich, the Chevron spokesperson, said that participation by employees representing community perspectives “is independent of any Chevron participation in the AB 617 process.”)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For many Richmond residents who are clamoring for something to be done about the Chevron plant, Garcia may always be perceived as biased. Someone like Willie Robinson, on the other hand, is harder to peg. Robinson is the president of the Richmond chapter of the NAACP, which has received tens of thousands of dollars in donations from Chevron. He routinely sided with Garcia and is one of the three Black members of the group that Garcia referenced in his December letter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Willie-Robinson-3-min.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Willie-Robinson-3-min.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Willie-Robinson-3-min.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Willie-Robinson-3-min.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Willie-Robinson-3-min.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Willie-Robinson-3-min.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Willie-Robinson-3-min.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Willie-Robinson-3-min.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-caption=&quot;Willie Robinson, the president of the Richmond branch of the NAACP, doesn’t believe that Chevron’s donations to his organization compromise his concerns for the health of his community. &quot; data-credit=&quot;Anda Chu / Bay Area News Group&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Willie Robinson, the president of the Richmond branch of the NAACP, doesn’t believe that Chevron’s donations to his organization compromise his concerns for the health of his community.  &lt;cite&gt;Anda Chu / Bay Area News Group&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A longtime resident of Richmond, Robinson is appalled that Soto and others question his commitment to his community. “If Chevron gave us a few thousand dollars for a fundraiser in February, I’m going to be beholden to Chevron when it comes to my air?” Robinson said in an interview with Grist. “The peanuts that Chevron puts in this community don’t amount to nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Robinson doesn’t want to see Chevron or any other company shutter in a city desperate for tax revenue and economic activity. “What would be a measured way to get them to change without necessarily forcing them out of business?” he asked rhetorically.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result of Garcia’s letter, Veronica Eady, the air district lawyer who had intervened once already over the summer to break the impasse over the conflict-of-interest form, was called in to settle the dispute in mid-December. Over the course of more than three hours, the community members described a year of division and chaos. Garcia implored the air district to promote a consensus-based approach to choosing steering committee members, to prevent the EJ caucus from using its majority to dominate the process. Randy Joseph, a Black resident who currently serves on the city’s police task force, said that he was “hurt” that the EJ caucus regularly met separately to strategize. Soto struck a conciliatory note, saying, “We want to work with the fellow members of the design team.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By the end of the meeting, air district board members began apologizing for how their decisions derailed the AB 617 process. But the next step they took promised to slow the process even more: In order to prevent independent meetings like those the EJ caucus was accused of, the board voted to give the steering committee a legal designation that makes its meetings open to the public and more transparent. Regardless of the decision’s merits, it adds another layer of bureaucracy for community members to navigate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Richmond is running out of time. The official deadline to have a plan in place is February 2022. The division over the conflict-of-interest form and mismanagement by the district meant the committee to design the plan wasn’t even in place &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baaqmd.gov/~/media/files/communications-and-outreach/publications/news-releases/2021/richmondsc_210308_2021_008-pdf.pdf?la=en&quot;&gt;until this past March&lt;/a&gt;. The 30-member committee is unlikely to finalize a plan in the four months before the 2022 deadline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, the committee has met seven times, discussed its responsibilities under AB 617, and selected co-chairs to lead the process. Substantive work on ways to improve air quality in Richmond has not begun.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eady said that CARB would likely grant an extension to Richmond, just as it has to other communities bogged down in the logistics of AB 617. She said it was “pretty remarkable” that the community had established “a very functional steering committee” after all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Soto is watching from the sidelines. The air district has prohibited him, Garcia, and the remaining members of the community design team from joining the emissions reductions committee. But he’s more hopeful now. Eady and her air district colleagues are “turning lemons into lemonade the best they can,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soto maintains, however, that the air district has the authority to require more stringent emission caps on Chevron and other polluters. The AB 617 process is just an excuse not to use it, in his view: “Air districts already have profound authority to regulate pollutants and have chosen not to.”&lt;/p&gt;

A year after the incident, the Black cyclist told the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chicagoreader.com/columns-opinion/cops-slammed-for-ticketing-black-cyclists-its-about-the-police-harassing-people/&quot;&gt;Chicago Reader&lt;/a&gt;, he briefly dipped onto the sidewalk to avoid potholes while riding on the West Side of Chicago, in between the predominantly Latino neighborhood of Garfield Park and the predominantly Black neighborhood of North Lawndale. The police didn’t care that he was just trying to prevent a crash and tumble at the fault of a crumbling road. He was fined $50 anyway.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Harris’s experience at the time was a norm, part of a larger policing strategy in the city of Chicago called “stop and frisk.” The strategy was used to stop people for petty grievances, such as riding their bike on the sidewalk, in hopes it would lead to bigger arrests such as drug or gun possession.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Chicago Tribune &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-chicago-bike-tickets-minorities-0319-20170317-story.html&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that between 2008 and 2016, each of the top ten neighborhoods where cyclists were ticketed at the highest rates were either majority Black or Latino. During that period, bike riders in Black neighborhoods were ticketed twice as much as cyclists in white neighborhoods. But in 2016, shortly after the American Civil Liberties Union, or ACLU, released a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu-il.org/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ACLU_StopandFrisk_6.pdf&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on the practice, the ACLU and the Chicago Police Department, or CPD, reached a settlement agreement to reform the practice of investigatory street stops. In return, ticketing for bike riders across the city declined by 64 percent by the end of 2019.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the racial disparities in ticketing only got worse. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920921003254&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; authored by University of California assistant professor Jesus Barajas has found that from 2017 to 2019, bicyclists riding in Chicago’s Black neighborhoods were eight times more likely to be ticketed by police than those riding in white neighborhoods. More than 90 percent of those tickets were issued for riding on the sidewalk, something that is hard to navigate on the South and West Sides of Chicago where a majority of the city’s communities of color are found. It’s where bike infrastructure — protected bike lanes, well-maintained streets, and painted roads — are sparse, making the climate-friendly mode of transportation life-endangering for more reasons than one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To Barajas, whose research focuses on mobility justice and transportation equity, Chicago shows how a lack of infrastructure contributes to the over-policing of Black and brown communities, proving a connection between government planning and systemic racism.“If you’re riding on the sidewalk, it’s simple,” he said It’s quite likely because you don’t feel safe on the street.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The connections between race, policing, and infrastructure illuminate a deeply unjust trend in Chicago — and they have serious implications on the environment. “You can give me any injustice that Black folks are facing and I would trace it back to structural racism,” Oboi Reed, founder of the West Side justice organization Equiticity, told Grist. “In Chicago, Black communities are facing multi-generational sustained disinvestments and it’s impacting every single one of our life and health outcomes.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new analysis, which Equicity consulted on, found that on average, Chicago’s white neighborhoods have 50 percent more bike lanes than Black neighborhoods. So, as Black riders, who are less likely to be protected on the streets, move to ride on the sidewalk, their likelihood for a police interaction exponentially increases. The disparities are then intensified when the police arrive. Chicago’s white and Black populations are nearly identical in size at 33 percent and 30 percent respectively, yet 75 percent of the people arrested and &lt;a href=&quot;https://grist.org/equity/toxic-jails-environmental-justice-los-angeles-new-york-chicago/&quot;&gt;jailed in Chicago&lt;/a&gt; are Black. White people make up just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cookcountysheriff.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CCSO_BIU_CommunicationsCCDOC_v1_2021_10_18.pdf&quot;&gt;7.5 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the city’s jail population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s obvious to see then, Barajas says, that “the city’s traffic plan, Vision Zero, contributes to compounding inequities. A lack of infrastructure leads to additional policing in neighborhoods that are already over policed.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This also means people in Black communities are less likely to be able to openly access their environment — and the city loses its climate-friendly impacts as a result. Riding bicycles increases &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/benefits-of-cycling&quot;&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt;, improves &lt;a href=&quot;https://mensline.org.au/mens-mental-health/cycling-the-exercise-for-positive-mental-health/&quot;&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;, improves &lt;a href=&quot;http://cleanair-stlouis.com/the-air-quality-benefits-of-biking/&quot;&gt;air quality&lt;/a&gt;, and reduces levels of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bicycling.com/news/a23707702/climate-change-cycling/&quot;&gt;greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-31/switching-from-cars-to-bikes-cuts-commuting-emissions-by-67?sref=wINQCNXe&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that choosing a bike over a car just once a day reduces an average citizen’s carbon emissions from transport by 67 percent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1235852815.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1235852815.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1235852815.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1235852815.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1235852815.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1235852815.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1235852815.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1235852815.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;A man rides his bicycle in a bike lane&quot; data-caption=&quot;A cyclist is seen in a bike lane on Logan Boulevard east of Western Avenue in Chicago on Oct. 4, 2021.

&lt;p&gt;To make things worse, the study found that the city’s priorities did not even make the streets safer. During the study’s three-year period, bikers in white neighborhoods were 3 times more likely to experience serious or fatal bike crashes. Barajas hypothesizes that this is because white neighborhoods have higher levels of bike traffic, but it also shows enforcement isn’t based on crashes or high numbers of riders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This, Reed says, is the most poignant evidence against the effectiveness of enforcement. “We are asking enforcement to fix a problem that the transportation and planning sector created,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both Reed and Barajas are calling for a holistic approach to tackling the inequities around biking in Chicago. A simple solution they’ve found is adding bike lanes. In Chicago, between 2017 and 2019, 85 percent fewer tickets were given out and crashes declined on streets that had bike lanes. There’s also proof that bike lanes encourage new riders to take the streets. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/15/e2024399118&quot;&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that in cities where bike infrastructure was added, cycling increased up to 48 percent more than in cities that did not add bike lanes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a way to tackle safety challenges in biking, while also addressing major environmental justice problems in cities like Chicago, they contend. For years, Reed’s Equiticity has worked to build a cycling culture on the city’s West Side through programming and research. Riding a bike, Reeds says, both betters the environment and people’s health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Barajas’ research, he says, proves that urban infrastructure investments lead to improved living experiences for vulnerable people. “Buildings — we can’t move them — but we can reconfigure the streets,” he said.

Here’s how that affects Indigenous water rights</title><description>&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;As a child, Preston J. Arrow-weed lived near a stretch of the Colorado River that traced a wide, sweeping curve through the Fort Yuma-Quechan Reservation, which straddles the border of California and Arizona. The tribal elder recalls the way the river would swell during certain seasons, as rain or runoff upriver would send sediment-laden water coursing through the channel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The water was so swift, and when it first came it would be sandy and brown, then after it settled it became blue,” said Arrow-weed, 81, a singer, actor, and playwright who is a member of the Quechan Indian Tribe. “We used to get a bucket of water from the river and take it home. Then, when it settled, we’d drink it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the once-wild river flows mechanically into a concrete canal that diverts most of the streamflow toward distant lettuce fields in California’s Imperial Valley before it reaches the reservation. Flowing downstream from the reservation, the river usually dries up before it crosses the U.S.-Mexico border, 15 miles south of Yuma, Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The changes Arrow-weed has witnessed during his eight decades on the river may have seemed gradual, but now, after years of decline, the once-mighty waterway is a sliver of its former self.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s about 20 feet wide at the most,” he said. “You can walk across it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Colorado River Basin encompasses seven U.S. states and supplies water to 40 million people. Over the past two decades, the basin has experienced record-setting heat and some of the driest years ever recorded, which have combined to sap the river of water at unprecedented rates. The largest reservoirs on the river have dropped to alarmingly low levels in recent months, forcing Western water managers to rethink how they operate in the face of scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last month, federal officials sounded the alarm by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/16/climate/colorado-river-water-cuts.html&quot;&gt;declaring the first-ever water shortage&lt;/a&gt; in the basin. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation cited “historic drought,” climate change, and low levels of runoff from the Rocky Mountains as reasons for the continued decline of Lake Mead, the massive reservoir near Las Vegas held back by the Hoover Dam. Lake Mead’s stores are used by millions of people in the lower half of the basin, while serving as a critical safeguard against drought-related shortages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lake Mead is considered full when its stores reach 1,220 feet above sea level or more, but the reservoir is projected to sink to 1,066 feet above sea level by the end of the year, revealing rock that has been submerged since it began filling in the 1930s. With every foot that Lake Mead falls, the basin comes closer to triggering substantial cutbacks for certain water users along the river. The first round of reductions, which will take effect next year, will primarily impact farmers in central Arizona. But if lake levels continue to decline, future cutbacks could impact the 30 Native American tribes with lands in the basin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indigenous nations have recognized rights to more than one-fifth of the basin’s annual supply — more than a trillion gallons, or nearly enough to cover an area the size of Connecticut in a foot of water. That allocation is likely to increase in the future, because 12 of the tribes in the Colorado River Basin are still engaged in the decades-long process of resolving their water rights claims, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.naturalresourcespolicy.org/projects/water-tribes-colorado-river-basin/&quot;&gt;Water &amp;amp; Tribes Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, a coalition of tribal representatives, water rights attorneys and academics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tribal water rights differ from state-based rights in several ways. Unlike a state or irrigation district, a tribe’s right to water dates back at least as early as the creation of its reservation. Despite having federally reserved water rights, tribal claims were largely ignored until the 1960s, when the U.S. Supreme Court adopted standards allowing tribes to have their rights quantified, a form of legal recognition &lt;a href=&quot;https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R44148.pdf&quot;&gt;that identifies the amount of water to which users hold rights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But even for tribes that have resolved their rights, some face significant barriers to fully using their water, including a lack of necessary infrastructure, funding challenges, and limited legal options to put their water to use outside their reservations through leases or other arrangements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If a tribe does not (or cannot) use all the water it is entitled to, it doesn’t go unused; thirsty cities and agricultural fields downstream from reservations siphon off the surplus, but with no compensation for the tribe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The basin is free-riding off of undeveloped tribal water rights,” said Jay Weiner, an attorney for the Quechan Indian Tribe. Weiner said there is a “fundamental tension” between tribes’ desire to fully develop their water rights and the overarching need for everyone in the basin to consume less water overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tribes with substantial diversion rights may remain unscathed by the initial reductions, with some even in the position to contribute water back into the system. But other tribes are less fortunate; in addition to unrecognized water rights, deteriorating infrastructure, and water insecurity issues, some tribes could face cutbacks to their water supply as early as 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether a tribe is flush with mainstream flows or struggling to access clean drinking water, every tribe in the basin must navigate the complicated legal landscape that governs water rights on the Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;Much of the water that flows through the Colorado River starts as snowpack in the southern Rockies. The snowmelt produced in spring then flows into tributaries in states like Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado. These states are part of the Upper Colorado River Basin: The lands fed by waters of the Colorado River system were divided into an upper basin and a lower basin during the negotiations for the 1922 Colorado River Compact. The so-called “law of the river” is an amalgamation of interstate compacts, statutes, regulations, court decisions, an international treaty, and the seminal 1964 &lt;a href=&quot;https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/373/546/&quot;&gt;U.S. Supreme Court decree&lt;/a&gt; in Arizona v. California, which enabled several tribes to quantify their rights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Utah, one of those tributaries — the Green River — flows through the lands of the Ute Indian Tribe, which had a portion of its water rights quantified in the 1920s but is still litigating unresolved claims. Because the Ute tribe has not fully resolved nor developed those rights, much of the tribe’s water goes unused and flows toward Lake Powell, the second-largest reservoir on the Colorado River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the declining water levels at the lake, the state of Utah is forging ahead with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2021/06/13/lake-powell-pipeline/&quot;&gt;a proposed $2 billion pipeline that would pump water from Lake Powell&lt;/a&gt; to largely non-Native communities near St. George — 140 miles away, in southwestern Utah. Critics &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2020/09/09/surrounding-states-bash/&quot;&gt;blasted the proposal&lt;/a&gt;, citing the state’s failure to recognize the tribe’s water entitlements, its refusal to conduct meaningful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kuer.org/indian-country/2020-07-09/lake-powell-pipeline-route-runs-through-sacred-land-says-southern-paiute-tribe&quot;&gt;tribal consultation&lt;/a&gt; and, more generally, its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eenews.net/articles/as-the-west-bakes-utah-forges-ahead-with-water-pipeline/&quot;&gt;antiquated approach to water development&lt;/a&gt; in the Western U.S.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Ute Indian Tribe has a pending lawsuit challenging the project, arguing that the pipeline would obstruct the tribe’s efforts to fully develop its water rights. (The Ute Indian Tribe declined a request to be interviewed for this article, citing the ongoing litigation.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For over a century, the State of Utah has pursued a deliberate policy of interfering with and preventing the Ute Indian Tribe from exercising its federal Indian reserved water rights,” wrote members of the Ute Indian Tribe Business Committee in a statement released in July. “The Lake Powell Pipeline is another chapter in this saga.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battling for water rights is more than just a struggle for adequate water resources; it’s a fight for better health.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tribes with unresolved water rights must undertake a convoluted settlement process to have their share of the river quantified. And while every tribe is legally entitled to enough water to satisfy their on-reservation needs, having unquantified rights poses &lt;a href=&quot;https://grist.org/politics/why-hope-might-be-on-the-horizon-for-western-tribes-water-woes/&quot;&gt;additional challenges&lt;/a&gt; for those tribes, according to Bidtah Becker, an associate attorney with the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Navajo Nation has extensive water rights in both the upper and lower basins, but the tribe’s claims in the state of Arizona remain unquantified. Proposed settlements negotiated by the tribe a decade ago never materialized. In the coming years, court proceedings are scheduled to resolve the water rights of the Navajo, as well as the neighboring Hopi Tribe. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Becker said tribes without recognized water rights often face challenges in securing funding for water infrastructure projects, especially in areas where substantial water pipelines and other facilities would be required. The lack of adequate water infrastructure has long plagued the Navajo Nation, where residents are 67 times more likely than other Americans to live &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.naturalresourcespolicy.org/docs/water-tribes/wti-executive-summary-4.2021.pdf&quot;&gt;without access to running water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image alignfull js-breaks-column&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1154271970.jpg&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1154271970.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1154271970.jpg?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1154271970.jpg?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1154271970.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1154271970.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1154271970.jpg?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1154271970.jpg 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-caption=&quot;A member of the Navajo Nation fills a water tank. &quot; data-credit=&quot;Spencer Platt/Getty Images&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A member of the Navajo Nation fills a water tank.  &lt;cite&gt;Spencer Platt/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those inequities were further exposed when COVID-19 spread into the Navajo Nation, Becker said. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341528150_American_Indian_Reservations_and_COVID-19_Correlates_of_Early_Infection_Rates_in_the_Pandemic&quot;&gt;study published last year&lt;/a&gt; showed a strong association between COVID-19 infection rates and the lack of indoor plumbing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As tribes with unresolved rights fight to settle their claims, the basin-wide shortage is forcing all stakeholders on the river to find ways to conserve water. That scarcity is likely to make striking a deal even more challenging than it has been in the past.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It makes a hard process harder,” said Pam Adams, Native American affairs program manager for the Bureau of Reclamation’s Lower Colorado Basin region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adams is one of the chief liaisons between the tribes and Reclamation, an agency under the Department of the Interior. Acknowledging the persistent challenges faced by tribes seeking settlements in the past, Adams said resolving all outstanding tribal claims is a priority among the department’s leaders, including Interior Secretary &lt;a href=&quot;https://grist.org/agriculture/indigenous-water-rights/&quot;&gt;Deb Haaland&lt;/a&gt;, who is a member of the Laguna Pueblo. Clarifying the rights of each tribe also gives greater certainty to other stakeholders in the basin, Adams said, adding, “It’s best for everyone to get them settled and this administration is certainly very supportive of that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Bureau of Reclamation is currently building &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usbr.gov/projects/index.php?id=580&quot;&gt;a 300-mile-long pipeline&lt;/a&gt; that will supply water from the San Juan River to portions of the Navajo Nation and Jicarilla Apache Nation. Becker said projects like the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project are significant steps, but that more needs to be done to address the lack of water security in Native American communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mygilariver.com/&quot;&gt;Gila River Indian Community&lt;/a&gt;, or GRIC, irrigate thousands of acres south of Phoenix. With a population of more than 13,000 living on the reservation, the tribe traces its roots to ancient cultures that built expansive networks of irrigation canals to support large villages along the waterway. These days, the farmlands are fed by a new stream. The Central Arizona Project, or CAP, completed in the 1990s, is a 330-mile-long canal that conveys Colorado River water from Lake Havasu, on the California border, to central and southern Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Because the CAP has some of the lowest-priority rights on the river, the canal is subject to the first round of reductions next year. The basin-wide Drought Contingency Plan established a three-tiered system for imposing reductions in the lower basin based on the level of Lake Mead. Under a Tier 1 shortage (which is triggered when the elevation of Lake Mead falls below 1,075 feet), CAP water supplies will be cut by 30 percent — reductions that will primarily impact farmers in places like Pinal County.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The five tribes that draw from the CAP have some of the highest-priority rights on the canal, which largely buffers them from the initial round of cutbacks. If Lake Mead were to fall below 1,025 feet in elevation, the lower basin would enter a Tier 3 shortage, at which point Arizona’s diversion rights would be reduced by roughly 45 percent compared to the canal’s current supply.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we get to Tier 3, all the tribes that rely on CAP water have the risk of a reduction,” said Chuck Cullom, Colorado River programs manager for the CAP.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even if continued declines were to trigger a Tier 3 shortage — the direst scenario envisioned in the 2019 Drought Contingency Plan — water deliveries to the Gila River Indian Community would be largely the same, according to Jason Hauter, a tribal member who represents the GRIC as an attorney.&lt;/p&gt;

Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There would be cuts, but in terms of the community’s on-reservation use, they’d have water available to them under a Tier 3 shortage scenario,” Hauter said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But a Tier 3 shortage is far from the worst-case scenario, because declining streamflows could push the level of Lake Mead below the 1,025-foot mark — a situation left unaddressed by the Drought Contingency Plan. While the chances of Lake Mead reaching critically low levels seemed remote when planning efforts began, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usbr.gov/newsroom/#/news-release/3994&quot;&gt;projections released by Reclamation&lt;/a&gt; last month indicate there is a 66 percent chance the reservoir falls below 1,025 feet by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Falling below that level would trigger additional cutbacks, which would likely include curtailing tribal water deliveries from the CAP. And, because tribes on the CAP are allowed to lease their water rights directly to municipalities, future reductions to tribal water could also impact the water-supply holdings of cities and towns throughout central Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If Lake Mead were to fall below 900 feet, it would elicit the disaster scenario known as “dead pool,” in which water would no longer flow through Hoover Dam, cutting off the lower basin and shutting down a hydroelectric plant that provides electricity for millions of people in the Southwest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stephen Roe Lewis, governor of the Gila River Indian Community, said via email that the tribe is committed to working with other stakeholders in the basin to avoid that fate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, as hydrological conditions in the basin continue to worsen, deeper cuts seem inevitable. Reclamation’s Phoenix Area Office manager Leslie Meyers said next year’s reductions will have a minimal impact on tribal water supplies, but warned, “That won’t be the case in the future if we continue down this path.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;For thousands of years before the first concrete dams were built on the Colorado, the Mojave people — or AhaMacav, which means “people of the river” — maintained large settlements on either side of the surging stream. In 1865, the U.S. government lumped members of the Mojave and Chemehuevi tribes together to form the Colorado River Indian Tribes, or CRIT, which later came to include Navajo and Hopi families.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CRIT’s water rights were quantified as part of Arizona v. California, the series of U.S. Supreme Court cases beginning in the 1930s that dealt with water disputes between the two states. Along with confirming the rights of the five mainstream tribes in the lower basin, the case also established the standard of determining tribal entitlements based on a tribe’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1918&amp;amp;context=nrj&quot;&gt;practicably irrigable acreage&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tribe’s history of agriculture, including an 80,000-acre irrigation project built by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, enabled the CRIT to secure annual diversion rights of more than 700,000 acre-feet, the largest entitlement of any tribe in the basin. Although the CRIT uses a large portion of its water for farming and agriculture, much of its entitlements in both Arizona and California go unused — a fortunate fact for farmers in central Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tribe has employed a number of creative approaches to generate revenue using its reserved water rights, including discontinuing certain existing water uses on tribal land, and using the water that is conserved to prop up levels in Lake Mead.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;p&gt;Water flows through infrastructure at CRIT Farms, located near Parker, Arizona, in the lower basin of the Colorado River. Images courtesy of CRIT Farms.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The tribe has agreed to fallow a portion of its historically irrigated farmland over the next three years, conserving a total of 150,000 acre-feet of water that will be left in Lake Mead. For its help in minimizing cutbacks for lower-priority users — such as agriculture served by the CAP — the tribe is receiving $38 million, mostly from the state of Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Margaret Vick, an attorney for the CRIT, said that although the tribe is well-positioned to contribute conservation water, its ability to benefit from other types of off-reservation uses are limited. Unlike tribes with water settlements, she said, the CRIT’s decreed water rights generally prohibit the tribe from directly leasing its water to off-reservation users. The tribe proposed federal legislation last year that would allow it to market some of its Arizona allocation, but the bill hasn’t been introduced in Congress, Vick said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the CRIT’s water rights are quantified and it has enough water to contribute to Mead, the tribe has historically suffered from a lack of funding for necessary infrastructure — something that is often negotiated as part of a water settlement, Vick said. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/programs/crbstudy/tribalwaterstudy.html&quot;&gt;Tribal Water Study&lt;/a&gt;, parts of the federal irrigation project were built in the late 1800s, and suffer from “design limitations and simple aging problems,” such as unlined canals and deteriorating gates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Weiner, the attorney for the Quechan tribe, said that while each tribe is in a different situation, they generally agree on the need for more flexibility in the legal framework that governs the river.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Tribes can coalesce around the importance of flexible tools and finding ways to allow tribes to benefit from their water resources,” Weiner said. “On-reservation development is certainly one of those ways, but things like off-reservation transfers and system conservation programs are other ways that tribes could potentially benefit from their water resources without necessarily having to add new consumptive demands to the system.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges facing tribes in the basin, tribal leaders and water managers see opportunities for solutions that would help alleviate some of the water-supply pressures on non-Native stakeholders while enabling the tribes to benefit from their water. And, regardless of the water management decisions that are made going forward, the tribes want a seat at the table.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tribal leaders often lament the lack of tribal consultation that occurs when federal or state governments make decisions that impact tribal resources. Secretary Haaland has emphasized the importance of tribal engagement during her time leading the Interior Department, but the level of tribal involvement in the basin’s next round of drought planning remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Noting the importance of cooperation between basin stakeholders, Becker, the attorney for the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority, said the ongoing shortage should also serve as a reminder that water is not simply a commodity, but a vital substance on which our survival depends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve created these systems where people pay money and they get a service,” Becker said. “But maybe what Mother Nature is saying to us is that, when it comes to something like water, we need to shift our approach so that people understand exactly where their water is coming from, and understand their role in protecting the most precious resource we have.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Merricks’ ranch-style home, with most of Jesse’s childhood stuff in it, burned down that day. A week after the fire, he flew out to help his mom salvage what was left. They spent days sifting through the rubble. Jesse, a former college football player, took on the strenuous task of sorting through the wreckage in the deep, charcoaled hull of their basement. The whole family wore masks to protect their lungs from the dust and gloves to shield their hands from sharp objects. But it wasn’t protection enough from the danger lurking in the dirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three weeks later, Jesse had to fly back home to Alabama, where he was working as a sportscaster. He was in charge of covering the annual Sugar Bowl college football game in New Orleans — a big opportunity. But when he got there, something didn’t feel right. “I felt like I had gotten hit by a bus,” he said. Jesse chalked it up to jet lag and pushed through with the broadcast. But his symptoms didn’t subside. Instead, they got much, much worse. Within a couple of days, he was coughing and running a low-grade fever. A rash had appeared on his upper torso. “I remember being miserable,” he said. “I wasn’t sleeping.” Once the rash started moving up his neck, about four days after he first started feeling sick, Jesse knew he had to get to an urgent care clinic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That was the first of many doctor’s visits. For a month, Jesse’s symptoms worsened. Giant welts appeared around his joints like someone had whacked him all over with a baseball bat. He developed pneumonia, which made everything hurt, even breathing. Walking was painful. “It felt like someone was stabbing the bottom of my feet with knives,” Jesse recalled.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time his primary care doctor discovered a six-centimeter mass in his lung, Jesse was starting to think that whatever disease he had might actually end up killing him. He was scheduled for a biopsy and a spinal tap — last-ditch efforts to find the source of his illness. But on the morning of the procedures, a team of infectious disease specialists appeared in his hospital room. “It was like I was on an episode of &lt;em&gt;House&lt;/em&gt; or something,” Jesse said, chuckling. The biopsy and the spinal tap were suddenly irrelevant. The specialists were able to give him what his regular doctor couldn’t: a diagnosis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jesse had a disease called Valley fever. It’s caused by one of two strains of a fungus called &lt;em&gt;Coccidioides&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Cocci&lt;/em&gt; for short, that thrive in soils in California and the desert Southwest. The mass in his lung wasn’t cancer, it was a fungal ball — a glob of fungal hyphae, or mushroom filaments, and mucus. The infectious disease specialists started him on an intravenous drip of fluconazole, an antifungal medication. “Instantly, I started feeling better,” Jesse said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jesse got lucky that day. The infectious disease experts were in the right place at the right time. Some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tortolitaalliance.com/post/cocci-chronicles-part-iii-symptoms-diagnosis-maybe&quot;&gt;60 percent&lt;/a&gt; of Valley fever cases produce no symptoms or mild symptoms that most patients confuse with the flu or a common cold. But 30 percent of those infected develop a moderate illness that requires medical care, like what Jesse had. And another 10 percent have severe infections — the disseminated form of the disease, when the fungus spreads beyond the lungs into other parts of the body. Those cases can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctors don’t know why certain people experience no symptoms while others wind up in the emergency room. But they do know that pregnant people, the immunocompromised, African Americans, and Filipinos are especially at risk. And they also know that &lt;em&gt;Cocci&lt;/em&gt; is a generalist. Any person, dog, or other mammal who breathes in air laced with the fungal spores is at risk of developing the disease, which kills roughly 200 people in the U.S. every year. No vaccine currently exists, and the antifungal treatment is a bandaid, not a cure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jesse’s difficulty getting a fast and accurate diagnosis isn’t an isolated incident. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC, estimates that some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2014/01/27/valley-fever-the-silent-epidemic-is-getting-worse.html#:~:text=And%20the%20CDC%20estimates%20that,do%20not%20contract%20valley%20fever.&quot;&gt;150,000 cases&lt;/a&gt; of Valley fever go undiagnosed every year, though that’s likely just the tip of the iceberg, doctors and epidemiologists told Grist. The disease is only endemic to certain geographic areas and it’s technically considered an “emerging illness,” even though doctors have been finding it in their patients for more than a century, because cases have been sharply rising in recent years. In some places, astronomically so. Valley fever cases in the U.S. increased by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/turning-heat-valley-fever&quot;&gt;32 percent between 2016 and 2018&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC. One study determined that cases in California rose &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33270616/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;800 percent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between 2000 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In most states where the disease is endemic, public health departments have been slow to grasp and advertise the breadth and potential impact of the illness, experts say, and the federal government could be doing more to fund research into a cure or vaccine for the infection. To date, there’s only been one multi-center, prospective comparative trial for the treatment of Valley fever. And, more troubling, researchers haven’t pinned down exactly what’s behind the rise in cases or how to stop it. One thing is nearly certain, though: Climate change plays a role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator has-css-opacity&quot;&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;In 1892, a medical student in Buenos Aires named Alejandro Posadas met an Argentinian soldier who was seeking treatment for a dermatological problem. Posadas documented a fungal-like mass on the patient’s right cheek. Over the course of the next seven years, the soldier experienced worsening skin lesions and fever, and eventually died. His story is the first case of disseminated &lt;em&gt;Coccidioidomycosis&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/44/9/1202/328906&quot;&gt;on record&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, a manual laborer in the San Joaquin Valley walked into a hospital in San Francisco with skin lesions that looked a lot like the lesions on the Buenos Aires patient. The methods doctors used in San Francisco to treat the patient were barbaric. They cut chunks out of his face and treated the lesions with oil of turpentine, carbolic acid, and scrubbed his raw skin with a bichloride solution. They only succeeded in torturing their patient, who eventually died.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the next few decades, as more people got sick with &lt;em&gt;Coccidioidomycosis&lt;/em&gt; and died, doctors figured out that the organism causing this disease often entered victims through the lungs. In 1929, a 26-year-old medical student at Stanford University Medical School cut open a dried &lt;em&gt;Coccidioides&lt;/em&gt; culture and accidentally breathed in its spores. Nine days later, he was bedridden. But this time, the patient’s conditions improved and he eventually recovered. His illness would soon help doctors make a crucial connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was only a few years later that the Kern County Department of Public Health in California began investigating the causes of a common disorder called “San Joaquin fever,” “Desert fever,” or “Valley fever,” which got its name from the state’s Central Valley, where the disease was prevalent. As doctors reviewed evidence from Kern County, they noticed commonalities between cases of Valley fever there and the disease the Stanford student experienced. Valley fever, they hypothesized, represented the &lt;em&gt;Coccidioidomycosis&lt;/em&gt; infection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the following decades, researchers would discover some important truths about Valley fever. They found that it is endemic to certain areas of the world, that the fungus that causes the disease lives in soil, that a majority of people infected by it are asymptomatic, and, crucially, that weather patterns and seasonal climate conditions have an effect on the prevalence of &lt;em&gt;Coccidioides.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator has-css-opacity&quot;&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;A few years ago, Morgan Gorris, an Earth systems scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, decided to investigate an important question: What makes a place hospitable to &lt;em&gt;Cocci&lt;/em&gt;? She soon discovered that the fungus thrives in a set of specific conditions. U.S. counties that are endemic to Valley fever have an average annual temperature above 50 degrees Fahrenheit and get under 600 millimeters of rain a year. “Essentially, they were hot and dry counties,” Gorris told Grist. She stuck the geographic areas that met those parameters on a map and overlaid them with CDC estimates on where &lt;em&gt;Cocci &lt;/em&gt;grows. Sure enough, the counties, which stretch from West Texas through the Southwest and up into California (with a small patch in Washington State) matched up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But then Gorris took her analysis a &lt;a href=&quot;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GH000209&quot;&gt;step further&lt;/a&gt;. She decided to look at what would happen to Valley fever under a high-emissions climate change scenario. In other words, whether the disease would spread if humans continued emitting &lt;span class=&quot;tooltipsall tooltipsincontent classtoolTips1&quot;&gt;greenhouse gases&lt;/span&gt; business-as-usual. “Once I did that, I found that by the end of the 21st century, much of the western U.S. could become endemic to Valley fever,” she said. “Our endemic area could expand as far north as the U.S.-Canada border.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image alignfull js-breaks-column&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-ups-image-inner&quot;&gt;&lt;img decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ValleyFeverClimateChange_Gorrisetal2019-2.gif&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; srcset=&quot;https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ValleyFeverClimateChange_Gorrisetal2019-2.gif?w=330 330w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ValleyFeverClimateChange_Gorrisetal2019-2.gif?w=1024 768w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ValleyFeverClimateChange_Gorrisetal2019-2.gif?w=160&amp;amp;h=90&amp;amp;crop=1 160w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ValleyFeverClimateChange_Gorrisetal2019-2.gif?w=640&amp;amp;h=853&amp;amp;crop=1 640w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ValleyFeverClimateChange_Gorrisetal2019-2.gif?w=96&amp;amp;h=96&amp;amp;crop=1 96w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ValleyFeverClimateChange_Gorrisetal2019-2.gif?w=150 150w, https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ValleyFeverClimateChange_Gorrisetal2019-2.gif 1024w&quot; alt=&quot;a moving map of the US with color coding indicating large swaths of the West will experience an expansion of Valley fever in response to high climate warming through 2095&quot; data-caption=&quot;&quot; data-credit=&quot;Morgan Gorris / GeoHealth / University of California Irvine&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Morgan Gorris / GeoHealth / University of California Irvine&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s reason to believe this &lt;em&gt;Cocci&lt;/em&gt; expansion could be happening already, Bridget Barker, a researcher at Northern Arizona University, told Grist. Parts of Utah, Washington state, and Northern Arizona have all had Valley fever outbreaks recently. “That’s concerning to us because, yes, it would indicate that it’s happening right now,” Barker said. “If we look at the overlap with soil temperatures, we do really see that &lt;em&gt;Cocci&lt;/em&gt; seems to be somewhat restricted by freezing.” Barker is still working on determining what the soil temperature threshold for the &lt;em&gt;Cocci&lt;/em&gt; fungus is. But, in general, the fact that more and more of the U.S. could soon have conditions ripe for &lt;em&gt;Cocci&lt;/em&gt; proliferation, she said, is worrying.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is a massive economic burden associated with the potential expansion of Valley fever into new areas. Gorris conducted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/13/1/wcas-d-20-0036.1.xml&quot;&gt;separate analysis&lt;/a&gt; based on future warming scenarios and found that, by the end of the century, the average total annual cost of Valley fever infections could rise to $18.5 billion per year, up from $3.9 billion today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gorris’ research investigates how and where &lt;em&gt;Cocci&lt;/em&gt; might move as the climate warms. But what’s behind the rise in cases where &lt;em&gt;Cocci&lt;/em&gt; is already well-established, like in Ventura, where Jesse Merrick’s family home burnt down, is still an area of investigation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jesse thinks the cause of his Valley fever infection is obvious. “I clearly see a correlation between the fires and Valley fever,” he told Grist. But scientists aren’t exactly sure what environmental factors drive &lt;em&gt;Cocci&lt;/em&gt; transmission, and neither are public officials.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://s29449.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Valley-Fever-Eng.pdf&quot;&gt;December 2018 bulletin&lt;/a&gt;, Ventura County Health Officer Robert Levin cast doubt on the connection between &lt;em&gt;Cocci&lt;/em&gt; and wildfires. “As Health Officer for Ventura County, I don’t see a clear-cut connection between wildfires and &lt;em&gt;Cocci&lt;/em&gt; infections,” he said, noting that only one of the 4,000 firefighters who worked on the Thomas Fire in 2017 got Valley fever. Jennifer Head, a doctoral student at the University of California, Berkeley, who works for a lab studying the effects of wildfires on Valley fever, hasn’t seen much evidence backing up such a connection either. “The media talks a lot about wildfires and Valley fever and the general speculation is that wildfires will increase Valley fever,” she said. But the closest thing Head could find linking the two was a non-peer-reviewed abstract — a scientific summary — that wasn’t attached to a larger paper.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What experts do know, however, is that disturbing soil, especially soil that hasn’t been touched in a long time, in areas that are endemic to &lt;em&gt;Cocci &lt;/em&gt;tends to send the dangerous fungal spores swirling into the air and, inevitably, people’s lungs. That’s why wildland firefighters tend to get Valley fever, not necessarily from the flames themselves, but from digging line breaks in the soil to help contain fires. Construction sites are responsible for a huge quantity of Valley fever infections for the same reason.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the fact that researchers haven’t been able to find a link between wildfires and &lt;em&gt;Cocci &lt;/em&gt;doesn’t necessarily mean that Jesse’s theory about how he contracted his illness is incorrect. Researchers have documented the&lt;em&gt; Cocci&lt;/em&gt; fungi living in many parts of California. But the fungus isn’t evenly distributed throughout the areas where it grows. Think of a mountainside covered in wildflowers, John Galgiani, director of the Valley Fever Center for Excellence in Arizona, told Grist. Wildflowers grow in swaths across mountains, not evenly saturated throughout the landscape. &lt;em&gt;Coccidioides &lt;/em&gt;similarly grows in flushes across the landscape. That means a wildfire that breaks out in an area that is endemic to Valley fever won’t necessarily encounter a vein of &lt;em&gt;Cocci &lt;/em&gt;fungi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If a fire happened to be where there was Valley fever fungus in the soil, then that would be a risk,” Galgiani said. “But that’s a little different statement than &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; wildfires cause Valley fever.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And no research has been published, yet, on the possibility of &lt;em&gt;Cocci&lt;/em&gt; being spread to humans in wildfire smoke, though plenty of research has been conducted on the effects of smoke on human respiratory systems. “The potential for human pathogens to be spread in wildfire smoke has been ignored by those working on the health impacts of wildfire smoke just completely,” Jason Smith, a professor of forest pathology at the University of Florida, told Grist. He’s working with a group of researchers across the U.S. on a study that seeks to determine whether &lt;em&gt;Cocci &lt;/em&gt;spores and a host of other fungal pathogens can travel via wildfire smoke. The portion of his research that focuses on &lt;em&gt;Cocci&lt;/em&gt; is still in its early stages, but previous studies he’s worked on have demonstrated that fungal spores can indeed travel quite far in smoke. “There’s just no reason why &lt;em&gt;Cocci&lt;/em&gt; would be immune from that,” he said. “Now humans getting sick from it? More so than they do under ambient conditions? That’s the difficult part — determining that that’s occurring.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The connection between climatic changes and Valley fever is a bit clearer. Researchers speculate that a pattern of intense drought followed by intense rain may be driving the rise in Valley fever cases. When there’s a prolonged drought, the fungus in the soil tends to dry up and die. But no drought goes on forever — at least not in most parts of the U.S. When the rains eventually come back, the fungus flourishes. Then when the next drought hits and soils and the fungus dry out again, it is easy for wind — or a firefighter’s shovel or a hiker’s boot — to disturb and disseminate the abundant rain-spurred spores.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The big issue is drought, it’s dryness,” Julie Parsonnet, a specialist in adult infectious diseases at Stanford University, told Grist. “And after a period of rain it’s even worse.” Parsonnet sees the real-world consequences of that dry-wet cycle at Stanford, where she works at a referral center that sees patients with even worse Valley fever than Jesse had — the really bad cases. “We see really terrible disease with the fungus affecting their brains and their bones,” she said. “In terms of how severe it is and the lifelong requirement for some of these people for treatment, it’s worrisome. We don’t want to see it. It would be a bad thing to see more &lt;em&gt;Cocci&lt;/em&gt; than we have already.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parsonnet has been at Stanford for three decades, and over that time, she’s not only seen more Valley fever cases, but more severe cases. “In the last few years, I’ve been taking care of three or four Valley fever patients at any given time,” she said. “In the first 20 years I was here, I saw maybe one or two total.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator has-css-opacity&quot;&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;Decades have come and gone since researchers first connected the dots between the &lt;em&gt;Cocci&lt;/em&gt; fungus and Valley fever. A growing body of research supports the idea that climate change is now making this disease worse. Yet public awareness of what Valley fever is and how it works, in addition to the medical know-how to tackle this disease, is still lacking, even in states where Valley fever is prevalent. “You’d be surprised by how delayed the diagnosis is,” Galgiani, from the Valley Fever Center for Excellence in Arizona, told Grist. “And that’s the patients who get diagnosed.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Part of the blame lies in the way doctors practice medicine. An accurate Valley fever diagnosis may hinge on no more than where the attending physician went to medical school. “Many of the doctors who practice here learn medicine where the disease doesn’t exist, like in New York, for example,” Galgiani said. Another issue is the length of time it takes for the Valley fever blood test to come back from the lab — typically around two weeks. Clinicians in an outpatient setting like an urgent care clinic or emergency room are often reluctant to order a test that won’t come back before the patient goes home. “If the test comes back positive, they have to find the patient and tell them, ‘There’s a problem here.’ It’s not what they like to do,” Galgiani said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When doctors do order a Valley fever blood test, the results of that test aren’t guaranteed to be accurate. One in five Valley fever tests produce a false negative, said Steven Oscherwitz, an infectious disease doctor at Southern Arizona Infectious Disease Specialists. “It can be kind of silent and hard to diagnose because our tests just aren’t that great,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But part of the blame also lies with states and the way their public health departments prioritize diseases. Laurence Mirels, an infectious disease specialist in San Jose, California, who is affiliated with the California Institute for Medical Research, said that Valley fever has long languished behind HIV, West Nile Virus, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and other communicable or vector-borne diseases in states’ list of public health priorities. That’s despite the fact that the disease’s morbidity rate in the regions where it is endemic is &lt;a href=&quot;https://vfce.arizona.edu/about/message-center-director&quot;&gt;comparable&lt;/a&gt; to polio, measles, and chicken pox before those diseases were stymied by vaccines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The things that public health departments tend to focus on are things that can be transmitted and can increase exponentially if the source isn’t dealt with,” Mirels said. “&lt;em&gt;Cocci&lt;/em&gt; isn’t quite that way.” The disease can’t be passed on from person to person.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not like COVID where you’re well one day and dead the next week,” Parsonnet, from Stanford University, said. “If you have bad &lt;em&gt;Cocci &lt;/em&gt;it’ll drag on for years and maybe even decades. And for that reason it makes less of a splash.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Out of all the states in the U.S. that are endemic to Valley fever, Arizona is best equipped to handle the rise in &lt;em&gt;Cocci &lt;/em&gt;cases. The state public health department keeps close tabs on Valley fever and regularly reports cases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Valley Fever Center for Excellence, housed within the University of Arizona, helps facilitate collaboration between doctors and researchers across multiple counties within Arizona and develops strategies for diagnosing and treating Valley fever. The Arizona Department of Health Services, the state’s public health department, has spent time and resources trying to raise Valley fever awareness among Arizonans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason Arizona is ahead of the curve. It has the highest rates of Valley fever in the nation. “Arizona is a special case because it’s hard for them to ignore it,” Galgiani said. “It’s the second or third most frequently reported public health disease in the state. That’s not the case anywhere else in the country.” Other states like Utah, Texas, New Mexico, and Washington are also clocking rising rates of Valley fever, but it may be some time before the disease poses a big enough risk to residents that public health departments in those states start dedicating significant time and resources to it. West Texas, for example, is an “intensely endemic” region, Galgiani said. But the Texas Department of State Health Services doesn’t even report Valley fever cases to the CDC yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think it’ll probably take expanding numbers to get people’s attention to make this a higher priority among everything else that needs attention,” Galgiani said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s evidence that that is already starting to happen in California, where Valley fever is becoming an increasingly serious public health threat. In an email to Grist, a spokesperson for the California Department of Public Health noted that Valley fever cases in the state nearly tripled between 2015 and 2019, from roughly 3,000 cases to 9,000. “The annual number of reported cases has increased significantly since 2010,” the spokesperson said. The Department of Public Health got funding from the CDC in 2012 to hire an epidemiologist to study fungal diseases in the state, and it launched a $2 million Valley fever awareness campaign in 2018. “I think there is a kind of an awakening of the understanding that this is a problem,” Mirels said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But even in Arizona, the state at the head of the pack, more could be done to alert residents to the dangers posed by Valley fever. Some residents suspect optics may be trumping public safety. “Imagine that you put ads up that say, ‘You’re going to catch this terrible disease if you come here, look at what it does to people,” Oscherwitz said. “They’re not going to really want to do that because tourism would be affected and nobody is going to come here who hears that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think there’s been reluctance by politicians to advertise this disease because it might deter people from coming here,” said Mark Johnson, President of the Tortolita Alliance, a conservancy group in Arizona that advocates for better Valley fever awareness. “But that is not the important thing. They should be doing everything in their power to make people aware of the disease.” Johnson, who contracted valley fever last year after retiring to Arizona, argued that if the state was really dedicated to protecting Arizonans from Valley fever, it would run advertisements on TV, put up signs up airports, and send out brochures, especially to new residents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator has-css-opacity&quot;&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;Valley fever on its own is a formidable and expensive illness to contend with. But it’s not the only fungal pathogen lurking beneath our feet. There are three main types of fungi that cause lung infections in humans in the U.S., including &lt;em&gt;Cocci&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Histoplasmosis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;blastomycosis&lt;/em&gt; also pose risks to humans. It’s possible that the same environmental conditions that may be helping &lt;em&gt;Cocci&lt;/em&gt; spread into new areas and become more prevalent are also motivating those fungi. Researchers can’t say for sure whether that’s happening yet, but it’s something they’re working on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I can’t really speak to what those predictions might be,” Barker, from Northern Arizona University, said. “But my colleagues have noticed similar trends where there’s an increase in reported disease.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And another wrinkle: There aren’t nearly enough people studying these pathogens. Every time a human fungal pathogen researcher retires, the field grows smaller. “We’re behind all of these other groups,” Barker said. “We’re behind the bacteriologists and the virologists in terms of our understanding of some of these ecological principles driving distribution of these organisms and what might cause them to emerge in human populations.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For most of the rest of us, the pathogens hiding in the ground aren’t much of a consideration at all. That applies to Jesse Merrick, too. For him, Valley fever is a distant, if terrible, memory now. He doesn’t let it stop him from doing the things he wants to do. He still goes on hikes and visits his mom in California. And he recently moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, an area that is endemic to Valley fever. “It’s in the back of my head but nothing where it’s something I think about daily or anything like that,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It may only be a matter of time before we start thinking about fungus more often, Barker said. “I honestly think that the fungal pathogens are going to be a huge problem for us going forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
