                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Shein Back?&lt;/strong&gt; Looks like it.&lt;br&gt;
For those of you who have been living under a rock, here&#39;s a recap:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shein is a fast fashion brand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is headquartered in Singapore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was banned in India 4 years ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people remember the last point. Right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;29 June 2020,&lt;/strong&gt; the Indian Government banned many Chinese apps. &lt;strong&gt;Shein and 58 other Chinese apps were booted from India&lt;/strong&gt; due to national security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shein’s comeback raises many questions—the hows and the whys—but the one that bugs the most is, &quot;Another fast fashion brand in India, so what? What&#39;s the big deal?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Well, the big deal is Shein’s popular &quot;&lt;strong&gt;on-demand fashion&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a nice concept, especially for a fast fashion brand. Shein uses real-time data to determine which styles are in trend and turns them into affordable clothing lines faster than we can finish saying, &quot;shopping spree&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India is a great market for clothing brands like Shein, with booming internet usage and a growing middle class hungry for affordable fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grapevine suggests that Reliance Retail signed a partnership agreement with Shein over a year ago. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
A partnership between Reliance Retail and Shein might eradicate the security concerns that led to the app&#39;s ban and benefit the consumers. It might also come with sustainability costs that come hand in hand with fast fashion brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s find out…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why is Shein Coming Back?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shein is coming back because we missed it! (Obviously, there’s more to it.) Apparently, Shein is an expert in producing trendy, affordable clothing, and we Indians love a good deal. It&#39;s clothes are cheap for two main reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/shein-india-reliance#&quot; title=&quot;When you buy 10 of something, it&#39;s cheaper than 1 of the same thing. That&#39;s called economies of scale. The more a company produces, the less it costs per piece. this helps businesses save money.&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economies of scale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (they produce clothes in bulk)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low quality (It’s all polyester now.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-fashion brands like Shein target middle-class customers with cheap and trendy collections. The Indian market is very attractive for fast fashion brands, as evidenced by the success of &lt;strong&gt;Zara&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;H&amp;amp;M&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Uniqlo&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indian middle class has welcomed these foreign brands with open arms, so it’s not surprising that Shein wants back in the game. We love to shop online, and the rising number of active internet users, expected to reach &lt;strong&gt;900 million by&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;2025&lt;/strong&gt;, is another reason why India is a big potential market for fast fashion. .&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question for Shein is, &#39;Is the fast fashion industry viable?&#39; Yes, the industry is doing well, as you will learn in the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, with the rising demand for sustainability, fast fashion’s survival is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How is Shein Coming Back?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shein might be shaking hands with Reliance Retail. It looks like a strategic decision, for sure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of advantages to this supposed alliance for Shein:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to Reliance&#39;s Extensive Retail Network:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;Reliance&lt;/span&gt; has a massive network of physical stores and a very popular e-commerce platform, Ajio. By collaborating with Reliance Retail, Shein&#39;s distribution in India will be immediate and widespread. Imagine trying on Shein’s clothes in a Reliance Trends store.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leveraging Reliance&#39;s Expertise and Infrastructure: &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/market-news/reliance-retail-one-stop-shop-investors?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=insider-interlinking&amp;amp;utm_content=shein-explained&amp;amp;utm_term=reliance-retail-one-stop-shop-investors&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Reliance Retail as a One-Stop Shop for Investors&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;Reliance Retail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has market expertise and strong logistics. Shein can use Reliance&#39;s infrastructure, supply chain, and operational know-how to its advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory Approval and Compliance:&lt;/strong&gt; Reliance is a big wig, a market leader. It is entirely possible that Reliance will help Shein secure the necessary regulatory approvals from the Indian government for its re-entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Localisation and Adaptation:&lt;/strong&gt; Shein is not a homegrown brand. Obviously, it will need to localise its products and strategies for Indian consumers. Reliance&#39;s understanding of Indian consumer preferences and market dynamics can help Shein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Sovereignty and Control: &lt;/strong&gt;Shein was banned because it was accused of sharing user data without consent, putting our information at risk. The best part of this to-be deal is that Shein will have no direct access to sensitive customer data. Everything from the platform, data, and operations will be owned and controlled by Reliance&#39;s subsidiary. Data security and Shein in the same sentence; wow!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shein&#39;s technology and trademarks are now licensed to Reliance&lt;/strong&gt;. Together, they&#39;re launching an exclusive e-commerce platform for Indian customers featuring Shein&#39;s popular products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This platform, managed by Reliance&#39;s fully Indian-owned subsidiary, ensures data security by keeping Shein&#39;s Indian app separate from its global one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Shein&#39;s Business Model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shein&#39;s business model is centred around providing trendy and affordable fashion items to a global customer base through an on-demand, data-driven approach. Here are the aspects of Shein&#39;s business model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;a. Trend Identification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Shein does is it identifies the current fashion trends on the go. It uses real-time data analytics and monitors demand to adapt. Although fashion trends are fickle, Shein has managed to keep up with the latest consumer trends with this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knew the masses wanted cottagecore or dark academia core before Shein did? Did the people even know? The below costume designs will shed some light on it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Cottagecore&quot; height=&quot;700&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/c85ac12bb5264a99b213564200cc1117.png&quot; width=&quot;442&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Cottagecore Designs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Dark Academia core&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/491b6a3dcd114a5fadab3ada6c2de246.png&quot; width=&quot;768&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Dark Academia Core Designs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;b. Design and Development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Shein, design and development is the same as Research &amp;amp; Development for any other company. The catch is that Shein must rely on something other than in-house designers like traditional retailers. What is the solution, then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shein replicates designs from individual designers and produces in-trend clothing. This is a kind of theft of intellectual property. Do you think it&#39;s ethical? Let me know your thoughts in the comments. 👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;c. Production&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shein follows an on-demand production strategy. It manufactures small batches of 100-200 items. Then, based on real-time customer feedback, in-demand products are restocked. The highly automated process ensures supplier partners produce what customers want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Shein&#39;s Business Model&quot; height=&quot;2350&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/89b92b6e62cb46c5a52edd9b46d60b40.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1880&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/C-ISs0yi6ZJ/?igsh=MTF1cGMxOGEwOXB5NA==&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Finology Insider&#39;s Instagram Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shein outsources the production part to third-party manufacturing units that quickly turn designs into finished products. This on-demand production strategy reduces production costs, allowing Shein to offer its products at low prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;d. Inventory Management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shein uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/shein-india-reliance#&quot; title=&quot;Lean inventory is an inventory management system. The concept is simple; produce only what you need. This helps reduce waste and ideal stock.&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lean inventory &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;method. It uses real-time data on sales, consumer behaviour, and trends to optimise its inventory. Thanks to the lean inventory management system, Shein&#39;s unsold inventory rate is only 10%. That means it sells 90% of the products it produces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shein&#39;s &quot;small orders, fast returns” strategy lets it quickly test new products and ramp up production on bestsellers, slashing waste from unsold inventory. With AI-driven warehouse management and delivery scheduling, Shein supercharges the efficiency and accuracy of its logistics, ensuring faster and smarter operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Shein&#39;s Revenue Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back when it was in India, Shein was popular. All the girls I knew were ordering Shein&#39;s cheap and trendy products left and right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shein&#39;s global revenue in 2022 was &lt;strong&gt;$22.7 billion (₹1,90,059 crore)&lt;/strong&gt;. In 2023, it took a huge leap of &lt;strong&gt;43% to the tune of $32.5 billion (₹2,72,025 crore)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did it ever occur to you, &lt;em&gt;itna sasta hai to profit kaha se kama raha hai?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Shein&#39;s Revenue Streams:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a. Online Sales: &lt;/strong&gt;Shein&#39;s revenue is majorly thanks to its online sales. With a direct-to-customer sales model, the brand sells its products directly to its customers via its online platform. No retailers, no intermediaries and no costs that come hand in hand with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b. Affiliate program: &lt;/strong&gt;An affiliate program is when a company pays people, mostly influencers, to help sell its products. If the influencers promote the product and their followers buy it, the company gives them money. Shein&#39;s Insta famous affiliate program is a win-win situation. The influencers get a commission, and Shein gets more traffic and new customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some of the main streams of revenue for Shein. The company also earns advertising money by taking advantage of its high web traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Retail Industry Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shein’s re-entry can have an impact on the Indian retail industry and on Reliance Retail’s parent company as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that &lt;strong&gt;10% of the GDP comes from the Indian retail industry&lt;/strong&gt;? It&#39;s one of the fastest growing and the largest. The Indian retail industry is divided into many parts, such as the apparel market, food &amp;amp; grocery market, electronics etc.&lt;/p&gt;

Click on &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/stock-market/fastest-growing-industries-in-india?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=insider-interlinking&amp;amp;utm_content=shein-explained&amp;amp;utm_term=fastest-growing-industries-in-india&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Top 7 Fastest Growing Industries in India&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this link&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a detailed article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 parts to the Indian apparel market as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independent local stores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organised retail segment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just imagine how many local stores there are. The sheer quantity of independent local stores is the reason why it covers &lt;strong&gt;90% of the trade in the Indian apparel market&lt;/strong&gt;. The organised retail segment includes retail stores like &lt;strong&gt;Reliance&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Trends&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Pantaloons&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Max&lt;/strong&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organised sector has a lot of catching up to do. With many large corporations like &lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;Reliance&lt;/span&gt; backing up these chains and the ever-growing love of e-commerce platforms, the organised sector may not stay behind for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the revenue from the apparel market in India is projected to reach an impressive &lt;strong&gt;$105.50 billion ( ₹8,83,035 crore)&lt;/strong&gt;, with an annual growth rate of&lt;strong&gt; 3.81%&lt;/strong&gt;. This market consists of online as well as offline clothing stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings us to the question of who or what is contributing to the growth of the Indian apparel market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The growing middle class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rising incomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing consumer preferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Urbanisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market is dominated by the women&#39;s apparel segment, with a whopping&lt;strong&gt; volume of $51.05 billion (₹4,27,348.5 crore) &lt;/strong&gt;in 2024. In the same year, India&#39;s &lt;strong&gt;per-person revenue is close to $73.19 billion (₹6,12,780.3 crore)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indian apparel market is expecting much bigger numbers in the future. It is expected that the volume will reach an astounding &lt;strong&gt;40.1 billion (4,010 crore) pieces by 2028 &lt;/strong&gt;and a projected volume growth of&lt;strong&gt; 3.7% in 2025&lt;/strong&gt;. (More people or more clothes? You tell me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is anticipated that in 2024, the &lt;strong&gt;average volume per person will be 24.2 pieces&lt;/strong&gt;, and 99% of sales will come from non-luxury items. A big reason for the surge in the Indian market is consumers’ bleeding hearts. Consumer demands have shifted drastically towards sustainable and ethically sourced/produced things, even when it comes to clothing. When it comes to ethics and sustainability, many brands have been victims of the cancel culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Shein&#39;s Financials: Is It Steady?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shein is all over Instagram. Even though the app is banned in India, second-hand exposure to the brand cannot be banned—at least not entirely. Just because it&#39;s banned in India doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s also banned in other countries. In fact, Shein currently operates in more than 150 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess how many active shoppers Shein has. In 2023, the number was around &lt;strong&gt;88.8 million (8.88 crore)&lt;/strong&gt;, of which &lt;strong&gt;17.3 million (1.73 crore) were from the US&lt;/strong&gt; alone. There’s no denying that the brand has a customer base that is not only humongous but also diverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shein was the most downloaded fashion app of the year, with over&lt;strong&gt; 238 million downloads in 2023&lt;/strong&gt;. A sure proof that Shein is popular and in-demad. Shein&#39;s revenue increased from&lt;strong&gt; $0.61 billion (₹5,105.7 crore) in 2016 to $22.7 billion (₹1,89,999 crore) in 2023&lt;/strong&gt;, surpassing even H&amp;amp;M. It&#39;s even projected to surpass &lt;strong&gt;Inditex (flagship brand: Zara) &lt;/strong&gt;in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shein is leaving world-renowned brands like H&amp;amp;M and soon Zara in the dust. Is this a sign of the brand&#39;s dominant position in the fast fashion industry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Profitability&quot; height=&quot;1484&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/268eac225820427d9a03653e8aa4a53b.jpg&quot; width=&quot;2569&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Shein&#39;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;net income dropped to $700 million (₹5,859 crores) in 2022 from $1,100 million (₹9,207 crores)&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;in 2021&lt;/strong&gt;, but it bounced right back in 2023 with a net income of $2,000 million (₹16,740 crores).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Peer Comparison&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If and when Shein re-enters the Indian market, its competitors will be H&amp;amp;M, Zara, and Uniqlo. It might also affect e-commerce platforms like &lt;strong&gt;Myntra&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/finance/sachin-bansal-success-story?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=insider-interlinking&amp;amp;utm_content=shein-explained&amp;amp;utm_term=sachin-bansal-success-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Story of Sachin Bansal: From Flipkart to Navi&#39;s IPO&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flipkart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/entrepreneurship/amazon-jeff-bezos-growth-story?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=insider-interlinking&amp;amp;utm_content=shein-explained&amp;amp;utm_term=amazon-jeff-bezos-growth-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;How Amazon Became Big: The Growth Story&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/startups-india/success-story-of-nykaa?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=insider-interlinking&amp;amp;utm_content=shein-explained&amp;amp;utm_term=success-story-of-nykaa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nykaa Fashion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Shein&#39;s Peer Comparison&quot; height=&quot;2350&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/3c7b43b53384482da0dbf20bbbbc7de8.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1880&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shein&#39;s re-entry might cause a market disruption. Brands like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/entrepreneurship/h-m-sabyasachi-collaboration?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=insider-interlinking&amp;amp;utm_content=shein-explained&amp;amp;utm_term=h-m-sabyasachi-collaboration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;H&amp;amp;M &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/reliance-retail-azorte-store?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=insider-interlinking&amp;amp;utm_content=shein-explained&amp;amp;utm_term=reliance-retail-azorte-store&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zara&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have a very strong presence in India and robust customer loyalty. However, they might be more loyal to affordability. With Reliance&#39;s backing and its agile fashion production, Shein might gain the upper hand really fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been over a year since the deal between Reliance Retail and Shein, and yet we haven&#39;t seen any Shein products back in India. The question that keeps popping up is, “&lt;strong&gt;Do we really need more fast-fashion brands?&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast fashion contributes 10% to global carbon emissions—more than international shipping and flights combined! Fast Fashion encourages overconsumption and has grave environmental impacts. Words like “landfill,&quot; &quot;toxic,&quot; and &quot;microplastic” come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, Shein had quite a fan base in India before it was banned, but did we really miss it?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;

Indus Appstore’s Entry in India</title><description>&lt;div class=&quot;flex flex-col w100 align-center&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1020x680/blog/2b1a993db89b4db9ae01484bd8533998.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Google Play Store vs. PhonePe&#39;s Indus Appstore: Which is Better?&quot; class=&quot;w60 mt4 br075 m-w100 insiderimg m-br0 m-mt2 t-w70&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;

                &lt;div class=&quot;w60 m-w90 t-w70&quot; id=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;div class=&quot;insidertext&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;When you look at the history pages, inventions have been done based on two scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One is when the inventors predict something will happen and work on curating a way out of it,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another is when inventors are looking for ways to solve an existing problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PhonePe’s brand-new play store’s existence can also be connected to the second scenario. Google Play Store monopolising the market &lt;strong&gt;(over 95%) &lt;/strong&gt;and demanding hefty charges, including a &lt;strong&gt;commission of 30% on in-app payments&lt;/strong&gt;, led to a fight between the tech giant and Indian apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing the plight of Indian app makers, PhonePe decided to light up the “&lt;strong&gt;Make In India&lt;/strong&gt;” motto and came out with the “Indus Appstore.&quot; This app store, with the motto “&lt;em&gt;An App store that’s made for India&lt;/em&gt;,&quot; was&lt;strong&gt; launched in February 2024&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With no commission on in-app purchases being charged for developers, some apps on Indus Appstore might offer lower prices to consumers. This raises one question: Is it enough to beat the unbeatable “Google”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s find the answer to this question and check out other aspects of the app store you haven’t taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About Indus Appstore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indus Appstore was established as a strategic initiative by PhonePe to enhance its ecosystem and provide a richer digital experience to its users. At present, the Indus Appstore offers access to over&lt;strong&gt; 2 lakh apps&lt;/strong&gt;, including many catering to local tastes and needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Indus Appstore&#39;s Landing Page&quot; height=&quot;836&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/516e850a3a7a43b3b041657f1332dc67.png&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its establishment can be seen as a response to a few key factors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a growing desire in India for a homegrown app store that catered to the specific needs and preferences of Indian users. This sentiment intensified after a situation in September 2023 when &lt;strong&gt;Google delisted several Indian apps&lt;/strong&gt;, raising concerns about dependence on a single platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many Indian app developers felt stifled by Google Play Store&#39;s policies and commission demands. PhonePe aimed to create a fairer environment with Indus Appstore, offering &lt;strong&gt;free app listing&lt;/strong&gt; for the first year and&lt;strong&gt; no commission on in-app purchases&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stating the move as a “game-changer in India&#39;s digital journey,” the company says, “&lt;em&gt;For developers, Indus Appstore provides a fair and level playing field to list, distribute and promote their products in the Indian app ecosystem. It provides a self-publishing platform, localization services, multiple tools to monitor and grow their apps along with dedicated 24×7 customer support.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine an app store with over 2 lakh apps and games; all categorised neatly for easy browsing. Now imagine this store speaks your language – &lt;strong&gt;Hindi&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Tamil&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Marathi&lt;/strong&gt;, you name it! That’s the appeal Indus Appstore presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It offers apps in&lt;strong&gt; 12 regional languages&lt;/strong&gt;, making it accessible to almost everyone in India. But that&#39;s not all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PhonePe is making things super developer-friendly by providing everything that Google Play Store restricted for developers in India. Listing an app on Indus is&lt;strong&gt; completely free for the first year (until April 2025)&lt;/strong&gt;. Developers even get to choose which payment gateway works best for them with no restrictions whatsoever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What Does it Mean For You?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers all around the nation have been habitually using the Google Play Store to download apps for many years now. After all, it&#39;s an in-built app that restricts multiple functionalities of the device if not used. Hence, the monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what could Indus Appstore provide that may turn a consumer to replace Google? Let’s check out some options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;a. Localisation and Accessibility:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indus Appstore focuses on offering apps that cater specifically to Indian users. This includes regional languages, content, and applications that resonate with India&#39;s diverse cultural and linguistic landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;b. Security and Trust:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By curating apps and ensuring they meet certain standards, PhonePe aims to provide a safer and more trustworthy app ecosystem for consumers compared to global app stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;c. Integrated Experience:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indus Appstore adds value for consumers using PhonePe for payments and other financial services by integrating seamlessly with their existing digital interactions. This integration can potentially lead to a more cohesive and efficient user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;d. Support for Developers:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app store also benefits developers by providing them with a platform to reach a large user base, potentially increasing their app&#39;s visibility and downloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Will Indus Appstore be Able to Defeat Google Play Store?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what the whole point was about, right? At least as per the company’s statements. But, will this mission be possible to accomplish?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at Google Play Store’s market share:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Google Play Store’s Market Share&quot; height=&quot;1484&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/afc7075e87574736b209ec9b8ea8608b.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;2569&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure,&lt;strong&gt; Google (94.94%) &amp;amp; Apple&#39;s (4.22%) &lt;/strong&gt;Play Store are the two leading names, creating a duopoly in India. But is it really a duopoly when Google Play Store reigns over 90% of the market?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google, the search engine giant, has become so ingrained in our daily lives that it&#39;s easy to forget it might hold a lot of power. This dominance in the tech world is what we call a monopoly. Here&#39;s how it plays out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;a. Android Advantage:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most smartphones run on the Android operating system, which is freely offered by Google. However, phone makers often have to pre-install a bunch of Google apps on their devices, giving them a head start over competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;b. App Store Control:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Play Store is the main hub for downloading apps on Android devices. This gives Google control over app distribution and the ability to set policies and fees for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting here is Google has faced monopoly allegations, not once or twice, but multiple times in multiple countries. Even India has a few cases running against it. One recent case was&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt; filed by Indian startups like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/google-billing-policy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Google Vs Indian Startups: A War Against Google&#39;s Billing Policy&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;Shaadi.com against Google&#39;s Billing Policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am trying to say is beating the reigning and defending champion of the app store that comes hand in hand with a majorly used mobile operating system wouldn&#39;t be as easy as using the “Made in India” approach. After all, Google has compromised for its Indian consumers &amp;amp; developers by allowing them to add third-party payment gateways at a lower commission rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The&lt;strong&gt; Competition Commission of India (CCI)&lt;/strong&gt; fined Google over&lt;strong&gt; $1 billion (over ₹8,300 crore)&lt;/strong&gt; in 2023 for stifling competition on the Android platform. Moreover, PhonePe’s plan to squeeze profits out of Google’s legal plight in India could turn out differently as the &lt;strong&gt;National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT)&lt;/strong&gt; is still hearing Google&#39;s appeal. There&#39;s no final verdict yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, if NCLAT upholds the CCI decision, Google would have to comply with the regulations set by CCI, potentially leading to a more open app ecosystem in India. Most consumers and even developers won’t feel the need to change platforms if their issues can be resolved. So, PhonePe may have to come up with a better approach than the “Indian app store” for Indus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;PhonePe&#39;s Financials &amp;amp; Peer Comparison&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With over &lt;strong&gt;49 crore registered users&lt;/strong&gt;, PhonePe has achieved a significant milestone. One in four Indians now uses the platform. Additionally, the company has effectively&lt;strong&gt; digitised 3.6 crore offline merchants&lt;/strong&gt; located in tier 2, 3, 4, and beyond, encompassing &lt;strong&gt;99% of postal codes&lt;/strong&gt; across India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, PhonePe has emerged as the top performer in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/phonepe-indus-appstore-launch#&quot; title=&quot;The Bharat Bill Payment System is like a one-stop shop for all your bill payments in India. Launched by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), BBPS works with various billers, so you can pay for electricity, water, phone, gas, internet, and even education fees or municipal taxes – all through BBPS.&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bharat Bill Pay System (BBPS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, handling more than 45% of the transactions on the BBPS platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;PhonePe&#39;s Financials &quot; height=&quot;581&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/cc547bfba69b4d6ea1da2a8ab0459135.png&quot; width=&quot;1050&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Source: PhonePe&#39;s Earnings Statement&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#0e101a&quot;&gt;Looking at the financials, PhonePe did increase its revenue from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#0e101a&quot;&gt;₹1,646 crore to ₹2,914 crore &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#0e101a&quot;&gt;in a year, but the EBITDA also saw a negative increase, which is not a good sign. Hence, PhonePe will need to work consistently to improve its finances if it wishes to contribute more capital to advancements of its Play Store.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PhonePe has consistently aspired to provide its users with a platform to explore and share various applications, maintaining this goal over time. Its entrance into the app industry might not be able to make much of a difference to its peers, Google and Apple, but it&#39;s sure to help PhonePe strengthen its identity as an Indian app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, PhonePe even went so far as to&lt;strong&gt; transfer its domicile to India from Singapore in October 2023&lt;/strong&gt;. It had to &lt;strong&gt;pay ₹8,000 crore in taxes&lt;/strong&gt; for the shift to the government. Hence, PhonePe’s quest to solidify its presence as the first stop for most things in finance is very strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In India, the concern is that Google&#39;s monopoly limits consumer choices and hinders innovation by Indian app developers. The CCI&#39;s actions and the rise of the Indus Appstore signal India&#39;s push for a fairer and more open app ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or at least that’s what PhonePe’s founder wants us to believe. In reality, PhonePe is betting on further hammering its reputation as “the Indian app”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether this bet will be successful or not is yet to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;img src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1020x680/blog/8100efbe7f7e46f1a92356932b72d42e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;What’s the Hidden Truth Behind Cancelled Vistara Flights&quot; class=&quot;w60 mt4 br075 m-w100 insiderimg m-br0 m-mt2 t-w70&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;

                &lt;div class=&quot;w60 m-w90 t-w70&quot; id=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;div class=&quot;insidertext&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Summer has arrived. If you are also planning to spend your holidays chilling at a beach or skiing in hilltop locations, I suggest you book trains instead of flights. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because flights are being cancelled left &amp;amp; right, leaving passengers hanging midair (not literally, don&#39;t worry). The primary culprit of the year 2024 in the airline industry is Vistara Airlines. At least, that&#39;s the case until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where there is a requirement for more flights due to summer being the tourist season, Vistara had over &lt;strong&gt;150 flights either cancelled or delayed&lt;/strong&gt;. Frustrated passengers took their disappointment to the platform of shared misery, I mean social media, and mayhem erupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One post became thousands of haters sharing their woes, which finally attracted the attention of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/vistara-flight-booking#&quot; title=&quot; The Ministry of Civil Aviation acts as the central regulatory body for India&#39;s civil aviation sector. They are like the air traffic controllers for the entire civilian aviation industry handling policy regulation, licensing, international cooperation, etc.&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ministry of Civil Aviation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (MoCA). But now, the situation seems to be resolving with an upcoming merger. Come &lt;strong&gt;12 November, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;, Vistara will merge operations with Air India, creating a new entity in the airline industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will discuss the situation at Vistara, its impact on the aviation industry, and your lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Root Cause of Trouble at Vistara&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vistara Airlines was ordered by the government ministry MoCA to address the rising number of flight cancellations. They replied that the issue was the “&lt;em&gt;unavailability of crew members&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you don&#39;t know, every pilot has a fixed work schedule based on age, agility, and requirements. It&#39;s pretty similar to corporate employees having a fixed 9-5 or 10-6 work hour routine. There are days when, due to an urgent project or excess work, employees have to do overtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The condition at Vistara is like you (an employee) working for 3-4 hours overtime every day for the past month. Terrible, right? 😧&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Vistara pilots had no choice but to go on a &lt;strong&gt;mass sick leave&lt;/strong&gt;, which is considered to be the airline industry&#39;s version of a &lt;strong&gt;strike&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pilots are complaining about fatigue due to stretched rosters with high utilisation times. They want more rest time between flights as they feel overworked and underpaid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is there more to what meets the eye? Inside sources reveal that many pilots are not happy with a significant change coming at Vistara. Don&#39;t know what I am talking about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Vistara, which is the product of a joint venture between Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines, is soon going to be merged with Air India.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Vistara-Air India Merger&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2022, Tata Group announced a merger between Vistara and Air India. This is part of Tata&#39;s larger plan to consolidate its airline holdings, including&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/economy/downfall-of-air-india&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;Air India Express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;AIX Connect &lt;/strong&gt;(formerly Air Asia India). Now that the NCLT has given its green light for the approval, a large fleet with 218 aircrafts is set to form soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the merger is complete, there will be two leading airlines under the Tata umbrella:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A full-service carrier combining Air India and Vistara.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A low-cost carrier formed by merging Air India Express and AIX Connect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what would happen to Singapore Airlines? It will retain a &lt;strong&gt;25.1% stake&lt;/strong&gt; in the merged full-service carrier. Sweet deal, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, superficially, being associated with the airline of the nation, Air India, is like representing the country in the aviation industry. It should be a matter of pride for both pilots &amp;amp; crew members. But that&#39;s so not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some pilots are apprehensive about the planned merger with Air India, fearing a loss of identity and benefits. Integrating Vistara with Air India is a complex process, and pilot concerns might stem from uncertainties about how the merger will impact their careers. Here are a few possibilities that&#39;s airing the doubts &amp;amp; worries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;a. Pay Revision:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pilots are unhappy with a potential cut in their guaranteed monthly flying hours, which would lead to lower pay. This is because the airline wants to align its pay structure with Air India which has a different pay scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;b. Changed Work Structure &amp;amp; Culture:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most employees resign from their companies due to a deteriorating work culture despite being in impressive designations &amp;amp; payslips. At Vistara, along with a pay downgrade, work culture and workload could also dive. Integrating the workforces and cultures of two different airlines can be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vistara&#39;s management even gave an ultimatum to pilots and other employees to accept the new salary structure on an immediate basis or else be ready to lose their jobs. Harsh tactic but it seemed to have worked for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, now, don&#39;t think that the upcoming merger is only filled with shortcomings. It has its own&lt;strong&gt; set of advantages &lt;/strong&gt;as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The merger aims to create a stronger airline entity in &lt;strong&gt;India&#39;s aviation market&lt;/strong&gt;, which we will discuss below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combining routes and eliminating overlaps could lead to a more efficient network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passengers might benefit from a broader range of destinations and potentially improved services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Singapore Airlines hopes to strengthen its presence in the Indian market through this deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Aviation Sector Overview &amp;amp; Vistara’s Standing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://ticker.finology.in/sector/airlines&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;aviation sector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one of the fastest-growing in the world, fueled by a rising middle class and increasing disposable income. At present in 2024, the market size of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ticker.finology.in/sector&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;₹1.15 lakh crore&lt;/strong&gt;, predicted to touch &lt;strong&gt;₹2.16 lakh crore by 2030&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Aviation Sector Market Size&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/3d8da6c8faf54cddb7b1cfe430c009c7.png&quot; width=&quot;927&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Source: Mordor Intelligence&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The aviation sector is mainly divided into two categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low-cost carriers like &lt;strong&gt;IndiGo&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ticker.finology.in/company/SPICEJET&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SpiceJet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hold the majority of the market share, offering budget-friendly travel options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full-service carriers, known for premium cabins and amenities, have a smaller market share but are gaining traction with travellers seeking a more comfortable experience. &lt;strong&gt;Vistara&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;IndiGo&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;6E&lt;/strong&gt; are a few popular options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of market shares, here are the &lt;strong&gt;top airlines in India&lt;/strong&gt; as of February 2024 👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Top Airlines in India&quot; height=&quot;632&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/3c275f7bf14f46e1b9db312cd670abec.png&quot; width=&quot;858&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Source: DGCA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vistara is the second-largest domestic airline in India, with an approximate market share of 9.9%. It stands out as a premium carrier, offering features like spacious cabins, in-flight entertainment systems, and priority boarding. In fact, it was the &lt;strong&gt;first airline to introduce a premium economy in India&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, it won’t be farfetched to say that Vistara has carved a niche for itself with its focus on customer service and a modern fleet. So, the ongoing flight cancellations and delays in commute is causing a huge damage to the airline’s reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could also be a deal breaker for the to-be merged entity since it’s still awaiting approvals from the regulatory parties as of yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;What&#39;s Latest: 12 November&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 12 November 2024, Vistara bid a farewell. The Airline shared a heartwarming video on Twitter of its last flight, expressing gratitude to its customers for all these years of flying. It also hinted at establishing a new identity as Air India with the tag &lt;strong&gt;#ToLimitlessPossibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Twitter for Vistara-Air india Merger&quot; height=&quot;796&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/25dd977bb45a431c98fdc3c3e1207a87.png&quot; width=&quot;602&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vistara announced that beginning in September 2024, customers will gradually lose the privilege to book flights with Vistara for travel dates from 12 November, 2024 and onwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 1,15,000 passengers who scheduled their flights with Vistara after 12th Nov will now be flying under the Air India name. The company assures that the change in branding will not affect the overall service and onboarding experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Vistara-Air India merger has the potential to reshape the Indian aviation landscape. However, successfully navigating pilot issues and integrating the airlines effectively will be crucial for its success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vistara’s CEO Vinod Kannan&lt;/strong&gt; and other senior executives met with the pilots, promising them to “carefully scale back the network” and bring order to the excruciating schedule. The CEO also promised to discuss roster changes to accommodate the pay gap that the merger with Air India might bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the corrective measures acknowledged by the executives will be brought on board starting in May. But would words be enough to solve the issues? Will travellers reach their destinations on time, and pilots get their much-needed rest and salary? These kinds of questions and more are yet to be answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The merger will transform Air India by enhancing its offerings with Vistara’s premium service culture and modern fleet. It will lead to competitive pricing and an expanded route network, especially in under-served international markets.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Reliance Industries Ltd. is popular for dominating multiple sectors at once. Now, the conglomerate is going to expand its entertainment section even further by creating a central entertainment entity, covering nearly &lt;strong&gt;50% of the Indian streaming market share&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Reliance-Disney merger promises to be a game-changer for the Indian media and entertainment landscape. The timing of this merger being approved couldn’t be better as the infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/zee-sony-merger?utm_source=Insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=Articles&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Interlinking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Details of the Zee-Sony merger&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zee-Sony merger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; met its bitter end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;$8.5 billion&lt;/strong&gt; (over ₹70,000 crore) behemoth will not only be a revolutionary project but also a handshake between former rivals. So, the parties involved, Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Group, Walt Disney’s Disney, and Viacom18, would benefit massively from this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what about you? In this article, we will cover whether the deal would be beneficial for retail investors by peeking into the investor’s outlook. Let’s begin the session by knowing about the merger in depth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who, What &amp;amp; When of the Merger:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, the merger is taking place between &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ticker.finology.in/company/RELIANCE?utm_source=Insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=Articles&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Interlinking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Reliance Industries Ltd. Share Price Today, Market Cap, Price Chart, Balance Sheet&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;Reliance Industries Ltd.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Disney&lt;/strong&gt;, but a third party is also involved. It’s RIL’s media arm, &lt;strong&gt;Viacom18&lt;/strong&gt;. So, if you look at the stake division of the to-be forming entity, it would be something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;reliance Disney merger &quot; height=&quot;581&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/77ba8043df154a6fad8beb934e5084ef.png&quot; width=&quot;864&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will happen here is that by investing around &lt;strong&gt;₹11,500 crore&lt;/strong&gt;, RIL, through its media arm Viacom18, will combine its digital assets with Disney&#39;s India business to form a joint venture, aka JV, into Star India Private Limited. RIL will primarily control this joint venture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nita Ambani &lt;/strong&gt;has been appointed as the Chairperson of the joint venture, and&lt;strong&gt; Uday Shankar&lt;/strong&gt;, Co-founder of Bodhi Tree Systems, which holds a stake in Viacom18, will serve as the Vice Chairperson and provide overall strategic leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Reliance and Disney were tough competitors for Indian Premier League (&lt;strong&gt;IPL&lt;/strong&gt;) rights. Reliance won the TV broadcasting rights battle from 2023 to 2027 at an online bid.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting turn of events, isn&#39;t it that this merger has succeeded in bringing former rivals together? 🤗&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the “&lt;strong&gt;who&lt;/strong&gt;” of the scenario is clear, let’s see the “&lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt;” of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What&#39;s Merging?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The merger was announced in late 2023, and here’s a list of the channels and platforms included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a. TV Channels: &lt;/strong&gt;The deal combines a vast network of channels across genres. Reliance brings &lt;strong&gt;Colors&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;StarPlus&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Star Sports&lt;/strong&gt; channels, while Disney adds popular channels like&lt;strong&gt; Disney XD&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;National Geographic&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b. Streaming Services:&lt;/strong&gt; JioCinema from Reliance joins &lt;strong&gt;Disney+ Hotstar&lt;/strong&gt; to create a powerhouse streaming platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c. Content Libraries: &lt;/strong&gt;The merger combines Disney&#39;s global content library with Reliance&#39;s regional content and the highly coveted&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/economy/economic-impact-of-ipl?utm_source=Insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=Articles&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Interlinking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;Indian Premier League (IPL)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain media assets from Disney’s side may also get involved in the deal after receiving regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;When will the JV Officially Form?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per sources, the Reliance-Disney JV is supposed to form in the &lt;strong&gt;4th quarter of 2024&lt;/strong&gt; or the&lt;strong&gt; 1st quarter of 2025&lt;/strong&gt;. The parties involved signed binding definitive agreements, and essential preparations have begun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Impact on the Media Sector&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formation of such a significant media entity is bound to have upsides. But there are a few downsides that might impact both the media sector &amp;amp; investors like you and me. Let’s see what these possible effects could be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Positive Impacts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the silver lining for the merger:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;a. Market Dominance:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts predict the combined entity will capture nearly &lt;strong&gt;50% of the Indian streaming market share&lt;/strong&gt;. This dominance surpasses any existing player in the sector, even the now cancelled &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/business/zee-sony-merger-deal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Zee-Sony Merger Deal : What’s beyond the hype?&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;Zee-Sony&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; merger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newly forming JV could create a significant competitor for &lt;strong&gt;Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Amazon Prime Video&lt;/strong&gt;, and local players. As always, Reliance Industries is ready to wreak havoc in yet another sector by simply entering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;b. Financial Muscle:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The merger brings together Reliance, a top company with enormous &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/entrepreneurship/most-profitable-companies-in-india?utm_source=Insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=Articles&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Interlinking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Companies with large profit growth in India&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;profit growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Disney, a global media giant. The combined financial resources create a powerhouse with the potential to outspend competitors on content acquisition and production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;c. Content Reach:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The merger unites Disney&#39;s global library with Reliance&#39;s strong regional content and the crown jewel - IPL rights. This content span surpasses that of any other company in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subscribers can expect a wider variety of content, with Hollywood blockbusters from Disney alongside popular Indian shows and live sports. This merger sounds amazing from an entertainment perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;d. Price Changes:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The merger might lead to higher subscription costs due to reduced competition. However, there&#39;s also a possibility of consolidation, leading to cost efficiencies and potentially even bundled subscription options in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/entrepreneurship/truth-behind-jio?utm_source=Insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=Articles&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Interlinking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Story of Jio&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example. &lt;strong&gt;RIL’s telecom subsidiary&lt;/strong&gt; helped India become a digital nation with its reduced data prices (free subscription initially) and large data packs. The result? 👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Internet Users in the World&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/2549363b54014afba60a83ec4b6fc08c.png&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Source: Data Reportal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India is now the &lt;strong&gt;2nd nation&lt;/strong&gt; with the highest number of internet users in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Negative Impacts &amp;amp; Uncertainties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With light, there comes darkness and here are the supposed downsides of this merger:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;a. Regulatory Hurdles:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The merger might face scrutiny in terms of regulatory compliance, just like the Zee-Sony merger did. Yes, the main issue there was its executives, but certain parameters are set in the market to ensure fair competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this merger, it is clear that a massive chunk of competition would shift to the new entity, causing major losses for competitors. So, Reliance-Disney may face troubles from the watchdog Competition Commission of India (CCI) due to potential antitrust concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the CCI mandates asset sales or other concessions, it could impact the venture&#39;s overall profitability or even reject it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;b. Impact on Smaller Players:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergence of a media giant could put pressure on more minor streaming services and studios. This could indirectly affect investors who hold shares in these companies. That means you and I may bear losses. I have discussed this pointer in detail further ahead in the article. So, keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;c. Higher Subscription Costs:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts believe the merger could reduce competition, giving the combined entity more power to raise subscription prices. This is true for both traditional TV and streaming services (JioCinema and Hotstar).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;d. Reduced Bargaining Power for Advertisers:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a larger market share, the merged entity might have more leverage when negotiating advertising rates with companies. This could potentially lead to higher advertising costs, impacting businesses owned by retail investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;e. Reduced Competition:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Zee-Sony merger had gone through, it would have created another major competitor in the Indian media landscape. With Zee-Sony out of the picture, the Reliance-Disney merger faces less immediate competition, potentially making regulatory approval smoother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JV will have over&lt;strong&gt; 750 million viewers across India&lt;/strong&gt; and will also cater to the Indian &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/reliance-disney-merger-details#&quot; title=&quot;Diaspora refers to a scattered population that shares a common heritage or origin but resides outside of their traditional homeland. These scattered communities can be found all around the world.&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;diaspora&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Investor Outlook:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time to analyse the impact this merger could have on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ticker.finology.in/sector?utm_source=Insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=Articles&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Interlinking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;investing sector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Simple-minded people would think that Reliance Industries would top the charts in terms of stock momentum, but there are multiple factors to be taken into consideration here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Reliance-Disney merger announcement in late 2023, RIL&#39;s stock price has shown some fluctuations. It&#39;s difficult to isolate whether any bullish runs were solely due to the merger news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, the stock market is influenced by various factors, including overall market trends, company performance, and investor sentiment. Let’s see the two perspectives in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ticker.finology.in/investor?utm_source=Insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=Articles&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Interlinking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;investor’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sector regarding the merger:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Reliance Shareholders:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without major competition, the Reliance-Disney merger has a clearer path to capturing a larger market share, potentially making it a more attractive proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A successful merger could lead to a more substantial media business for Reliance, potentially boosting its stock price. If the merger leads to a stronger media and entertainment business under Reliance, it could boost the company&#39;s stock price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Retail Investors:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact is less clear. Higher subscription costs could strain budgets, while Reliance&#39;s share price performance will depend on the JV&#39;s success. If you look at the 6-month graph of RIL, you will see an &lt;strong&gt;absolute return of 17.5%&lt;/strong&gt; and the upward momentum seems to be coming from the beginning of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;RIL Stock Movement&quot; height=&quot;618&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/ca6424d65562494393ec9b2229b3188f.png&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ticker.finology.in/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Finology Ticker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors in smaller media companies might also be affected by the increased competition. In short, there are going to be fluctuations in the market surrounding this merger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take advantage of this partnership, make sure to keep an eye on the merger’s ongoing progress. If any one of the regulatory bodies rejects it, then there could be a possibility of the merger’s failure. This will majorly bring a bearish run for the multiple related companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, forming this entity could benefit the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ticker.finology.in/sector/advertising-media?utm_source=Insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=Articles&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Interlinking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;media sector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, bringing global attention to India from an even bigger angle.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;div class=&quot;w60 m-w90 t-w70&quot; id=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;div class=&quot;insidertext&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;According to a recent report, the fashion market in India is all set to experience significant growth at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11-12%. By the year 2025, it can reach an estimated market share of $115-125 billion, which is close to&lt;strong&gt; ₹10,25,000 crore&lt;/strong&gt;, more than Mukesh Ambani&#39;s net worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if I challenged you to compete against the most popular high-end brands in India, including Mango, Zara, and H&amp;amp;M? It&#39;s vital to notice that someone has already entered the competition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is none other than &quot;&lt;strong&gt;THE BIG PLAYER&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; Reliance Industries, whose founder, the billionaire Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, wants to cater to the high-end demands of the Indian luxury market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing the contender, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;AZORTE,&quot; &lt;/strong&gt;which aims to capture everyone&#39;s attention. Let&#39;s examine how it competes with&amp;nbsp;luxury brands in the Indian Market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About AZORTE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 29 September 2022, Reliance Industries Ltd&#39;s retail unit launched its first in-house premium fashion &amp;amp; lifestyle store chain, Azorte, in Bengaluru, which is spread around 18,000 square feet. Presently, Azorte operates seven stores in various Indian cities, including Mumbai, Pune, Gurugram &amp;amp; others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Mr Akhilesh Prasad, CEO of Reliance Retail, the company plans to open 40 stores, which will contribute 15% incremental revenue to Reliance Retail&#39;s fashion and lifestyle business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company states that the premium brand&#39;s primary focus is to provide a seamless tech-enabled journey to its end consumers. The extensive tech-enabled special features include mobile checkout, smart trial rooms, fashion-discovery stations, and self-checkout kiosks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a snapshot of an Azorte Store that has opened in Navi Mumbai, spanning approximately 15,000 square feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Categories:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;Azorte is not limited to being just a clothing store. Currently, it offers a wide range of accessories, beauty products, and footwear to cater to the vast demands coming from millennials and Gen-Z.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue Projections:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;Every company projects an estimated revenue value to attract investors; this brand is no exception.&lt;br&gt;
In the coming three years, the company expects to contribute 15-20% of its total revenue to the lifestyle and fashion businesses from its latest ventures. The company witnessed revenue growth of 3x during the first quarter of FY2023. Reliance Retail has reported gross revenue of &lt;strong&gt;₹58,554 crore&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company will also be focusing on creating employment. It will generate around 2,500 jobs as more stores keep opening up. Each store will employ about 100 employees, according to a statement by Mr. Prasad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the fashion segment, Reliance Group is also planning a major merger in its Media &amp;amp; Entertainment sector. A merger between &lt;strong&gt;Disney&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Viacom18&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Reliance&lt;/strong&gt; is on the horizon.&lt;br&gt;
Check out the inside details of the merger from the article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/reliance-disney-merger-details&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India&#39;s Largest Media Entity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How Will Azorte Compete With Zara or H&amp;amp;M?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliance Industries is well known for outperforming its competitors, be it in the telecom sector, consumer durables, lifestyle, or fashion businesses.&lt;br&gt;
The launch of JIO demonstrates how Reliance Industries destroyed brands such as AIRCEL, TATA Docomo, BSNL, and others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Reliance Group is once again strategizing to destroy its competitors in the premium fashion and lifestyle segment. However, this time, they aim to achieve their goal by establishing the most technologically advanced stores throughout India.&amp;nbsp;Look at the below-mentioned reasons to understand how Azorte&amp;nbsp;is outshining its competitors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fully Automated Stores: &lt;/strong&gt;Azorte&amp;nbsp;is introducing fully automated stores where customers can shop with minimal human interactions. When you take any article with you into the smart trial rooms, it will automatically detect the product and display it on the screens. This system works on &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/reliance-retail-azorte-store#&quot; title=&quot;With radio-frequency identification, tags attached to items are automatically recognised and tracked using electromagnetic fields.&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RFID (radio frequency identification)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt;technology.&amp;nbsp;There&#39;s an intelligent self-checkout kiosk, so customers can eliminate standing in queues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitive Pricing: &lt;/strong&gt;Despite marketing their brand as a premium lifestyle brand, they have kept the prices low compared to Zara or H&amp;amp;M to counter competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super premium experience: &lt;/strong&gt;In case the size of any apparel does not fit you, you can ask for another size from inside the trial room, and their employees will get that for you. How cool does that sound?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low Staff: &lt;/strong&gt;As Azorte&amp;nbsp;will be operated in a fully automated space, there will be minimal staff present in the store. You can ignore those awful conversations while making a purchase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many facts and figures! Let me present you with an idea in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Public&#39;s Reaction to AZORTE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India is a democratic nation, and everyone can express their views on anything. We get to know how a brand is performing through the public&#39;s reaction. However, their reaction to the brand was different from what was expected by the company. Some statements by the public are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are not satisfied with the quality and designs of the apparel in Azorte&amp;nbsp;stores. They have shown their dissatisfaction via Instagram comments over reels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Instagram user says some of its products are overpriced for fast fashion products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Azorte&amp;nbsp;will contribute more to the country&#39;s unemployment level, a user commented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brand loyalty is what makes Azorte&amp;nbsp;tough to compete with ZARA and H&amp;amp;M.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azorte is all set to revolutionize fast, premium fashion and lifestyle products. With significant capital expenditure, the Reliance Group is dedicated to providing its customers with a highly advanced tech experience in its stores. Smart trial rooms, luxurious interiors, and self-checkout kiosks are some of the ways it is competing with other players in the market. Azorte, led by the daughter of the Ambanis, Isha Ambani, is determined to provide&amp;nbsp;stiff competition to brands such as Zara, H&amp;amp;M, and Mango.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azorte&amp;nbsp;was launched in the previous year, and although 11 months have already passed, the general public seems unexcited about it. The public&#39;s reaction to Azorte was not up to the mark expected by the Reliance Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will Azorte&amp;nbsp;be able to establish itself as a successful, fast-growing premium fashion and lifestyle brand? This question remains unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;div class=&quot;w60 m-w90 t-w70&quot; id=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;div class=&quot;insidertext&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;The entity famous for being the know-it-all in our world, the entity that everyone relies on for both big and small difficulties, has its bad days as well. Google, the search engine handling more than &lt;strong&gt;3.5 billion&lt;/strong&gt; searches on a daily basis, is everywhere. It doesn&#39;t come as a surprise since among the 8.0 billion people on Earth (as per Worldometer), 30% or so are using its assistance multiple times a day. This makes me wonder; if everyone on the planet is turning towards Google for their troubles, then who helps Google find a way out of tough spots? And though difficult to believe, Google is in a tough spot in India.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google’s User Billing Policy is facing harsh setbacks in India as it reportedly breaks CCI&#39;s set regulations. The Competition Commission of India has already charged Google with a fine of &lt;strong&gt;₹1,337 crore&lt;/strong&gt; for anti-competitive practices in Android devices, which has been further discussed in brief below. Apart from this, Google is also accused of unfairly taking advantage of its dominating position in the tech market with its 30% commission charge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the know-it-all entity we rely on is hell-bent on converting its God-like standing in the market to green bills with astounding speed. But, to protect the interests of Indian companies, both the government and dedicated committees are planning to take matters into their own hands. This article is about further troubles that await Google across Indian waters as well as the outcome of the antitrust cases it is fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Might of Google Challenged by India&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various Indian startups have formed a union against Google to abolish its payment system as they found it to be unfairly excessive. Startups like Matrimony.com, Shaadi.com, Unacademy, etc. came together and created the Alliance of Digital India Foundation, also known as &lt;em&gt;Atmanirbhar&lt;/em&gt; Digital India Foundation (ADIF). True to its namesake, ADIF envisions making the Indian startup ecosystem the most preferred startup destination for the world by 2030.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just think about it, Indian startup companies were so fed up with the continuous rampages that tech giants like Google and Facebook were wreaking in the nation that they formed a unit against it. Why does this feel like a recap of the nation&#39;s pre-independence days to me? 😬&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;278&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/0633b4e9f4fa4ca38b2148de1a3517d9.gif&quot; width=&quot;498&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&#39;s not just me who&#39;s reminiscing the &lt;em&gt;Lagaan&lt;/em&gt; movie dialogues while researching Google&#39;s dominance parade in India. ADIF has named its fight against Google&#39;s billing policy as the &quot;Lagaan policy&quot; because of the unfair pricing the titan is asking them to pay.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s simplify this with an example of why the startups are so adamant about rejecting this payment system despite it being revamped by Google. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a developer with a mobile app on the Google Play Store that allows in-app purchases, then a commission of &lt;strong&gt;15% to 30%&lt;/strong&gt; would have been applied. This means that if a user transaction of ₹100 takes place, then ₹30 would fall under Google&#39;s pockets (when a 30% commission is applied). As per Google&#39;s Billing Policy, the 15% commission applies to developers who earn up to $1 million in a year, whereas if the developer&#39;s revenue crosses the threshold of $1 million, a 30% commission would be applied.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commission would be applicable on every transaction for both in-app purchases, subscriptions and paid apps. Hence, the developers distributing their apps on Google Play Store would need to pay 30% of their revenue from Play once it crosses $1 million. This is a big amount for startup companies, &lt;strong&gt;₹8.19 crore&lt;/strong&gt;, give or take in INR, who are just beginning to find footing in the cutthroat market of India. Whereas it&#39;s like a drop of water in the ocean for Google, which recorded an annual revenue of $279.8 billion in 2022 which would be around ₹22893.55 Crore in INR. Talk about going BIG, guys!😮&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/phonepe-indus-appstore-launch?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internallink&amp;amp;utm_content=phonepe-indus-appstore-launch&amp;amp;utm_term=google-billing-policy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Is Google Play Facing Competition? Indus Appstore’s Entry in India&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Google Play Facing Competition?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Read the full article here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world is getting more urbanised, Google.com is the most preferred search engine and the most visited website in the world. This directly contributes to the hike Alphabet Inc. owned Google LLC has witnessed. In 2022 itself, Alphabet generated $29.06 billion, making up over 10% of its annual revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;453&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/12b723c7fd9342efb5cf5940b101de8a.png&quot; width=&quot;806&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strangest part is that most of the revenue earned by Google comes from their advertising sector, aka the &quot;Google Ads&#39;&#39; program. Remember those “Ads” or “Sponsored” links that always show up first on the search engine? Brands pay for those website links to be displayed on the top of Google to increase their traffic and lead generation. Google charges for these advertised websites, and it contributes around 80% of its total revenue generation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these big numbers, Google is stuck on its stance of &quot;take it or leave it&quot; for developers and app providers. Google is the king in the sector, as even Apple can&#39;t compete with it. Removal of apps from the Google Play Store would mean losing more than half of the consumers, which the startups and developers can&#39;t handle in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, being oppressed is not in these budding companies&#39; nature, so they have decided to keep trying to make Google submit. And with the upcoming changes in India&#39;s regulatory policies as well as the nation&#39;s future adoption of new policies, there is a high possibility Google may have to make further changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes have already started after the first announcement of the application of the User Billing Policy in 2020. Google made changes in its policy due to the resistance it faced in India. However, India is not the only nation that has raised flags against Google&#39;s tyranny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Countries with the Same Stance as India&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the recent upgrade in User Billing Policy, Google made its customers complete all in-app purchases through its in-house platform, Google Pay. Whether a user was paying through credit, debit cards, or any other banking options, every transaction was completed using Google’s payment gateway. Through this, Google cut its 15-30% commission, and the leftover amount was transferred to the respective apps&#39; developers. This in-app purchasing through Google’s payment system was opposed worldwide, including in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India is not alone in realising the monopoly Google has in the market, especially in the advertising sector. Europe, USA, UK, Australia, Japan, and South Korea have taken a stand by filing several antitrust cases against the search giant. South Korea went as far as updating its Telecommunication Business Act in August 2021, turning monopolies of Google and Apple in the app payment market illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simple words, the new law, which is also popularly known as “the Anti-Google Law”, restricts these app stores from forcing developers to choose in-app payment systems. Hence, no more commissions are to be guaranteed for the app store companies leading to a vast reduction in the revenue generated from this sector.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from South Korea, regulatory bodies from other countries have filed several cases, including the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/google-billing-policy#&quot; title=&quot;This lawsuit focuses on the exclusionary contracts Google locked with the competition, like Apple, to increase its distribution channel. One such event is the contract between Google and Apple to make Google Play Store a default feature in Apple devices.&quot;&gt;DOJ Lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, aka the United States Department of Justice lawsuit, the Shopping Comparison case in Europe, the Antitrust Scrutiny against Google in Japan, and many others. All these cases revolve around the tech titan&#39;s wish to monopolise its advertising and search services on Android devices. Many of these cases are still ongoing, but their outcome might not be in Google&#39;s favour. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing such backlash worldwide, Google finally realised the gravity of the matter and decided to settle some tension by changing its User Billing Policy. The original User Billing Policy was enacted on the prior set date of 26th April 2023. Still, instead of forcing app developers and providers to pay the 15-30% commission on in-app purchases, Google had to make certain tweaks. Let’s see what changes were made in the billing policy and whether they pacified the regulatory bodies and developers in India. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Changes&amp;nbsp;in Google&#39;s Billing Policy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After India fined Google for antitrust violations and CCI started investigating the matter presented by ADIF, Google had no option other than to rework its conditions. So, as of February 2023, Google started providing an alternative billing system alongside its in-house payment system to consumers in India. Along with this, additional alterations were made to the payment policy. By going through Google’s official website, I have noted the prime changes in the in-app payment system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change:&lt;/strong&gt; Indian users will now have the option to choose their default search engine via a choice screen that will soon start to appear when a user sets up a new Android smartphone or tablet in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explanation:&lt;/strong&gt; Google&#39;s search engine was the default feature in most Android devices. This showcased Tech Titan&#39;s strategy of making its search app a requirement for Android devices. Thus, Google was forcing the device makers and limiting consumers&#39; usability options. After antitrust cases were filed against the company in several nations, Google had no other choice but to add a user-choice feature to devices.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change:&lt;/strong&gt; User-choice billing will be available to all apps and games starting next month. Through user choice billing, developers can offer users the option to choose an alternative billing system alongside Google Play’s billing system when purchasing in-app digital content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explanation:&lt;/strong&gt; As mentioned above, Google enforced its billing system as the only payment option for in-app purchases. But, after this condition was openly opposed by startups in India as well as being outlawed by South Korea, Google had to provide optionality to developers and consumers in its play store.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change:&lt;/strong&gt; Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) will be able to license individual Google apps for pre-installation on their devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explanation:&lt;/strong&gt; There are hardly any Android smartphones present in our nation that don&#39;t have Google features and apps pre-installed. Whether it is Google Maps, Google Play Store, Google Mail, or Google Chrome, android phones contain them without an option to uninstall them. It was a great strategy for the company to reduce or, should I boldly say, remove competition altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;433&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/f30e99dc31144645af05022176dfde95.png&quot; width=&quot;769&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By seeing the above infographic for GMail&#39;s market share in terms of client preference, you can understand the dominance Google apps enjoy in the market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Further Trouble for Tech Giants in India&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, based on the above changes, Google launched its billing system in India. Despite that, first startups and now OTT platforms like Disney+, Hotstar, Voot, Zee5, SonyLIV, Manorama Max, SunNXT, and Discovery+ are not convinced. These platforms believe that a slight reduction (4% to be exact) would be a half-assed method to appease the allegations made against Google. Startups find these reductions to be no better than the original commission rate of 15-30% and are thus not ready to accept it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, even if Google somehow got away from the sharp eyes of CCI, its troubles in India are far from over. The Indian government plans to introduce certain regulations to the data protection department, many of which are already in the last phase. Digital India Act, Data Competition Bill, and Digital Personal Data Protection Bill are some policies and bills being planned by MeitY and the Finance Ministry of India. These policies would restrict the free reigns and supremacy tech giants like Google, Meta, and Apple enjoy in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already, the first draft of the Digital India Act has made its public appearance this year, and the other bills are not too far behind. Through these updates in the regulations, the Indian government is adamant about protecting its citizens’ rights and helping startups and other Indian companies to thrive within legal bounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these bills coming into effect, Google and Meta, along with other foreign-based companies, will have to bring many changes in their business models. FDI policies are working as a sound screener for foreign investments in the nation. With the addition of a properly drafted data protection regime, all monopolies and unfair advantages will be weeded out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Eager to know how many of your digital rights would be protected in the Digital India Act? Go to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/economy/digital-india-act?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internallink&amp;amp;utm_content=digital-india-act&amp;amp;utm_term=google-billing-policy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Will the Digital India Act destroy the Indian Data Ecosystem?&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for an in-depth analysis of the act.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At Google, we have been privileged to play a part in India’s embrace of technology to improve lives in three key ways: bringing access to affordable devices, building helpful and secure products to meet the evolving needs of Indian users, and partnering with India&#39;s vibrant developer community to grow and reach a global audience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first line of the blog post introducing the User Billing Policy by Google. Talk about hypocrisy! Google has been misusing its position of being at the top of the sector for its advantage for a long time now, and it&#39;s time that it stops. However, charging the company with a few million dollars won&#39;t be enough, as was apparent from prior examples around the globe. India may have to take a potent stand for its startup benefits, just like South Korea did. The upcoming policies need to incorporate details from different angles to avoid leaving loopholes for the giants to misuse. Let&#39;s hope that foundations like ADIF will be able to accomplish their goals and are not only present for fortnightly updates.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;The gaming industry has taken an unforeseen turn! An unexpected statement regarding the 28% GST rate on gaming, stole the show at the 50th GST conference. In this article, we will dive into the consequences of this move and will also discover how this unexpected turn of events will impact the industry&amp;nbsp;players, including one unfortunate company whose shares dropped significantly right after the news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it was Delta Corp who witnessed a misfortune and tasted the bitterness of a 23% share crash!📉 The news of the GST increase has seemed to hit them like a punch in their belly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing is all about making informed decisions and backing businesses that inspire confidence. In the gambling business, the only certainty is uncertainty itself 🤫. We can presume that those who invested must have properly considered their options before parting with their hard-earned cash. However, the recent collapse of the share price gave investors the taste of gambling. Imagine the thrill and suspense as they watch their fortunes disappear faster than a player&#39;s in-game credits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/5646f9dc476b4216a0ba9e8cbc6b1f38.png&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has turned into,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;168&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/bc842bbca5b440018d7bc8dc7ac33ecb.png&quot; width=&quot;299&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But wait,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Let&#39;s Know the &quot;WHY&quot;&amp;nbsp;Behind this Tax Hike.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government justified the hike by saying that it is necessary to discourage young people from gambling. However, I believe there are problems with this reasoning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the great majority of online gamblers are adults, and gambling is already prohibited for those underage. Then, there is a chance that the increase will have an impact that is opposite to what the administration is anticipating. By raising the cost of online gaming, the government is only pushing players to foreign platforms, which are exempted from the Indian tax rules. This will just make gambling more accessible to kids and take away money from the government that is needed. Probably, this can be an example of how well-intentioned policies can have unintended consequences 🤷.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most likely, the government&#39;s efforts to stop young people from betting will just promote their gambling. It appears that, as with tobacco, the government has taken a page from the &lt;strong&gt;&quot;How to Discourage Consumption&quot; &lt;/strong&gt;manual. Oh, that was such a brilliant strategy! (Notice the subtle sarcasm in this😉.) Did it really result in a considerable reduction in consumption? Let&#39;s just say that we aren&#39;t entirely certain that the past will repeat itself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on, it was expected that the government would implement regulatory adjustments after hearing the news. It&#39;s important to remember that the initial fee was only for the platform. However, the most recent development includes taking it into account as a whole; allow me to explain this using an example.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;width:500px&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial scenario:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A person is taking a bet of ₹100 and the platform fee is at ₹20&lt;br&gt;
So the GST calculated was 18% of ₹20 = ₹3.6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;width:500px&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current scenario:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A person is taking a bet of ₹100 and the platform fee is at ₹20&lt;br&gt;
Now the GST calculated will be 28% of the bet amount, that is ₹100 = ₹28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see the significant rise in the cost that the user will now have to bear and that is why this downfall in the stock prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s know in detail if this act of government is simply a bump on the road to fortune or a concern for the investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Games Market: Trends and Opportunities of Delta&amp;nbsp;Corp Ltd.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of gamers worldwide is growing steadily. It is predicted that by 2025, there will be around &lt;strong&gt;500 million users &lt;/strong&gt;engaged in online gaming, making it the third-largest segment of the Indian media and entertainment industry. This growth is fueled by the adoption of 5G technology and the shift from basic phones to smartphones.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global games market experienced a little decline in revenue in 2022, with a 5.1% decrease from the previous year. The industry generated US$182.9 billion in revenue, which is close to ₹15 lakh crore. However, there is hope for the future because it is predicted that the global gaming market will recover and reach a new high of US$ 206.4 billion which is &lt;strong&gt;₹16,92,480 crore &lt;/strong&gt;by &lt;strong&gt;2025&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;452&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/58b7671ee2304b29b520f112a75daed7.png&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is evident that the gaming industry has strong growth potential. Let&#39;s examine the sector in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual states in India are responsible for regulating gambling activity, both offline and online. Only states have the power to enact regulations governing gambling on their own soil. Goa and Sikkim are the only two exceptions to this norm. These states have legalised offline gaming, but only under the conditions set forth by each state&#39;s government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a licensing mechanism, the Goa Gambling Act permits five-star hotels to provide &quot;&lt;strong&gt;games of electronic amusement or slot machines&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; in Goa. Under particular licensing restrictions, they may also provide table games and other types of gaming on offshore vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States like &lt;em&gt;Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Assam, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Odisha&lt;/em&gt;, however, forbid the playing of any game for money. Games of skill&amp;nbsp;are also not considered an exception in these states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Delta Corp Ltd.: Dealing Fun and Fortunes!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operating in Sikkim and Goa, Delta Corp Limited is a well-known player in the casino gambling sector. The organisation offers a wide variety of gaming forms, such as live, electronic, and internet games. It possesses licenses for both onshore and off-shore operations, allowing it to add hospitality assets to its casino activities. In February 2020, the firm opened a casino at the Hotel Marriott in Kathmandu, Nepal, in an effort to broaden its global presence. Additionally, Delta Corp entered the online gambling industry in 2017 by purchasing Adda52.com, a well-known Indian online gaming portal. This action was taken to improve its standing in the Indian gambling sector.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company generates revenue through online skill-based games like poker, rummy, and fantasy sports, which are played for real money in many Indian states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Here is a list of the mentioned casinos:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Deltin Royale, Goa&lt;br&gt;
2. Deltin JAQK, Goa&lt;br&gt;
3. Kings Casino (Deltin Caravela), Goa&lt;br&gt;
4. Deltin Suites Casino, Goa&lt;br&gt;
5. Deltin Zuri, Goa&lt;br&gt;
6. Deltin Denzong, Sikkim&lt;br&gt;
7. Deltin Casino, Kathmandu, Nepal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The online gaming platforms operated by Deltatech Gaming Limited are:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Adda52.com&lt;br&gt;
2. Adda52Rummy.com&lt;br&gt;
3. Adda.games&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Under their hospitality segment, they have two hotels:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. The Deltin, Daman&lt;br&gt;
2. Deltin Suites, Goa&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SWOTting It Out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s analyze the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats of Delta Corp Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;India&#39;s top gaming business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First-mover advantage in a relatively unpopulated sector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wide client base and diverse gaming platform portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team with extensive gaming experience and talent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presence throughout a range of gaming formats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weakness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business specialisation in particular regions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing non-core hospitality businesses presents difficulties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming licenses are subject to limitations and restrictions in many places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rapid expansion of skill-based games among millennials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indian society is becoming more accepting of gaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Untapped potential for expanding geographically and obtaining new licenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negative regulatory changes that have an impact on the gaming sector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intense competition within the gaming sector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decreased demand as a result of the recession and reduction in discretionary spending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential regulatory barriers that could cause delays in getting casino licenses, such as in Daman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Financial Overview of Delta Corp Ltd.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lifting of lockdown restrictions and the gradual reopening of the economy played a significant role in driving increased guest visits and revenue growth in the casinos. The desire for such experiences grew when people recovered the opportunity to access entertainment establishments, especially casinos. More people went to the casinos as a result, increasing revenue for the casino gaming industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In FY 2022-23, the revenue breakdown by segment is as follows:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Casino Gaming segment: &lt;/strong&gt;Revenues increased by 86.54% to ₹1,010.65 crore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Skill Gaming category: &lt;/strong&gt;Revenues increased by 18.16%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hospitality segment: &lt;/strong&gt;Revenues increased by 25.08%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount earned from the segments stated above is displayed in the table below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table border=&quot;2&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(in ₹ crore)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2022&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casino Gaming&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;439.91&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;809.96&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online skill gaming&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;137.22&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;162.17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;39&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;48.64&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Revenue from contract with customer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;616.13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1020.77&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The net profit climbed in FY 2022–23, rising from &lt;strong&gt;₹66.99 crore&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;to &lt;strong&gt;₹261.37 crore&lt;/strong&gt;. Higher revenues and optimised expenses, which show increased operational efficiency and profitability, can be used to explain this significant growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ratio of net profit to total sales, known as the net profit ratio, rose from 10.87% in 2022 to 25.61% in 2023. This suggests that revenue is being used more effectively to produce profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, in FY 2023, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/stock-ratios/return-on-capital-employed?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internallink&amp;amp;utm_content=roce&amp;amp;utm_term=deltacorp-business-model&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;What is Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)?&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return on Capital Employed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (ROCE) increased from 4.71% to almost 17%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increase in overall revenue, which was sufficient to offset the increased operational costs and tax charges, is responsible for this improvement. Increased profitability and efficient use of the company&#39;s capital are suggested by the greater ROCE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) - Finology Insider&quot; height=&quot;452&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/794fca3c77d941ab8621d5827273976d.png&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company&#39;s financial performance demonstrates its debt-free status, solid cash position, higher return on equity, and improved turnover ratios, all of which point to good growth and financial stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graph below illustrates the rise in &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/stock-ratios/understanding-return-on-equity?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internallink&amp;amp;utm_content=roe&amp;amp;utm_term=deltacorp-business-model&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Return on Equity: Definition, Formula, Calculation, Example and Importance&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return on Equity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(ROE),&amp;nbsp;which is due to the very straightforward fact that the number of operational days in the current year has increased relative to the previous year, increasing total revenue, which is then offset by rising operational costs and tax expenses. As a result, return on equity has increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Return on Equity&amp;nbsp;(ROE) - Finology Insider&quot; height=&quot;452&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/b38519974e6a41aeb7dc717ed8cb5f39.png&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Risks Involved in the Business and the Ways of Mitigation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, we will explore the risks involved in detail and examine how the company plans to mitigate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Regulatory Risk:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;In this area, there is a lot of government interference, which suggests that if the company doesn&#39;t follow the laws, its commercial operations may suffer. Licenses might be suspended, fines could pile up, and even criminal penalties could come knocking.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
👉 The business claims that it has developed strong contacts with local government agencies and that it takes great care to ensure that all regulatory requirements are met.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2. Peer Risk:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;There are numerous new players who develop better technology or a more effective marketing plan, which poses a danger to the company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 They have an advantage because they are a dominant player. They assert that both their goods and the content are of a high standard. They increase user engagement and experience to keep a competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Acquisition related Risk:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Any firm faces a challenging task when making an acquisition, and if these risks are not managed, it could negatively affect the company&#39;s cash flow, operating performance, and financial situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 The business carefully selects its targets in order to reduce this risk, and it also uses an evaluation standard to make the purchase more impartial and lower the possibility of a mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Geographic Concentration Risk:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The&amp;nbsp;company is overly dependent on a single industry and geographic area because it is so narrowly concentrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 The company&#39;s main business is gaming, but they have also expanded into the hospitality industry and now operate in Sikkim, Nepal, and Daman in addition to Goa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Inflation Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; It is obvious that rising inflation has an effect on the purchasing power of the firm&#39;s clients, and in this industry, where human capital is the major expense, it may lead to unexpected wage inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 Due to the adoption of best practices and provision of lucrative compensation, they have a high rate of staff retention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Unanticipated Event Impact Risk:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;In all businesses, there is no anticipated danger. Events such as a global epidemic and Black Swan events can have a significant effect on the company&#39;s hospitality industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 The management must keep a careful eye on the economy&#39;s future and its level of uncertainty if this problem is to be solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we conclude this article, it&#39;s evident that the rate hike will have a significant consequence, leading to the unfortunate downfall of Delta. It&#39;s important to take into account the total effect, even though it might only last a short while. Even though the company&#39;s financial performance might increase, it&#39;s crucial to recognise that the industry has inherent risks, notably regulatory concerns. Temporary swings are normal in the dynamic market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s crucial for long-term investors to evaluate the entire company rather than making snap decisions based only on stock price swings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some investors could be forced to reconsider their choices, others might see it as a chance to make a return. After all, strategies may be changed in both gaming and finance, and patience can result in redemption. Despite the difficulties, there is a portion of the population that will continue to gamble regardless of the situation, guaranteeing that the industry expands. Although there will likely be short-term negative effects, it&#39;s important to recognise that the corporation can immediately pass the tax burden on to customers, which has a direct impact on demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term investors can navigate the market&#39;s ups and downs by adopting a global perspective and understanding that a company&#39;s short-term decline may not accurately reflect its true potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hey, while you wait, why not engage in a different kind of gambling?🧐&lt;br&gt;
Just kidding, don&#39;t gamble. It&#39;s a bad habit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Zee Group has always been talented in making alliances with the top players in the field. In 1992, they entered the entertainment world by joining hands with the &lt;strong&gt;Star TV group&lt;/strong&gt;. With this collaboration, the Zee group received a transponder from satellite network AsiaSat on a lease which helped them enjoy a &lt;strong&gt;market share of 64%&lt;/strong&gt; in the satellite sector by 1994.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years! That&#39;s how long Zee Group needed to become the dominant player in the market. And now, everything the group created seems to be in danger of falling apart because of one bad decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zee Group made several contributions to the entertainment industry with the incorporation of &lt;strong&gt;Zee Telefilms Ltd.&lt;/strong&gt; (former name of Zee Entertainment Enterprises). We remember watching shows on the Zee TV channel like &lt;em&gt;Pavitra Rishta&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Sa Re Ga Ma Pa&lt;/em&gt;, which were super popular and, quite frankly, way too long. Today, Zee Group has around &lt;strong&gt;45 channels&lt;/strong&gt; broadcasting worldwide. Apart from becoming a key player in the broadcasting industry, Zee Group was the first one to start the nation&#39;s first amusement park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But things are not going as chummy for the conglomerate company as it was, 🎶 if I may quote Harry Styles!With the chaos of managerial authorities being barred by SEBI regulators and share prices sinking down, the merger delayed for three years now is now not going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, before the many unreserved stops in the Zee-Sony merger train, how was the Zee group coping? 🚊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Zee-Sony Merger Meets Deadend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Zee-Sony merger, once touted as a &lt;strong&gt;$10 billion (around ₹83,000 crore) &lt;/strong&gt;media powerhouse, is now over.&lt;span style=&quot;color:#0e101a&quot;&gt; Sony has reportedly forwarded certain conditions, one of which includes&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#0e101a&quot;&gt;the removal of Punit Goenka as CEO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#0e101a&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the new entity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several factors have thrown the deal off the table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Deadline Discord:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial timeline for completion was September 2023, later extended to December 22nd. Now, Zee seeks another extension, but Sony remains hesitant. This lack of agreement throws the future of the merger into doubt. Delays and legal battles have pushed up costs for both parties. Every extension necessitates renegotiation, potentially impacting the financial viability of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Leadership Limbo:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disagreements on who will lead the merged entity have surfaced. While the initial plan named &lt;strong&gt;Punit Goenka&lt;/strong&gt; (Zee CEO) as head, but the regulatory allegations and other troubles from the ones in power have caused resistance in this decision. The power struggle as of now complicates matters further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Regulatory Roadblocks:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal hurdles have plagued the merger. SEBI&#39;s investigation into Zee and a court order barring Goenka from holding directorships added significant delays. While some hurdles have been overcome, their lingering impact creates uncertainty. This was also one of the biggest reason behind the delay in the merger achieving fruition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broader economic climate plays a role too. With a potential global recession looming, Sony may be re-evaluating the merits of such a large expenditure in a risky market. While the merger isn&#39;t entirely dead (as of now), it&#39;s undeniably struggling. Continued uncertainty, leadership disputes, and external factors could ultimately spell its doom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sony backed out of the merger due to the many delays from Zee Entertainment and the multiple roadblocks, and demanded a major fine. Zee had to pay &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;₹&lt;/span&gt;432 crore to Sony&#39;s Indian arm Culver Max Entertainment &lt;/strong&gt;as part of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not short to say that Zee has been having a difficult couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now read, what led to the reputed multinational conglomerate&#39;s interior wars with creditors and shareholders ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The First Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First come, first serve. This fact applies every time and to everyone, especially in the business world. Yes, there are challenges to doing something no one has done before, but if done right, then the profits are unprecedented. Zee Group, aka Essel Group, did many things before anyone else and did it wonderfully. The launch of Zee TV in 1992, India&#39;s first Hindi language satellite channel, and the establishment of India&#39;s first amusement park, EsselWorld, in 2001 are a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, the root cause for human downfall, &quot;greed&quot;, struck the entertainment giant so badly that it is hardly coping. And like every damsel in distress, Zee Entertainment Enterprises is now clinging onto Sony to find its way back to the top of the world. This is not the first time the news of the future merger between both companies has helped Zee maintain its high profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sony&#39;s India Arm, Sony Pictures Networks India, has been shouldering the burdens of Zee Group since the union talks began in 2021. Many experts believed that the merger would be a bad step for both Sony and Zee due to the non-uniformed balance the financials would entail. Apparently, Sony would be chipping in the maximum part of the cash in the deal, around $1.5-1.6 billion, which would be about &lt;strong&gt;₹11,000-12,000 crore&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this deal, the once-in-power Chandra family will regain control due to getting new shares with the merger. With this, Punit Goenka, the CEO &amp;amp; Managing Director, will be able to manage the merged entity more easily. This matter is not sitting well with shareholders like Invesco as they don’t find Punit Goenka as the managerial position good for the merger’s health. And so, Invesco filed a lawsuit against Zee in January 2022 to block the merger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, Invesco ended up losing the lawsuit, and the path for the merger became clear with approval from the Competition Commission of India (CCI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sony To The Rescue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would argue that being a prominent player in the entertainment sector would give a substantial advantage to the group, right? But it hasn&#39;t been the case with Zee for years now. Let&#39;s compare &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ticker.finology.in/company/ZEEL?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=insider-interlinking&amp;amp;utm_content=zee-sony-merger&amp;amp;utm_term=ZEEL&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. Share Price Today, Market Cap, Price Chart, Balance Sheet&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;Zee Entertainment Enterprises&#39; share price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; before and after the announcement of the Zee-Sony&amp;nbsp;merger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Let&#39;s compare Zee Entertainment Enterprises&#39; share price before and after the announcement of the Zee-Sony&amp;nbsp;merger.&quot; height=&quot;411&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/d6388c28e2644f1b99feae9d8267541a.png&quot; width=&quot;543&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As visible in the infographic above, the company&#39;s share price was ₹168.05 at the end of August 2021, whereas the year ended with a 112% increase in stock price. The breaking of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/business/zee-sony-merger-deal?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=insider-interlinking&amp;amp;utm_content=zee-sony-merger&amp;amp;utm_term=zee-sony-merger-deal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Zee-Sony Merger Deal : What&#39;s beyond the hype?&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zee-Sony merger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in September 2021 led to a giant leap in the price chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only this, but the company also started to reduce its &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/zee-sony-merger#&quot; title=&quot;The percentage of the promoter&#39;s shares that have been pledged as collateral for a loan is the promoter pledge percent. The pledge percent is calculated by dividing the number of pledged shares by the total number of promoter shares.&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;promoter pledge percentage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from 90% to 5.38% in September 2021. And we all know what started in September of 2021, right? You guessed it right! The overtly famous Zee-Sony merger talk began this month, helping the Zee group find a way to handle the unstable financial condition.&lt;br&gt;
The mess that Subhash Chandra, the Zee Group promoter, made by taking huge loans to enter the infrastructure sector was cleaned up with the arrival of the merger news. The investment ended a disaster for the Essel Group, bringing debts worth billions for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expectation of a profitable merger, which would likely boost the company&#39;s revenue, raised confidence in lenders. With the combination of debt restructuring and equity dilution, Subhash Chandra reduced the promoter pledge percentage from 90% to around 5%. This was a positive development for Zee as they improved their financial standing by paying off a debt of 383.30 Crores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, when the company sees a pitiful CAGR return of &lt;strong&gt;-17.7%&lt;/strong&gt; (as per five-year data), the merger with multinational conglomerate Sony seems to be the last saving grace for Zee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;when the company sees a pitiful CAGR return of -17.7% (as per five-year data), the merger with multinational conglomerate Sony seems to be the last saving grace for Zee.&quot; height=&quot;280&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/cfd0e8f503f64d0c9d4e69eb14774a32.png&quot; width=&quot;430&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts in the matter believe that the pathway for the merger would soon be cleared without any hiccups by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/business/national-company-law-tribunal-nclt?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=insider-interlinking&amp;amp;utm_content=zee-sony-merger&amp;amp;utm_term=national-company-law-tribunal-nclt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;NCLT: Understanding National Company Law Tribunal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, amidst all the ongoing drama, the Chandra family would definitely be manifesting plans to capitalise as much as possible from this deal. After all, the role of protagonist to their damsel has been played by Sony for three consecutive years now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only question arises whether the Zee group&#39;s founders will get their original power back or will the ban placed on Subash Chandra and Punit Goenka by SEBI regulators be a start to the decline of the little control they exhibit. Along with the country, Insider would be watching for the conclusion to this mega drama with you all.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;An app that changed the concept of free time for people, Instagram is now a big money-making medium for many. Users with large followers on their Instagram accounts are now called influencers as they provide information about a certain sector using reels, posts, IGTV, or stories. This popularity of the social media platform launched in 2010 became so eminent that its parent company, Meta, decided to monetise it. Today, I will take you on a tour of what Instagram&#39;s new feature, &quot;Subscriptions&quot;, entails and how it will affect you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Yes, popular Instagram account handlers were still making money with collaborations, affiliate marketing and sponsorships from businesses. But, Instagram on its own was not identified as a direct source of income. It merely played the role of a medium for businesses to promote their products &amp;amp; services and for influencers to earn money by promoting on their page.&lt;br&gt;
Seeing the potential the platform has in the upcoming time, Meta is testing a new (Cough....Copied..Cough) approach to earn more revenue from their popular social media platform. Yes, we are talking about the brand-new Instagram Paid Subscription plan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;In this article, I have included answers to the most common and unusual queries you might come across about this development. From basic ones like:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;What do these Instagram subscriptions entail? How are they beneficial for creators and subscribers?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;What are the eligibility requirements?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;What’s the price range for subscriptions? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Are they available in India?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;To the queries, no one talks about;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;What would one get by subscribing to a creator’s account?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Is the subscription feature really needed? And more!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Keep your Instagram scrolling aside for a few minutes (Just 5-7 minutes, I promise! 😇) and scroll through this article to know A-Z of Instagram Subscriptions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;What Do Instagram Paid Subscriptions Entail?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Subscriptions, the word which is today known to even 10-year-olds, is now a part of Instagram as well. Just like &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/twitter-elon-musk?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=interlinking&amp;amp;utm_content=instagram-subscriptions&amp;amp;utm_term=twitter-elon-musk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;How Elon Musk is Reshaping Twitter: The Full Story&quot;&gt;Elon Musk’s Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Instagram has also decided to try the funda, which is a direct line for even more revenue generation than the $51.4 billion they achieved in 2023. With an estimated mark of 37 million global influencers, this strategy may work surprisingly well for the platform.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;So, for all the creators reading this article, the Instagram subscription is a new method to earn more money using the social media platform. All one needs to do is add the “Subscribe” option for their profile from their “professional dashboard” and select an amount of money that users would need to pay to subscribe to your exclusive content. Then, those subscribers would receive a purple badge next to their Instagram profile, which is a white crown in a purple patch, showcasing their status as a subscriber.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;389&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/d39cd196a4f7478db0d8511be4ea4344.png&quot; width=&quot;171&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Along with the badge, the subscribers would also receive other perks by subscribing to their desired creators. From exclusive content to a quick peek inside the influencer&#39;s minds via subscriber-only group chats. It would be like having a groupies’ chat room with frequent replies from the influential figure for whom the groupies gather. Imagine getting the chance to interact with your favourite actor/actress or any influencer you admire. Instagram grasped this hidden desire of fans and turned it into a reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;275&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/19d9a6093f4947a393a531ece6a3901e.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;This new program is still in its testing stage, so it is available for creators to initiate the subscriber program in the USA only. But Instagram users from different countries, like India, can still subscribe to any influencer they want. All one needs to do is click on the subscribe option on the particular influencer’s page and pay for it. There is no specific amount for an influencer’s subscription. Every influencer has the freedom to choose the amount they feel their content is worth. The usual criteria Instagram gives to the creators is the range of $0.99 to $99.99 monthly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Instagram &amp;amp; its Creator-Brand Parallel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Fame in 2023 is not limited to just celebrities and sports stars. The influencers on social media platforms such as Instagram are also considered celebs now. Their followers recognise them and follow them to get more content in the areas they are interested in. Many of these influencers often get cast on shows and advertisements or are also invited to award shows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;“The Quickstyle” (Instagram Handle: thequickstyle) earned popularity by choreographing and performing group dances on well-known songs around the world. Yes, I am talking about the group of foreigners who grooved on the 90s song “Chura Ke Dil Mera” and did a good job as well. So, these young creators from Instagram were given the invite to the IIFA Awards 2023 in Abu Dhabi.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/fdc849f7f3c84004b0ee96a4c0ede0fb.png&quot; width=&quot;168&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;As evident in the above example, influencers are no less influential than actors and actresses from movies and TV shows. These influencers also earn a good amount of money from the sponsorships they receive and paid partnerships they advertise. In fact, the advertisements or marketing of products and brands by influencers on social media platforms (especially done on Instagram) performs way better than other methods. Don’t believe me? You must be a Gen X or a boomer, then! But, my dear friend! The data speaks for itself, and so does this graph, as it portrays the brands&#39; preference in choosing Instagram as a marketing platform.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;255&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/b8f0cf6fc100416ab7a0102949c53d9b.png&quot; width=&quot;458&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Many people in the modern world purchase items that are advertised or suggested by influencers on Instagram. One benefit of doing so is the notion that one common citizen gets an inside tip from another citizen about what the product is actually like. Though less popular than movie stars, these influencers give the impression of being a neighbour next door and are thus more relatable to viewers. That’s why the products and services marketised by them have a higher potential of selling among customers.&lt;br&gt;
The influencers try those products and showcase them through reels or posts, along with information about the basic things one needs to know while purchasing an item online. This is a very effective tactic, especially for the FMCG sector, where an item has the chance of looking completely different and turning out to be absolutely different in terms of quality. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;I know, guys; we all have been there! Ordered a pretty floral dress with fluffs and flairs, and what came out was a hybrid version of a nightie. 🥹&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;So, honest reviews from influencers many times save customers from getting looted out of their precious money. But wait up! This does not mean that you go ahead and believe everything and every word an influencer tells you about, especially if the influencer excels in finance or business news. Always research well from your end without blindly investing by listening to what your favourite creator on Instagram says. After all, to bear the burden of losses, no one is going to offer you anything apart from maybe a crying shoulder. So, do your own research, and for that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=interlinking&amp;amp;utm_content=instagram-subscriptions&amp;amp;utm_term=insider.finology.in&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Finology Insider - Latest Updates &amp;amp;amp; News on Finance and Legal in India&quot;&gt;Insider&lt;/a&gt; is present at your service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Ways To Earn Money From Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Before the launch of the subscription plan, Instagram worked as a source for creators to earn a little more money. Based on the number of followers, posts or reels, reach, likes, comments, and many other factors as per the algorithm, creators were able to score sponsorships and make money.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
Here are other ways through which creators earn on Instagram:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Badges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Introduced in 2020, Instagram Badges were one of the first initiatives of the platform to help creators make a living. Whenever a creator goes Live on Instagram, the viewers can purchase to boost their spirits or to express gratitude for providing valuable content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;In the price range of $0.99 (around ₹82), $1.99 (around ₹164), and $4.99 (around ₹411), badges are available to purchase as a show of support for the creator. This badge is shown beside the user’s handle name, which are accessible to creators in a list till 90 days after the live session took place. The list also includes the comments made by those badge purchasers so that the creator could reply or connect with them at leisure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Bonuses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Reels are the main source of entertainment on Instagram for many of us. We are often found scrolling through the reels in our free time and liking, sharing or commenting on them as per our desire. This popularity of reels progressed Instagram to introduce the Bonus program, aka the Reels Play Bonus program, in 2021. Based on the number of views and reach, a creator will receive a certain amount from Instagram on their reels. This amount is not fixed and depends upon the data generated by Instagram’s algorithm. There are 3-4 checkpoints given to the creator via the notification they receive from the platform. Each checkpoint includes the amount they will earn if their reel touches the number of viewers mentioned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Creators can select their particular reels for the Bonus feature upon which they will try to reach the highest checkpoint to earn the maximum amount. But, as of March 9, 2023, Instagram ended this program. The old contracts with Instagram as part of the Bonus program will exist till their expiry date, but no new contracts or invites are being sent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Branded Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Ever noticed the influencer you follow put posts or reels about a certain brand? They do this by tagging that brand and promoting its products or services. This is known as a branded content tool on Instagram, and the creator opting for it gets a certain amount or a business partnership in return.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Gifts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;A very commonly found tool on Instagram is the gifts option. Creators can earn some revenue on their reels from viewers through the gifts tool. Viewers purchase stars which are then calculated on a monthly basis by the platform and then forwarded to the creator in the value of $0.1 for each star.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;These were some of the ways through which influencers/creators were making money using Instagram. With the addition of a Subscription plan, it would be interesting to see whether all these plans would still exist or they would be discontinued like the Bonus program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Instagram Subscriptions: Pros &amp;amp; Cons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;In an official statement posted by Instagram, the brand-new Subscription plan was introduced to the public with a flattering sentence. Here’s how it goes, “At Meta, we strongly believe in enabling creators to make a living through our platforms and have built a suite of tools to allow them to do that- helping them get support from their audience, partner with brands, and earn money from advertising or bonuses directly from Instagram and Facebook. We’re excited to introduce our newest monetization feature: Instagram Subscriptions.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;The subscription program has been welcomed by the creators chosen to do the testing rounds in the US. One of the testers, Bunny Michael, said, “Having subscriptions on Instagram makes building a more intimate relationship with my followers and fans possible. I am so excited to nurture those connections and make a lasting impact that will help keep my work sustainable.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;It is evident from the enthusiasm of the tester creators that the new monetisation plan by Instagram is going to be a success. But what about the other users on the social media platform? What would they be getting? After all, they are the ones from whose wallets the amounts would be paid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;People might argue that the inside peek users get into their favourite influencer’s life would be worth the cost they need to pay. This statement would be especially directed at the fans of the actors/actresses who have or will partake in the big “Subscription” plan of Instagram.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
A great example would be the speed at which The Vampire Diaries&#39; famed actor, Ian Somerhalder, saw a burst of subscribers within hours of adding the option to his profile page. Getting exclusive content, a peek from live sessions, as well as a chat room to talk with favourite stars would give the subscribers an illusion of becoming closer to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Let’s discuss certain aspects of getting into Instagram’s Subscription Feature:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Pros of Instagram’s Subscription Feature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Let’s start with the positive side of this feature. Here is a list of the benefits creators and subscribers would receive by indulging in this option.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;The first advantage is quite evident and is already mentioned in bits and pieces previously in the article. Yes, I am talking about the recurring capital creators would generate from this feature. Between the pricing range of $0.99 to $99.9, an influencer can choose a particular amount for users to subscribe to their account. This would help creators earn a fixed amount every month instead of the uneven payouts they usually receive based on the engagements and views of their content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;This approach would give a chance to small businesses to shine in the limelight. Marketing done on social media platforms, especially Instagram, as discussed above, gets positive results from the targeted audience, and it’s far less costly than other mediums like billboards, TV ads and other “popular sources” of marketing. This way, small businesses can advertise their products to people from all regions and ages and increase their distribution areas effectively.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;As social media users, we are very nosy when it comes to the personal lives of people we admire. So, this new feature would fuel our desire to view even more exclusive footage from their lives. It would also work as a medium of information and content for many.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Cons of Instagram’s Subscription Feature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Now, let’s jump on to the disadvantages of this feature and how it would affect our lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Fruition to the Parasocial Relationships&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Many of us end up fangirling/fanboying the artists we like on the big screen. It can be an attractive actor from a romantic movie, or it can be a terrific action sequence done by an actor. The next step is googling about that character and the person playing the role and following them on social sites. If they are on Instagram, then there is no better place to know about their lives and be in the cosy circle of fandom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;When humans start to create interest, spend time, and generate emotions for a fictional character or a popular personality, then that type of relationship is called a parasocial relationship. And Instagram’s Subscription Feature is a great way for fans to continue that relationship smoothly. With the greed of gaining insights into their loving character’s/personality’s personal life, many fans are willing to pay hefty amounts.&lt;br&gt;
And the creators on Instagram would be banking on this sentiment to get more revenue from the platform.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Revenue Generation for Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;Since the subscription plan is still in its testing phase, the revenue share Instagram earns from these subscriptions is at 0%. But, it won’t be wrong to predict that with good success, the platform would start charging creators a certain share and will thus notice a boost in their revenue charts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;The subscription plan is available for US citizens only (if they meet the eligibility criteria mentioned on Instagram’s official website) as well as invite-only creators from Canada, Australia, and UK. This proves that the plan is in its early stage, and thus it won’t be a surprise to find certain developments and further changes in the policies and terms of use. After all, a huge part of Instagram’s revenue comes from its advertising section. With an annual revenue of $51 billion, more than 80% of revenue comes from ad marketing itself. This amount is bound to increase with the new&amp;nbsp; “Subscription plan.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;378&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/71f6549c84f646f1b6ad931dfb70161c.png&quot; width=&quot;672&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;This strategy has been in the market for a long time, and it has been successful every single damn time. Just take&lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/entrepreneurship/truth-behind-jio?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=interlinking&amp;amp;utm_content=instagram-subscriptions&amp;amp;utm_term=truth-behind-jio&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;JIO on its way up; right up to the top!&quot;&gt; Jio’s 4G free sim&lt;/a&gt; distributing plan in India, for example. Today, on average, every 1 out of 3 citizens in India has a Jio sim making it the third largest network operator in the country.&lt;br&gt;
So, I would like the creators to expect certain fees charged on adding the Subscribe feature to their profile in the near future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;In conclusion, if you have a popular Instagram handle with over 10K followers, then you are eligible to add that quirky subscription button to your account. Soon, this feature would be accessible to Indian creators as well. This approach is a good method for creators to earn money, but it would depend upon the quality of the content and the usefulness of the information one gets by paying a certain price.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:transparent; color:#000000&quot;&gt;The concept of subscribing to entertainment and education is now established within the world. So, the success of this program is guaranteed. Let’s hope that the creators invited for this feature actually deserve the privilege of gaining revenue from hardworking citizens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

                &lt;img src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1020x680/blog/cfbc231823b44b3c9f989aca4c2be26f.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;w60 mt4 br075 m-w100 insiderimg m-br0 m-mt2 t-w70&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;

                &lt;div class=&quot;w60 m-w90 t-w70&quot; id=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;div class=&quot;insidertext&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bas 12th pass kar lo, phir to aish hai&lt;/em&gt;… &lt;em&gt;Bas graduation kar lo, phir to aish hai&lt;/em&gt;! Following these lines has led to a massive group of people in my peer range possessing &quot; essential &quot; degrees (more like popular, but that is a different argument).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you would think that degrees would mean that these peers have the promised &lt;em&gt;aish&lt;/em&gt;, except the &lt;em&gt;aish&lt;/em&gt; is just ashes and lies. These degree holders know a whole lot of nothing except textbook jargon to sound cool. Throw them in the deep waters of the actual industry, and they know a whole lot of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, an argument can be made that they learn from industrial exposure, but the degree is not much help there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while institutional education has reduced itself to not much more than a capitalist ploy meant to sap funds from scared masses, knowledge is still an important pursuit in life. Of course, knowledge can be sought and attained through other means, too, like the various platforms available throughout the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a report by India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), around 26% of the Indian population is under the age of 14 years, making a significant part of the country’s population open to adapting to a new and improved form of education. This new form, of course, is EdTech platforms that are making education far more accessible and tailor-made to the students than just a curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of this potential for growing adaptation, the EdTech industry is projected to grow to a massive $10 billion system by 2025, as per the report by IBEF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject of today’s article is Stock Pathshala, a player in the EdTech industry, looking to capitalise on this growing need for an alternative to traditional education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About Stock Pathshala&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stock Pathshala was founded in 2016 by Aseem Juneja, along with the YouTube channel, A Digital Blogger. Although Stock Pathshala has a dedicated YouTube channel too, A Digital Blogger has a bigger subscriber base due to its longer existence. The Stock Pathshala website, as the name suggests, is a platform that teaches various aspects of the financial markets. The content on the platform is more centred around trading than investing, with a minor focus on ratio and fundamental analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stock Pathshala platform has 70 courses curated by 40 industry experts. The website is more of an advertisement location with no access to the courses/content offered by the platform. To be able to access the courses, users need to download the app. The app opens up the users to the possibility of exploring free and paid content. The pricing for Stock Pathshala will be discussed next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stock Pathshala Pricing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stock Pathshala platform does not have a single pricing plan. The website shows the following four pricing plans:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Free:&lt;/strong&gt; The Free plan gives logged-in users access to “all the free content” on the platform on the website. The free content includes a summary of existing courses and basic information about the various topics and chapters within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a lifetime duration plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Beginner:&lt;/strong&gt; This plan charges ₹999 for a duration of a month. This plan provides users access to video courses, textual courses and podcasts. The plan gives users “unlimited access” which means that they can use the unlocked content as many times as they want during the course of the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Star:&lt;/strong&gt; For ₹6,999, users can access all of the features mentioned above for a period of a year. The “Star” plan has no additional features on top of the “Beginner” plan, except the per month cost is reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the Star plan is more of a money-grab attempt than an additional plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Legend:&lt;/strong&gt; The “Legend” plan costs ₹7,499, but the only legendary thing about the plan is the “Personalised assistance throughout your trading journey”. The ten-year duration of the course seems pretty excessive, in all honesty. I mean, even integrated courses take half of that time, and the outcome is an “Oh-so-valuable” degree!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I hope “personalised assistance” means something other than buy and sell recommendations, or Stock Pathshala may be in for a bitter lesson in compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;On an educational Quest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Stock Pathshala has its perks, the pricing can be a bit unnecessarily high. To top it off, the skill taught on the platform is only usable as far as the lessons on financial topics are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of the chapters focus on trading, which in all honesty, does not really need any skill, as “forecasting” is not really an aspect that can be trained in a person and since the chapters focus on something that cannot quite be learned, how about spending your hard-earned money on something relatively real?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quest by Finology has courses that range from beginner-friendly topics like “&lt;a href=&quot;https://quest.finology.in/courses/financial-statement-analysis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Analysis of Financial Statements&lt;/a&gt;” to advanced topics such as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://quest.finology.in/courses/technical-analysis-of-stocks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Basics of Technical Analysis&lt;/a&gt;”. What’s more, is that these courses also feature various industry experts that add to the financial education that you receive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Treasures of Quest” do not just end there, by the way. The courses on Finology Quest are a part of the Finology One subscription. So, for a monthly price of just ₹999 or an annual fee of ₹5,994, you get the financial education that this entire country needs, along with access to tools like stock screeners, financial planning, journalism, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t believe me? Head on over to  to fact-check my claims!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not just another sales article meant to bash a competitor to our basket of products. The platform in question offers training in a subject that has no innate skill. In the past, we have reviewed other competitors who did not deal with the brunt of the criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/investing/zerodha-varsity-review&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zerodha Varsity&lt;/a&gt;, another competitor to Quest, faired pretty well with flying colours, owing to its offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an end-all, be-all, had Stock Pathshala better, or rather, more valuable content, the platform showed a lot of promise, owing to the notoriety that its founder has on YouTube. As it stands, however, the platform, in my opinion, is just a teched-up “Telegram tips” equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until next time!&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class=&quot;insidertext&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;A spirit that has captivated the taste buds of millions of people and beyond the realm of simple alcohol to become a cultural phenomenon resides in a place where spices dance, colours erupt, and celebrations never end. Yes, of course, I am talking about Apna Desh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get ready for an intriguing voyage as we reveal the alluring corporate empire that is the source of Old Monk, the renowned Indian rum that has woven its way into the fabric of the country as a whole. Get ready for a tasty combination of fascinating facts, astounding statistics, and a fair dose of liquid nostalgia. Lift your glasses (not literally😅😉) &amp;nbsp;because we&#39;re about to go on a thrilling adventure that will leave you wanting more!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Whiskey to Vodka to... Rum? Alcohol consumption in India has witnessed a notable rise in recent years. By 2024, it is predicted that India will consume 6.21 billion litres of alcohol, which, when divided into shots (30 ml), would equal to 207 billion shots. There would be around 26 barrels left over for each individual on Earth. The idea of that many shots surely increases the standard for spectacular parties and unforgettable evenings out, whether you prefer vodka, whisky or tequila. As the nation&#39;s palate expanded beyond whiskey and vodka, rum emerged as a captivating choice for discerning drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/fb58bf30dfcf4b37bbba293975c96556.gif&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let&#39;s take a humorous detour through the realm of drinks:&lt;br&gt;
Vodka, the daring party animal,&lt;br&gt;
Tequila, the wild and adventurous amigo,&lt;br&gt;
Whiskey, the sophisticated gentleman…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, there&#39;s Rum—the free-spirited pirate, evoking visions of tropical islands, buried treasures, and daring adventures on the high seas. It&#39;s this whimsical allure that draws people to rum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mohan Meakin’s Distilleries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few people may be aware that Mohan Meakin Limited is the brains behind this well-liked beverage - Old Monk. This public limited company has its origins in 1855 and has its registered office in the scenic Solan Brewery in Himachal Pradesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extraordinary business has truly withstood the test of time. It was once known by various names, including E. Dyer &amp;amp; Co., Dyer Meakin &amp;amp; Co. Ltd., Dyer Meakin Breweries Ltd., and Mohan Meakin Breweries Ltd.&amp;nbsp;(&lt;em&gt;Dyer naam suna suna laga na? Haa vahi Jallianwala Bagh ka General Dyer!&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;nbsp;Can you believe that his father actually owned the factory, and that is why the name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Company is listed on the CSE in Calcutta. They are experts at creating a wide range of IMFL (Indian-Made Foreign Liquor) products, including premium rums, whiskies, brandies, vodka, and even gin with three delectable ready-to-drink flavours. But there&#39;s more! Additionally, they produce vinegar, canned goods, cornflakes, wheat porridge, and juices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mohan Meakin Limited, a pioneer in the booze business, has built breweries and distilleries all over the nation. Their dedication to providing high-quality items has made them well-known in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production procedure used by Old Monk is a labour of love that combines traditional methods with contemporary ones. The rum is painstakingly made at a number of distilleries around India to obtain the ideal flavour harmony. Over 2 million cases of Old Monk are reportedly sold each year, which suggests that these plants produce an astounding amount of bottles each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s explore their production facilities to see how their delectable masterpieces are made:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Brewery Solan (H.P.):&lt;/strong&gt; Here, carefully and precisely produced beer rules supreme. Additionally, a bottling plant is nearby and ready to bottle their outstanding IMFL selections.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2. Kasauli Distillery:&lt;/strong&gt; This distillery produces the best malt spirits and ensures that every sip captures the enchanting beauty of the foggy hills.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3. Mohan Nagar in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh:&lt;/strong&gt; A creative powerhouse teeming with energy. Not only are there breweries and distilleries nearby, but there are also factories making breakfast foods and fruit products. It&#39;s where scrumptious concepts are brought to life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4. Mohangram Bhankarpur (Punjab):&lt;/strong&gt; The flavours of Mohan Meakin&#39;s IMFL find their ideal home in this bottling facility in the heart of Punjab, where they are ready to mesmerise with every pour.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Unveiling the Blueprint: Mohan Meakin’s Business Model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy used by Mohan Meakin Limited is innovative &amp;amp; adaptable, and encompasses all facets of the beverage sector. They are adept at adjusting to consumer demand, seizing new possibilities, and dominating the market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
Behind its success lies a business model that has stood the test of time; blending tradition, quality, and a touch of nostalgia to captivate consumers across generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. A Heritage of Distinction:&lt;/strong&gt; Old Monk&#39;s business model revolves around its rich heritage and distinctive identity. The brand has mastered the art of storytelling, drawing on its deep-rooted history to create a unique narrative that resonates with consumers. The rum is aged for at least seven years, contributing to its smoothness and flavor. This dedication to quality and craftsmanship has earned Old Monk a reputation as a premium product, setting it apart from its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Nurturing Nostalgia:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the key factors behind Old Monk&#39;s enduring success is its ability to evoke a sense of nostalgia among consumers. The brand&#39;s iconic bottle design, resembling the figure of an old monk, has remained virtually unchanged since its inception. This familiar packaging has become a symbol of tradition and reliability, triggering sentimental connections with the past. By tapping into this nostalgia, Old Monk cultivates a loyal customer base that spans generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Word-of-Mouth Marketing:&lt;/strong&gt; Prepare to be amazed! Would you believe that Mohan Meakin Limited has achieved remarkable success without uttering a single word through advertisements? Yes, you heard it right! This captivating company has defied conventional marketing tactics and relied solely on their outstanding products and word-of-mouth buzz to capture the hearts and livers of consumers. It&#39;s a tale of organic growth that will leave you spellbound. Old Monk&#39;s enthusiasts have become brand ambassadors, sharing their love for the rum through personal recommendations and social media, creating a buzz that money can&#39;t buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Diversification and Adaptation:&lt;/strong&gt; While Old Monk&#39;s iconic dark rum remains its flagship product, the brand has also ventured into diversifying its offerings to cater to evolving consumer preferences. Old Monk has expanded its product range to include variations such as white rum, XXX rum, and flavored options, allowing the brand to tap into different market segments and attract new audiences without diluting its core identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Strong Distribution Network:&lt;/strong&gt; A crucial aspect of Old Monk&#39;s business model is its well-established distribution network. The brand has focused on establishing a widespread presence in both domestic and international markets. By ensuring its availability across various channels, including retail stores, bars, and online platforms, Old Monk has made it convenient for consumers to access its products, further fueling its popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Community Building:&lt;/strong&gt; Old Monk understands the importance of fostering a sense of community around its brand. The company actively engages with its customers through social media platforms, organizing events, and sponsoring cultural festivals. This community-driven approach allows Old Monk to connect with its consumers on a deeper level, creating brand loyalty and a sense of belonging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information provided depicts the total number of shareholders for Mohan Meakin during a five-year period, from 2018 to 2022. The changes in the number of stockholders over this time are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;452&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/d4a562b081af4c6a971ec940724f7029.png&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2018 to 2022, there appears to be a general trend of rising shareholder engagement, with a notable increase in shareholders in 2022. This shows potential growth and investment interest in the company at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Managing Director, who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker, is a key player in assessing Mohan Meakin Limited&#39;s performance. Based on his &amp;nbsp;analysis, the company has determined that there are two reportable segments:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-alcoholic products, which include juices, vinegar, breakfast foods, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alcoholic products, include premium rums, whiskies, brandies, beer, and gin, among other things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chart below depicts the revenue break up for the above two categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;452&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/a50584c052ef4285bd08500828c3b1ee.png&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly and as it should be, a major part of the revenue comes from alcoholic products. And a small portion is contributed by the non-alcoholic products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the details of shareholders who hold more than 5% stake in the company:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Trade Links Pvt. Ltd:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;They make quite the splash, holding a substantial 27.84% stake in the company. They clearly know a good investment when they see one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Mr Hemant Mohan:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;With an impressive 11.96% stake, Mr. Hemant Mohan has secured his place as a notable shareholder. He&#39;s definitely got a taste for success!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ticker.finology.in/company/LICI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Life Insurance Corp Share Price, Financials and Stock Analysis&quot;&gt;Life Insurance Corporation of India&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;You wouldn&#39;t expect a &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/finance/life-insurance-companies-in-india&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/finance/life-insurance-companies-in-india&quot;&gt;life insurance company&lt;/a&gt; to have a stake in an alcoholic beverage manufacturer, but this intriguing twist of fate sees them holding a surprising 8.38% stake in Mohan Meakin Limited. Life meets spirits in an unexpected partnership!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Mr. Vinay Mohan:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;It seems success runs in the Mohan family, as Mr. Vinay Mohan holds a noteworthy 8.22% stake in the company. Cheers to keeping it in the family!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphical representation of the same for better understanding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Tale Behind the Name and the Bottle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered why this beloved rum is called &quot;Old Monk&quot;? Legend has it that the name pays homage to an old monk who resided near the Mohan Meakin distillery, overseeing the production process with a watchful eye. This mysterious figure became the inspiration for the brand&#39;s iconic bottle design, featuring a depiction of the monk himself. Thus, every sip of Old Monk becomes a journey back in time, a tribute to the spirit of resilience and dedication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;From Listing to Delisting: Company’s Stock Exchange Voyage&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ticker.finology.in/company/BSE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;BSE Share Price, Financials and Stock Analysis&quot;&gt;BSE&lt;/a&gt; IndoNext segment, which was designed especially for SMEs listed on Regional Stock Exchanges (RSE), was introduced to Mohan Meakin Limited, which is traded on the Delhi Stock Exchange (DSE). But the company made it clear in a letter to the DSE that it had never really applied to trade its shares on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). The business further claimed that it lacked the support and consent of its shareholders to have its shares listed on the BSE. As a result, Mohan Meakin&#39;s equity shares were no longer traded on the BSE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s incredible to think that a simple rum has evolved into a beloved companion for people from over the world. The journey of Mohan Meakin Limited and its iconic brand, Old Monk, is proof of effectiveness, passion and authenticity. From its humble beginnings to becoming a beloved brand, the journey is a testament to the power of enthusiasm, innovation, and devotion to quality. Kudos to Mohan Meakin Limited for creating not just a rum but a fantastic experience that draws people together.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
Let&#39;s toast to their incredible adventure as the article comes to an end, here&#39;s to Old Monk&#39;s fascinating tale, treasured memories, enduring legacy and their timeless spirit and the remarkable journey of Mohan Meakin Limited. Cheers!&lt;br&gt;
May their story continue to inspire us, embrace our heritage, and craft something truly extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;div class=&quot;w60 m-w90 t-w70&quot; id=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;div class=&quot;insidertext&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;ZestMoney, a digital lending platform that planned to make life affordable for 300+ households in India, is now in a dilemma. From Walmart-backed PhonePe pulling its hand out of the acquisition deal to co-founders resigning, ZestMoney is making headlines constantly. The once-leading company in the EMI-based lending sector, why is ZestMoney on the negative side of the market?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since its landing in the digital lending sector in 2015, ZestMoney has achieved several milestones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It successfully gained the position of being a cardless EMI partner for Amazon, Flipkart, Xiaomi, ICICI Bank, and many other merchants in India.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a mere two years, they achieved the milestone of gaining 1 million monthly transactions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They had 23 institutional investors with popular names like PayU, Ribbit Capital and Goldman Sachs (Yes, the infamous SVB advisor).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Divided into three simple steps, everyone with a pre-set credit score could “Buy Now &amp;amp; Pay Later” up to ₹2 lakh capital with ZestMoney. Thus, as a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/zestmoney-phonepe-deal#&quot; title=&quot;A hardware and software that allows businesses to make sales for customers. In simple words, when a customer rings up an item from a business&#39;s product stall and pays for it, then they are at point-of-sale.&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;point-of-sale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; financing, ZestMoney allows users to purchase items digitally and pay for them in instalments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, today, you don’t hear about ZestMoney because of what it has done in its existence of 7-8 years. You hear in newspapers and finance magazines that ZestMoney failed to find a buyer and was abandoned by all of its founders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When things were going smoothly for ZestMoney, what turn of events made all the founders of the startup resign? Why did the acquisition deal with PhonePe become null and void after six months&#39; worth of due diligence? How is a company with over 500 employees struggling with only a little above 100 employees at present?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reveal the in-depth fiasco that is ZestMoney in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why Did ZestMoney Need a Buyer?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founded by Ashish Anantharaman, Lizzie Chapman, and Priya Sharma in September 2015, ZestMoney, a Bangalore-based fintech company, worked with Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC) to make digital lending easier for users. Being one of the startups from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/zestmoney-phonepe-deal#&quot; title=&quot;An American startup accelerator which helps startup companies become successful in their respective fields.&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;Y Combinator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, ZestMoney became the leading lending platform for more than 1 lakh customers. Amidst hundreds of credit card companies thriving in India, a newbie, ZestMoney, gave people the one thing that others were reluctant to do. It was the option of purchasing things on EMI without a credit card.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right! ZestMoney brought credit cardless transactions for customers and made the complete process effortless. Catering to the B2C &amp;amp; B2B sectors, ZestMoney wished to change its business model into a software service model. This decision to transition was the result of the change in digital lending rules issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Not regulated at first, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/economy/can-rbi-save-the-economy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Can RBI save the Economy?&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;RBI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, under the leadership of Governor &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/economy/shaktikanta-das&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Shaktikanta Das: How did he win the &amp;quot;Governor of the Year&amp;quot; award?&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;Shaktikanta Das&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, brought fresh rules in September 2022 to make sure issues like high interest rates, hidden charges, illegal access to personal data, and more can be avoided.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this means that ZestMoney is not an RBI-approved lending company. But its tie-up with NBFCs and merchants like ICICI Banks, Amazon, Flipkart, etc. gives it a certain level of credibility, making it much safer to use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its foundation in 2015, ZestMoney&#39;s founders have focused on raising funding from its many investors. Till 2022, ZestMoney raised ₹110.9 Crore in 10 different rounds, with the latest round, the Conventional Debt Round, for ₹2.06 Crore in June 2022.

width=&quot;570&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, the revenue for FY21 was ₹89.3 crore, whereas the loss was ₹125.8 crore. Similarly, revenue for FY22 was ₹145 crore, and the loss was ₹398.8 crore. The difficulties in raising funds and the losses the company had to suffer made the founders decide to start looking for buyers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PhonePe-ZestMoney Acquisition Deal: The Point Where Things Went South&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While looking for a fitting buyer, ZestMoney approached various companies like BharatPe and PineLabs. In the end, the leading fintech company, PhonePe, decided to give a helping hand in this ordeal and acquire ZestMoney at a valuation of $200-$300 Million, which is over ₹165.5 Crore. Yes, I know! This offer was way less than the amount ZestMoney was valued at during its last funding round ($400 Million). However, the cash crunch they were facing and the strict regulations imposed by RBI in the digital lending sector made them accept the offer. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things were running smoothly for over 6 months, but then, all of a sudden, PhonePe decided to back off from the acquisition deal. The reasons given for the sudden cancellation of the deal were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not finding a middle ground over ZestMoney’s valuation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZestMoney’s ownership structure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excess pending loans at ZestMoney and its eligibility criteria for giving loans. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the failure to go ahead with the deal, all three co-founders, Ashish, Lizzie, and Priya, have resigned from the frontline. The founders hold an 18.44% stake in the company and would be supporting it as a shareholder. Along with this, more than 150 employees have shifted from ZestMoney to PhonePe, causing a huge backlash to the company in terms of efficiency, viability, and uncertainty.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of this deal, PhonePe is going to secure an NBFC licence arrangement by paying ZestMoney an $8 million price. They had also decided to forego the loan secured by ZestMoney, which helped them sail smoothly amidst the cash crunch crisis at the present time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZestMoney has also found replacements for the vacant positions of senior management. Senior Vice-president Abhishek Sharma, Chief Banking Officer Mandar Satpute, and Finance Vice-President Mohit Chhajer would be shouldering the responsibility to ensure positive outcomes for the company. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investing industry is becoming more and more cautious after the rise in uncertainty in the market. PhonePe’s unwillingness to continue with the deal is a fresh example of this statement. Will ZestMoney’s new management find the solution to the ongoing trouble, or would the plans to&amp;nbsp;transition to software-based service blow away? The answers to these questions are the ones only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Our world is filled with many kinds of creatures. In the vast mass of homo sapiens, people with varying personalities, beliefs, and qualities survive together. These people contribute towards bringing defining change, either positive or negative, in the world. Then comes personalities like the brand new CEO of the popular social networking platform Twitter, Elon Musk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oops! I guess it&#39;s Ex-Brand New CEO now! I mean, who changes CEO every six months?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now these kinds of personalities are pretty unique as they have the power to change world order with their many antiques. Ahh! The perks of being filthy rich! Once the world’s richest man on Earth, &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/elon-musk-success-journey?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=interlinking&amp;amp;utm_content=twitter-elon-musk&amp;amp;utm_term=elon-musk-success-journey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Elon Musk: The Innovative Man&quot;&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; is the founder of Tesla &amp;amp; SpaceX. He has many other achievements under his belt, from being the chief engineer of SpaceX to the position of product architect at Tesla. He also has the responsibility of making Twitter a constant piece of news since October last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From changing Twitter’s Blue Bird logo to DogeCoin Meme to giving Blue Checkmarks to all who subscribe to Twitter Blue, Musk has successfully disrupted the roots of the platform. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: Dear Readers, if there are any new upgrades while this article is published, then I apologize in advance. Can’t really keep up with the madman anymore!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How did Musk end&amp;nbsp;up bagging Twitter?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/entrepreneurship/elon-musk-twitter-deal?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=interlinking&amp;amp;utm_content=twitter-elon-musk&amp;amp;utm_term=elon-musk-twitter-deal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;The Secret Reason Behind Elon Musk&#39;s Twitter Deal&quot;&gt;Elon Musk’s deep connection with Twitter&lt;/a&gt; cannot be limited to his hilarious and often random tweets. The story of Twitter’s acquisition by Elon Musk is not short of a rom-com script. There is Musk’s romance with being the centre of attention all the time and the comedy he makes of the popular social media platform, Twitter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musk began acquiring Twitter in March 2022. But the complete ownership of Twitter under Musk’s wings took eight more months, i.e. by October last year. Although a company acquisition comes with numerous formalities and paperwork, the complicacy of acquiring a business was not the prime reason for this delay.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have divided the whole fiasco into crispy sections to give you short yet refined information about the upgrades that took place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The First Contactabsolutist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Tesla became public, and SpaceX launched its first Falcon 9 rocket. This was also the year when Musk posted his first-ever Twitter post. But the actual story of the Twitter acquisition begins in March 2022. Self-proclaimed “free speech ” Elon Musk started targeting Twitter for not being an ideal media platform. Utilizing his huge following on Twitter, Musk began asking for people’s opinions via polls in March 2022.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A Harmless (Unnecessary) Suggestion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of questions by such a well-known personality did its charm. Many Twitter users and non-users alike (in different social media platforms) started pointing fingers towards Twitter’s authenticity. This is not surprising as the tweets Musk shared in the form of polls had promising engagements and reach. In the midst of polls and random tweets, Elon Musk received a suggestion from a random user to just “Buy It”. This began Musk’s interest in making Twitter his and also the reason why I am writing this article right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;874&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/4a35eef634f44532a26305d5a5650f41.jpg&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Obstacles In the Path to Acquisition&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk was already part of Twitter’s board of directors, the biggest shareholder, to be exact, with a 9% stake by April. He was also invited to join the board of directors by then-CEO Parag Agrawal, which he declined without mentioning the reason. Elon Musk decided to offer $43 Billion to acquire Twitter Inc. and make it private. The board unanimously voted in favour of per share being valued at $54.20 while the share peaked at $51.72 in April 2022. But then Musk caught the scent of the platform gaining spam accounts in abundance. This caused a delay in transferring ownership of the company to Elon Musk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lawsuits &amp;amp; Debates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, it looked like Musk was regretting ever thinking about having Twitter Inc. under his wing. In the name of spam accounts and Twitter’s hesitation in sharing data regarding its issues, Musk shared uncertainty about the offer. This led to Twitter Inc. filing a lawsuit against Musk. In the end, like a beaten child, Musk had to go forward with the planned deal, albeit reluctantly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, we got to see the historic events like the removal of Blue Tick, the omittance of “W” from Twitter, as well as the conversion of a renowned media platform into a meme.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Twitter Issues &amp;amp; Their Solutions By Elon Musk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Twitter had many problems, according to Musk. Apart from the free speech constriction factor, Musk pointed out many problems he came across since the abrupt decision to own the company crossed his mind. I am going to point out all the issues Musk found on Twitter as well as the upgrades he incorporated after his acquisition. So, let’s see whether the changes done by Musk were up to par or not.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Problem No&amp;nbsp;1: Limitation to Content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being an influential social networking platform, at first, Twitter had the limitations of 140 characters. This increased to 280 characters in 2017. The constraint in terms of content makes it difficult for users to freely address their views. Users had to fragment their sentences into more than one tweet, aka Twitter Threads. Although the threads look cool, the problem with them is they have a good probability of getting lost in the crowd. Meaning, the threads are often not read by users in their designated series.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Solution: Twitter Blue Revamp!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remove the barrier of character count for Tweets, Musk allowed the character count extension from 280 characters to 10,000 characters. But, this extension is only limited to Twitter Blue subscribers. The tweets with 10,000 characters are readable by all, but the one who wishes to write such long thoughts would have to pay Twitter to do so. Yet another attempt to monetize Twitter! After all, Musk is a businessman through and through.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insider&#39;s Verdict:&lt;/strong&gt; Elon Musk often expressed his views on how each and every person should have the freedom to express their views without any limitations. He was constantly polling about this particular section since before his plans to acquire Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/e2932443befe465e816c72ca611e9d96.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why make the extension in character count limited to only subscribers? From a business perspective, he is doing fine! But what about the many promises Musk made to turn Twitter into an ideal platform?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Problem No. 2: Presence of Spam Accounts.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What came out as a surprise to Musk during through Twitter acquisition in May 2022 was the number of spam accounts on the platform. As per inside data, 5% of Twitter’s daily users were found to be spam. Musk didn’t like the number, and the company was unwilling to provide in-depth data regarding the situation. This caused a whole new drama for the public which included segments like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Musk’s hesitation on going ahead with the acquisition;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter filing a lawsuit against Elon Musk for going to-and-fro from the deal;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Musk challenged then-CEO Parag Agrawal to a debate regarding proving the 5% mark of spam accounts on Twitter; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, Musk took a U-Turn and agreed to acquire Twitter at the agreed value of $44 Billion if they dropped the lawsuit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Solution: Twitter’s Shadow Ban&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk doesn’t believe in restricting people’s opinions, whether they are praises or criticisms. He, in fact, welcomes them! (His words, not mine!)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;275&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/c24473af69d846d9a7bd6ef6a0aabfb9.png&quot; width=&quot;601&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reduce the spam accounts, Musk’s Twitter decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/twitter-elon-musk#&quot; title=&quot;Blocking users&#39; social media accounts by reducing their posts and comments visibility. Shadow banning is usually done without informing the concerned party about it.&quot;&gt;shadow-ban&lt;/a&gt; usernames that have been inactive for a long time. Notifications were sent to those accounts, undermining the reduced visibility of their accounts due to inactivity. This way, they have claimed to remove 1 million spam accounts on a daily basis. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insider Verdict:&lt;/strong&gt; Although this strategy of shadow-banning accounts worked well in removing several spam accounts, what about the genuine ones? As per Twitter’s policy, if a person doesn’t log in or tweet for six months, then they are counted among the inactive accounts. There are people like me who don’t post anything on Twitter often but still like using the platform. Is gaining information less important than sharing it? Many people also shared that Twitter has shadow-banned certain accounts by claiming them to be spam to reduce the generation of certain kinds of content. So, were you also shadow-bombed by Twitter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Problem No. 3: Constriction of Speech&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the limited content acceptance on Twitter, the social networking platform has also bagged allegations for constricting free speech. Twitter used to be infamous for permanently banning or temporarily suspending many accounts. These actions took place if there were complaints reported by other users in case of abusing Twitter’s policies and violations. Due to this, famous personalities, like the 45th President of America, Donald Trump, were banned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Solution: No More Permanent Bans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as Musk came into power as the new “Chief Twit”, he decided to remove the permanent bans imposed on multiple usernames like Donald Trump, Kangana Ranaut, etc. The only change Post-Musk Twitter had was the renewal of the verification process for gaining a Blue Checkmark. Twitter Blue subscribers are now crowned with the Legacy Blue Checkmark, which previously only selective people got to enjoy. This way, Musk envisioned destroying the barrier between popular personalities and common folk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;415&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/10a061e6e5d749baaaaebaa1b2617a78.png&quot; width=&quot;737&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insider Verdict: &lt;/strong&gt;In order to make sure that a human’s basic right, i.e. the freedom of speech, is not neglected, Musk ended up neglecting the reason behind the banning of these accounts. Many of the entities banned were accused of boosting negative factors like violence, stating offensive comments, and spreading hatred. Take Andrew Tate, for example. Former professional kickboxer and media personality Tate made horrendous comments about the #MeToo movement stating women to bear responsibility for being raped. Despite the right to free speech, I strongly believe people like Tate should be banned everywhere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px&quot;&gt;Among the many personalities&#39; Twitter accounts being reinstated, Alex Jones was the only one not brought back. Wonder what he said, and was it worse than Andrew Tate?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Problem No. 4: Low Profitability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue was the one that Musk came across after acquiring Twitter in October 2022. Twitter was the reputed platform used for historic events such as the Arab Spring Movement in 2010 or USA Presidency Elections in 2017. Despite gaining grand popularity, the platform was not profitable when it comes to revenue generation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;378&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/69b5d6c7ee6a4126a447a39029239b86.png&quot; width=&quot;672&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Solution: Monetizing the Platform&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a step to monetize the platform as much as possible, Musk decided to revamp the Twitter Blue subscription. He increased the Twitter Blue subscription from $4.99 to $8 per month. Subscribers who take Twitter Blue’s subscription would now get to enjoy various perks. Subscribers can edit tweets, get to turn on &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/twitter-elon-musk#&quot; title=&quot;Subscribers get to enjoy using Twitter without any ads or other displays related to irrelevant advertising as part of the reading mode.&quot;&gt;reading mode&lt;/a&gt;, as well as create bookmarks containing tweets and threads they wish to visit at other times. He also awarded the subscribers with Legacy Blue Tick, hence removing the credibility of original accounts and fake ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insider Verdict:&lt;/strong&gt; Monetizing the platform in order to generate more revenue is the main motive for Elon Musk when it comes to Twitter. To do this, he is creating the possibility of more fake account creation on the platform. As gaining Blue Ckeckmark is valued in terms of capital instead of followers, anyone can deceive another. This means if a Blue Checkmark holder at Twitter named “Amitabh Bachchan” DMs you, then don’t fly high on your unicorns because that is not the BigB the world knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being the hub of interaction for people residing in different corners of the world, information, especially news from different sectors, is bound to be dumped on Twitter. Some news pieces are accurate, some contain half-facts and half-baked statements, whereas some pieces are absolute bullshit. These bullshit pieces are fake news, and they have to ability to misdirect an individual based on the scale they are being shared or, in Twitter jargon, “Retweeted”. Because anyone can post about anything on Twitter, it is also known to be a huge circle for fake information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, the changes Musk is bringing in the name of presenting a better platform for everyone seem like unfinished desires to many. Now that a new CEO, Linda Yaccarino, has the reigns, let’s see what “upgrades” Twitter is bound to receive. No matter what, the social networking platform is going to be in the spotlight as long as CTO Elon Musk has the power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;If I quote Taylor Swift, then 🎵 &amp;nbsp;Musk’s Twitter never goes Out Of Style. 🎵&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;div class=&quot;w60 m-w90 t-w70&quot; id=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;div class=&quot;insidertext&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;India’s e-commerce market is expected to reach $350 billion by 2030. E-commerce has revolutionised our shopping, making our lives easier in countless ways. With just a few clicks, we can now order almost anything online and get it delivered directly to our doorstep, saving us time and effort.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has also created new job opportunities, increased competition and lowered prices, providing consumers with more choices and better deals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is an initiative by the Government of India to create a shared digital infrastructure for the e-commerce industry in the country. It is a digital platform that aims to make online commerce more efficient and accessible by providing a standard technology infrastructure for various stakeholders, such as merchants, payment providers, and logistics companies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How does ONDC work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ONDC strives to bring together all aspects of digital commerce and ensure the security and privacy of user data. With ONDC, you won&#39;t need to go on a wild goose chase to find what you need - everything is sorted in one place!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s like having a personal shopping assistant who does all the work for you, so you can sit back and relax. Also, the payment gateways offer a convenient and seamless digital commerce experience to buyers and sellers and secure the confidentiality and privacy of user information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ONDC can create an everyday logistics platform that is accessible to all e-commerce players in India. This will enable them to ship their products more efficiently and at a lower cost, as compared to using their own logistics networks or relying on third-party logistics providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is that there are multiple digital payment systems in India, each with its own rules and regulations. This can make it difficult for smaller players to navigate the system and can lead to a lack of interoperability between different payment systems. With ONDC, a common digital payments system could be created that would be accessible to all e-commerce players, making it easier for them to accept payments and reducing the need for multiple payment integrations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Marketplace Model vs Inventory model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E-commerce companies in India use two different business models - the inventory model and the marketplace model - to operate their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explain things better, imagine that you want to buy a new shirt for yourself. You have two options: you can either go to a store that only sells shirts that they make themselves (like a small boutique), or you can go to a store that sells many different brands of shirts (like a mall store).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first store is like the inventory model because they only sell what they make themselves. They have complete control over the quality of the shirts, but they may not have as many options for you to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second store is like the marketplace model because they sell shirts made by many different brands. They have a wider variety of options for you to choose from, but they may not have as much control over the quality of each shirt since they are made by different brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in the marketplace model, the e-commerce platform acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. A platform is provided for multiple sellers to list their products, and buyers can purchase products from any sellers listed on the forum. The e-commerce platform earns a commission on each transaction and is responsible for the proper management, facilitating transactions, and handling customer support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas in the Inventory model, the e-commerce platform purchases products from suppliers and maintains its inventory of products. Buyers can purchase products directly from the platform, and the platform is responsible for managing the inventory, shipping, and handling customer support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both models have their advantages and disadvantages. The marketplace model allows for a wider variety of products, as multiple sellers can list their offerings on the platform. It also allows for lower overhead costs, as the platform does not need to maintain an inventory. However, the platform has less control over the quality of the products and the shipping times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inventory model allows for greater control over the quality of the products and shipping times. However, it requires a larger investment to purchase and maintain an inventory of products. It also limits the variety of products that can be offered on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E-commerce giants in India use the inventory model to push out smaller players by using their financial strength and infrastructure to maintain large warehouses and inventories. This enables them to offer faster delivery and lower prices, which makes it difficult for smaller players to compete.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the inventory model allows these companies to maintain control over their supply chain and ensure product quality, which helps them gain customer trust and loyalty. As a result, many smaller players are forced out of the market, leading to consolidation in the e-commerce industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;ONDC vs Swiggy and&amp;nbsp;Zomato&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, there have been several cases where restaurant owners have filed complaints and lawsuits against food delivery platforms such as Swiggy and Zomato. These disputes often arise due to disagreements over the commission fees these platforms charge, ranging up to 30% of the order value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restaurant owners argue that these fees are too high and eat into their profit margins, especially for smaller businesses. They also claim that food delivery platforms engage in unfair practices, such as prioritising orders from restaurants that offer higher commission rates or charging fees for services that were not requested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, food delivery platforms argue that their commission fees are necessary to cover the costs of running their services, including marketing, logistics, and technology infrastructure. They also claim that they provide restaurants with increased visibility and access to a larger customer base, which can ultimately lead to increased sales and revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;ONCD vs Popular Food Delivery Apps&quot; height=&quot;294&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/051c7ab1c41f48a8b696f1014c36f2ee.jpg&quot; width=&quot;538&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the conflict between restaurant owners and food delivery platforms reflects the challenges and complexities of the rapidly growing food delivery industry. As the market continues to evolve, it will be important for all stakeholders to work together to find solutions that are fair and sustainable for everyone involved.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ONDC has the potential to address some of the challenges faced by restaurant owners in their dealings with food delivery platforms like Swiggy and Zomato.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key benefits is that it provides a common technology infrastructure that can be used by multiple players in the e-commerce ecosystem, including merchants, payment providers, and logistics companies. This can help reduce the dependency of restaurant owners on a single platform, giving them more options and bargaining power in their negotiations with food delivery platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, ONDC can help reduce the commission fees charged significantly by the food delivery platforms by creating a more competitive market.&amp;nbsp;By lowering the entry barriers for new players, ONDC can increase competition, leading to lower fees and better terms for restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, ONDC can help ensure transparency and fairness in the dealings between restaurants and food delivery platforms. By providing a common platform for all players, ONDC can help standardise pricing, terms, and conditions, making it easier for restaurants to compare offers and choose the best ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, ONDC has the potential to create a more level playing field for restaurant owners and food delivery platforms, promoting a more sustainable and fair business environment for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also Read:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/zomato-success-story?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=insider-interlinking&amp;amp;utm_content=will-ondc-kill-zomato-and-amazon&amp;amp;utm_term=zomato-success-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZOMATO: The Journey from Zero to One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of ONDC&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing ONDC can be a &quot;win-win&quot; situation for everyone. Let&#39;s see how everyone involved in the ecosystem can be benefitted :&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Merchants:&lt;/strong&gt; It can help merchants, including small and medium-sized businesses, by providing them with a common technology infrastructure to sell their products and services online. By reducing the entry barriers and providing more options for online sales channels, ONDC can increase competition and improve pricing and terms for merchants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Payment Providers:&lt;/strong&gt; By creating a common payment infrastructure, and reducing the fragmentation and complexity of the current payment landscape, ONDC can help increase the efficiency, reduce costs, and improve the customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Logistics Companies:&lt;/strong&gt; ONDC can help logistics companies by providing a common logistics infrastructure, reducing the fragmentation and complexity of the current logistics landscape. This can help increase efficiency, reduce costs, and improve the customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Consumers:&lt;/strong&gt; ONDC can help consumers by providing a more diverse range of products and services, improved pricing, and a better customer experience. This can also help promote trust and confidence in online commerce, leading to increased adoption and usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to use the ONDC app?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ONDC is in its early stages and has not yet launched fully. It does not have its own app. Users need to use one of its partner apps to place an order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, ONDC is accessible through the following apps : &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paytm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meesho&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magicpin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Craftsvilla&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mystore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spice Money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ONDC will operate as an open network, unlike single platforms like Amazon or Flipkart. It will act as a gateway connecting buyers and sellers across different e-commerce platforms, enabling them to transact seamlessly, similar to UPI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to register as a seller?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the ONDC is still in the development phase, and the registration process for sellers has not been announced yet. However, the government has indicated that the registration process for sellers on ONDC will be made simple and user-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sellers can follow the instructions to create an account and register themselves on the ONDC platform.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
The registration process is likely to involve basic information about the business, including legal and tax-related information, product details, and other necessary documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why is the Government intervening?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ONDC platform is a game-changer that will benefit countless individuals in multiple ways! It will be beneficial for the government in terms of promoting digitisation and formalisation of the economy, which can lead to increased tax revenues and improved governance. Additionally, the platform can help to reduce fraud and other forms of wrongdoing, which will benefit both businesses as well as consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ONDC platform can limit digital monopolies by providing a standardized framework for digital transactions, reducing dependence on dominant players, and addressing issues related to data privacy and security. &amp;nbsp;Several third-party apps limit the data that they collect to themselves and use it for their own benefit. With transparency being assured, the information provided will benefit small businesses, empowering them to compete more effectively and enabling them to tap into new growth opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can promote competition, reduce the bargaining power of dominant players, and increase trust in the digital commerce ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gone are the days of hopping around different platforms for your digital shopping needs!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With ONDC, you can now surf a single spot to get all that you want without any fuss. You can finally bid adieu to the annoying process of managing multiple accounts and remembering a plethora of passwords. ONDC is here to make online shopping a fun and stress-free experience for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has the potential to revolutionise the digital commerce industry in India by providing a standardised and interoperable platform that benefits all stakeholders involved. By integrating all aspects of digital commerce, ensuring ease of use and security, and promoting a level playing field for all sellers, ONDC could pave the way for a more transparent and efficient e-commerce ecosystem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the platform continues to develop and gain traction, it will be interesting to see how it impacts the existing players in the market and shapes the future of e-commerce in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get ready to join the digital revolution with ONDC!&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class=&quot;insidertext&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Millions of items you could think of, from all possible categories, say domestic, groceries, personal care, and food, collected in an unorganised layout is how a shopaholic’s paradise looks like. It’s also the structure of Costco’s warehouses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reputed to be the 5th largest retailer in the world, Costco Wholesale Corporation is an absolute favourite to-go shopping centre for Americans. Large warehouses with items in bulk have brought Costco the 11th position in the Fortune 500 list of the largest US Corporations in terms of total revenue. Now, Costco, trading name COST, is on its way to completing 40 years. That’s right, a Ruby Jubilee celebration is on the way for the high-on-demand value retailer!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever an American or a Canadian thinks of saving up on domestic purchases, their first choice is to visit a nearby Costco store. And no, you won’t have to travel tens of kilometres away to find a Costco store, as there are more than 400 locations in America alone. Apart from the USA, Costco has made its presence known in 14 countries, including Korea and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While searching for Costco’s and India’s connection, the only thing you will find is Ubuy’s website, with Costco’s products available at ridiculous prices. Despite bagging so many achievements, why is Costco facing difficulty in entering our motherland?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;202&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/709aef9d6c8546a39dc9d267edb2976c.png&quot; width=&quot;419&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;₹4,000 for a cap, really? It&#39;s not even good looking!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me take you on an in-depth evaluation of “the great” Costco’s shortcomings and the many reasons behind its failure to enter Indian lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Costco Business Model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A retailer provides a large variety of products in different categories at comparatively lower prices. This allows them to retain their customers and also helps the companies or brands (whose products they sell) to improve their revenue. Costco, being a value retailer, does this but in an untraditional sort of way. Instead of opening its gates to any and all customers, Costco plays in the member-only category.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might seem biased to many, but that’s Costco’s business model for you. High-volume sales, systematic inventory management (a wonder, in my opinion), and membership-based revenue make up Costco’s business model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Membership-only scheme is the core business of Costco. This has taken them from opening a warehouse in Seattle to 847 warehouses in 14 different countries. Imitating their then-competitor Price Club, Costco started working in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/india-vs-costco#&quot; title=&quot;A retailer with a large store space that offers a variety of products in a single location.&quot;&gt;big-box retail business&lt;/a&gt;. After a few years of establishment, in 1993, both Price Club and Costco merged to become the now-present Costco Wholesale Corporation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offering two types of memberships, Basic &amp;amp; Executive, Costco succeeded in reaching its loyal clientele of around 120 million members today. The Basic membership costs $60 a year, taxes aside, whereas the Executive membership costs $120. Both Basic and Executive membership cards are available in separate versions for individual customers as well as businesses. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Costco Basic Membership Card&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also known as the Gold Star Member card, Costco charges $60 per year for this membership. This card comes with a free household card, which is a kind of supplementary card designed for a family member or relative. Thus, one Gold Star membership can be utilised by two different individuals in a household. The only requirement is that both individuals should have the same residential address.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This membership comes for both individuals and businesses. The price for businesses is also the same, a $60 annual charge, but you would need to submit an identification such as a business license. Through this membership, businesses can purchase and resale for both personal and business uses. Sounds wonderful, right? &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Costco Executive Membership Card&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think the Gold Star membership was full of perks, then you will fall in love with this next one. Costco’s Executive Membership comes with additional benefits like two supplementary household cards and a 2% reward on qualified Costco purchases. Not only this, but the executive members get the option to enjoy Costco savings as well as Costco Travel packages. All of this is available at the price of just $120 per year. Even the Gold Star members can upgrade their accounts to Executive ones and enjoy large savings on qualified purchases such as groceries, furniture, and more. No biases for members!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Costco only manages big warehouse-type stores where you can find everything, literally everything, from a 22-pound Chocolate bar to whole rotisserie chicken boxes. The only thing to keep in mind is everything available on their shelves is present in bulk amounts. In short, Costco is not for people who have a small shopping appetite or people who prefer shopping for groceries every other week. They highly play with the base of loyal customers repurchasing their annual subscriptions and being a one-stop shopping destination for many. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How Does Costco Earn Money?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dedicated to providing cost-effective products to customers, looking at Costco’s business model made me wonder, how exactly do they earn? If you see their annual report for the year 2022 and 1st quarterly report for 2023, you will find a bullish pattern in annual revenue. Jumping from $226.9 billion in 2022 to $234.06 Billion in 2023, Costco earns from a long list of loyal consumers who renew their subscriptions every year without fail.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daily-use items are available on Costco’s shelves at such low prices that people keep on repeatedly buying them. You can get a whole chicken at only $4.99&amp;nbsp;(that’s like a bumper sale to me)!&amp;nbsp;And it seems like they are bringing their friends and relatives with them because Costco’s members are increasing as we speak.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;299&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/7c300220ce5641dda31fe04c0bddec72.png&quot; width=&quot;531&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;One of the most popular investors, Charlie Munger, is the director of Costco Wholesale Corporation along with owning $95 million worth shares of the company. He calls himself an addict of Costco’s shares and is often seen commenting on how everything is wonderful with the member-only retailer.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Business Model Not Fit for India?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being such a huge success in countries like the USA, Canada and even an East Asian country, Japan, Costco is still not available in India, which is a favourite location for foreign businesses. &amp;nbsp;At one time or the other, especially during 2007, one hears the news of Costco’s arrival in India. From talks about purchasing land for warehouses to looking for Indian partnerships, Costco is on and off every year in the market news. But that’s all one can get in the name of Costco in India.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;201&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/4fb15de1c39544f58b206cbae94ed29e.jpg&quot; width=&quot;393&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Costco’s Failure in Entering Indian Lands&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when Costco is the sixth largest retailer in the world with such a promising market share touching 20%, what could possibly be the reason for Costco’s failure in forming roots in India?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few reasons for this unexpected delay in Costco’s India arrival.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;India’s FDI Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest reasons for the absence of Costco from Indian markets is the country’s FDI policy. In India, foreign brands need to give the maximum stake of their businesses to an Indian organisation. This means that a foreign company looking to establish its branch in India cannot hold more than a 49% stake here. Along with this, there are many formalities to take care of, such as filling &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/india-vs-costco#&quot; title=&quot;Receipt of foreign contribution informing place of business within 30 days of establishment.&quot;&gt;Form FC-1 &amp;amp; FC-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to the ROC as well as following environmental and regulatory laws. And let’s not forget the presence of CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) activities as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, India has a politically unstable environment, and the legal ramifications here are way more complex than in other countries. Thus, companies like Costco, with a well-based business model, might face difficulties in entering India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;India is the first country in the world to mandate Corporate Social Responsibility activities legally under the New Companies Act. This means that the companies need to include certain philanthropic or community welfare activities amounting to 2% of net profit.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Membership Dependency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite changing the complete definition of retailing with a membership-based business model, Costco got 200,000 memberships in just one year and became public in 1985. After that, in just three years and six years, the mark of $1 Billion and $3 Billion in sales was crossed, respectively. This proves that the unusual way of doing retail business worked very well for Costco.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From seeing the numbers, one might think that Costco can easily enter Indian lands and set up a promising branch. But, despite a few rumoured attempts, the warehouse chain hasn’t been able to establish a single store in our motherland. Their heavy dependence on memberships is one of the big reasons for this delay. People in India do not like to pay for services prior to their usage. And the memberships at Costco are present on an annual basis only. Although the membership card brings many benefits with it, paying such a large price at once might seem like an unlikely option to many.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Costco will have difficulty getting good revenue in India if it wishes to follow the membership-based business model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bulk Purchasing Business Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The business model that gave Costco recognition around the world is the prime reason why it won’t work in our country. About 1 in 3 people in India spend their livelihood following the paycheck-to-paycheck funda. By the start of the month, we receive our income, and all the expenses are thus planned accordingly. This includes grocery shopping, bill payments, and other leisurely spending. This fact is true for almost everyone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;44% of North-East Indians live from paycheck to paycheck, 9% can save more than 30% of their income. 80% of single Indians save less than 10% of their monthly income. Among married Indians, this is 50%.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We Indians have the mindset to save money in the present. The concept of bulk purchasing groceries and other domestic items is a foreign idea in India, practised hardly by 10% of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain this via a simple example.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose a 5kg bag of flour costs ₹200, whereas a 10kg bag costs ₹350. Most citizens with a 1-4-member middle-class family would buy the 5kg bag. Despite the saving amount of ₹50 with the 10kg flour bag, the 5kg one would be the first choice for most people. The reason behind this choice is pretty simple and wonderfully Bhartiye. One, it represents saving that additional ₹150, which can be utilised for other expenses of the month. Another is the thought process of connecting a 10kg bag of flour as an extra expense when the 5kg bag is sufficient. Told you, we live month-by-month, which works well with the basic wage most middle-class families earn for survival.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
This living style that citizens follow is completely opposite to the in-bulk purchasing business model that Costco follows.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Delivery Dilemma&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you live in one of the metro cities in India, such as Bangalore, then you must be well acquainted with the dilemma that is parking. People are in such a plight that they are reduced to parking their automobiles 4-5 buildings away from their destination, which can be more than 40-50 meters in distance. Even the Costco stores in the USA, such as the one in West Henrico, Virginia, are reviewed to have the worst parking lots. Although the parking slots are spacious, with ease to open and close doors, this has led to much fewer lots for customers to park in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue is the store’s vicinity to other establishments. Indian cities are overcrowded because of their vast population of 1.4 billion and counting. In such a location, finding huge spaces for warehouses a moderate distance away from other busy establishments would be difficult.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only good thing in this scenario is the daily exercise one gets from all the walking, which makes me wonder if that’s Costco’s hidden agenda behind the business model. No??? Okay, then!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one thing’s for sure, nobody would be interested in weightlifting along with the unwanted walking parade. Since Costco promotes bulk marketing, people would have to lift 4-5 heavy shopping bags to and fro the warehouses and the parking location. And using expensive delivery services while shopping online is out of the question if one wishes to save a few pennies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Competition with Existing Retail Chains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as America has Costco, we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/stock-market/business-model-dmart?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internallink&amp;amp;utm_content=business-model-dmart&amp;amp;utm_term=india-vs-costco&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;DMart&#39;s Business Model&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DMart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Costco’s business model was a big inspiration for our country’s popular hypermarket chain, DMart. Radhakishan Damani scooped the business model of Walmart (Sam’s Club), Costco, and IKEA and then created DMart. Today, people shop from DMart stores which specialise in varying product assortment and impeccable shelf spacing. Thus, Costco is likely to face issues from the presence of DMart and other existing retail chains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, the presence of digital options available in the retail market is already engrained in Indian citizens&#39; lifestyles. As per 2021 data, more than 185 million people in India partake in online shopping on an annual basis. Breaking this habit of ease in people’s minds, that too with a new brand, would be a challenging task. I mean, let’s be honest: shopping from the comfort of our cushy couch is way more appealing than finding required items in large warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the blog on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/investing/radhakishan-damani-success-story?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internallink&amp;amp;utm_content=dmart-success-story&amp;amp;utm_term=india-vs-costco&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Radhakishan Damani’s Investing Saga and Success with DMart&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;Radhakishan Damani’s Success Story&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of 100% is impractical. No matter how good a company is, there are bound to be weaknesses causing issues in its pathway to global domination. The same is the case with Costco.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, there is a possibility of Costco’s slightly easier acceptance by Indian citizens, especially the GenZ crowd. After all, we are quite familiar with the concept of annual subscriptions due to OTT platforms. So, here’s a tip from Insider to Costco, you should use the hammer when the iron’s hot.&lt;/p&gt;

Go First had a company crash.🎶🎵&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India has secured its position as the world&#39;s third-largest domestic aviation market, and experts predict that it will surpass the UK to become the third-largest air passenger market by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2036, India is expected to have more than 480 million air travellers, which is higher than the combined number of air travellers in Japan and Germany. The industry has no doubt undergone a remarkable transformation in recent years, with an increase in the number of airlines, airports, and passengers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, every rose has its thorns. Despite soaring aspirations, many airlines have struggled to stay grounded in this industry. Looks like we have another company approaching its final descent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Go First Airlines: A Brief&amp;nbsp;History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go First, formerly known as GoAir, is a low-cost airline based in Mumbai, India, owned by the Indian business conglomerate Wadia Group. The airline was founded in 2005 by Jehangir Wadia and started operations in November of the same year. It operates flights to about 27 Domestic and 8 International Destinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to their website, they started with two leased Airbus A320 planes in 2005 and have since expanded their fleet to include around 59 aircraft. There was a period when many airlines struggled to stay afloat and even collapsed, GoAir made a profit (even though the amount was not very significant), which was a remarkable accomplishment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Evolution of the Business&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, the airline operated a fleet of leased Airbus A320 aircraft and served a handful of domestic destinations in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the years that followed, Go First continued to expand its route network and increase its fleet size. The airline added more Airbus A320s to its fleet and began flying to new destinations across India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They always operated as a low-cost carrier, offering affordable fares and a no-frills approach to air travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2021, the airline rebranded itself as Go First as part of a more significant effort to position itself as a more customer-centric brand. The rebranding included a new visual identity, a revamped website and app, and a new tagline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Go First evolved from a small startup airline to one of India&#39;s leading low-cost carriers, with a growing network of destinations and a commitment to providing affordable and convenient air travel to its customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Go&amp;nbsp;First&amp;nbsp;IPO&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After rebranding its name from GoAir to Go First in 2021, the airline announced raising&amp;nbsp;around ₹3,600 crores for its expansion plans and paying off its debts through an IPO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IPO was expected to be launched in 2021. The DRHP was filed on May 14, 2021, and they even received a green signal from SEBI by August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go First was planning to use the proceeds from the IPO to expand its fleet and network, repay its debts, strengthen its balance sheet, and thus increase its market share in the Indian Aviation Industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;em&gt;IPO ke announcement ke jagah company ko insolvency ka announcement karna pad raha hai&lt;/em&gt;!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Comparison&amp;nbsp;with Key&amp;nbsp;Players&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the Market Share of various players in the Indian Aviation Market:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;249&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/80907b6200e64098a150f0c8423462e2.png&quot; width=&quot;443&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go First, even though known for its affordable fares and no-frills approach to air travel, couldn’t capture a significant portion, whereas IndiGo had the maximum share at about 55.40%.&lt;br&gt;
Both GoAir and IndiGo are two prominent airlines in India that were both founded around the same time in the mid-2000s. While today IndiGo is becoming a major player in the Indian aviation industry, GoAir has struggled to achieve the same level of success.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IndiGo has been able to expand its reach by offering affordable fares, on-time performance, and maintaining a strong balance sheet. In contrast, GoAir has had a tough time keeping up with the competition, with limited growth and frequent changes in leadership.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Reasons&amp;nbsp;for the Downfall&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filing for voluntary insolvency is often the ultimate outcome of a series of unfortunate events for a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possible reasons may include factors such as rising fuel costs, intense competition, economic downturns, changing consumer preferences, and unforeseen events like the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the possible reason for this Financial Turbulence can be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. The operational challenges that they are facing due to the shortfall in supply of engines by Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney, an aerospace company. This has led to the grounding of 28 aircraft. To which P&amp;amp;W has alleged that Go First has a long-standing history of failing to meet its financial obligations to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. The company incurred a significant amount of debt during the pandemic and also reported loss of ₹1278.60 crores in 2020 and inability to raise funds through an IPO may have been contributing factors to its downfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. GoAir had experienced frequent changes in its top-level management since its inception, which might have hindered its ability to achieve stability and sustainable growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Company follows a cash and carry approach, which means that a company needs to have cash in hand to purchase goods or services. And since Go First does not have cash, it might struggle to operate under this model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
They may need to take on additional debt or find other sources of funding to continue operating. Alternatively, it needs to restructure its operations to reduce expenses and improve cash flow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the company&#39;s ability to function will depend on its ability to manage its finances and generate sufficient cash flow to support its operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closure or bankruptcy of one company may have a ripple effect on the entire industry, as it may lead to consolidation and increased competition. It also highlights the importance of proper management and financial planning to navigate these chaotic times. The aviation industry needs to innovate and adapt to the changing times to ensure sustainability and profitability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also affect the confidence of investors, lenders, and other stakeholders in the industry, leading to a decrease in investment and capital inflow, which can make it difficult for other companies to raise funds and grow. In addition, the shutdown of a company can also result in job losses for employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, while the impact of the downfall of one aviation company may not be significant in the long term, it can certainly have short-term repercussions and create a sense of uncertainty in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Around 13 million people are on a path of ending their livelihoods and getting enslaved in the alluring web of AI. No, I am not bluffing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From being firm on the fact that the earth is flat to taking that first exciting step on the moon, human beings have come far in terms of development. Forwarding on this never-ending path to urbanisation, humans came across an entity so advanced in nature that it piqued their curiosity. This entity is called Artificial Intelligence (AI), and it has been making lives easy with every passing day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t have the answer to a particular query? No worries, AI bots have got you covered. Have difficulty managing the traffic? Again, saviour AI is at your service in the form of Autonomous Vehicle Annotation. Artificial Intelligence has been at our beck and call, providing every service we require of it. In this horde of advancement, humans, unconsciously, is on the pavement to become completely dependent upon a non-living, super-intelligent sentient.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You guessed right; we are talking about your new best friend, ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t live under a rock, then you must have heard about ChatGPT, either being cooed on social media or being dished at by your professors. The difference between these two sources is vast, which is discussed further in the article.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let’s see what ChatGPT is and what the reasons are that this particular platform can be the cause of humans falling from being the prime species on earth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is ChatGPT really?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT was called “mind-blowing” by viewers and experts alike for having the capacity to interact as a human. The funda behind the creation of this AI Bot was making a smart tool accessible for all to get tasks done easily with sheer facts and human insights. But, as often is the case, this platform ended up becoming the reason people are now on the verge of losing their creativity, vigour, and even their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t believe me? You will soon end up nodding your head as you go further in this article seeing how ChatGPT is bound to bring ruin to the human race. Before I explain why and how you might already be addicted to ChatGPT, let’s see what exactly this AI is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created by OpenAI, a former non-profit organisation, ChatGPT is a successor of GPT (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer). It has been trained to hold human-like conversations with users, come up with follow-up answers, and give factual solutions. In short, become a confidant and guide to all humanity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, ChatGPT is an advanced language processing tool that works on what OpenAI calls Deep Learning. Deep learning is the research technique used by OpenAI for most of its AI products, where the system utilises a large amount of data to train itself in what it&#39;s designed to do.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
ChatGPT takes data from human feedback. And by feedback, the developers refer to all the data human beings have made available online, from articles on the websites to comments netizens have posted online. Thus, the information availed by ChatGPT has a good chance of being incorrect, absurd, and even racist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While researching for this article, I searched “ChatGPT” in a search engine and landed on OpenAI’s website. There, as described by OpenAI, ChatGPT is a sibling of InstructGPT. InstructGPT is a kind of program that follows instruction and provides answers it seems accurate for it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the first prototype released as ChatGPT was a sort of research tool as it had many errors in terms of facts, human phrasing ability, and even its ability to interact in a firm manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although its successor ChatGPT4 is said to be only a 40% improvement from the ChatGPT November version, that, too, is not fixed. That’s right, in short, the new version is no better than its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT made huge splashes as soon as it got launched on 30th November, 2022. Introduced to the world by other OpenAI products, Dall E2 and Whisper AI, ChatGPT gained over a million users in just one month of its launch. Now, it enjoys active visits of 100 million users by the end of January 2023, making ChatGPT the fastest-growing consumer application in history. Even TikTok and Instagram, the most widely visited entertainment social platforms, took nine months and 2 and 1/2 years to cross this boundary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;470&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/95bf7942eee24ecf8c3ac3e876d83176.png&quot; width=&quot;835&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ChatGPT was free for users to try and avail of its benefits for themselves, many people started using (or should I say misusing) it for their many uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Meet the Creator of ChatGPT: OpenAI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, a nonprofit organisation, OpenAI, was founded in 2015 by well-known names, such as the founder of SpaceX and Twitter’s CEO Elon Musk, LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman, and CEO Sam Altman. Established with the motive of developing artificial intelligence solutions to provide better aid for all, OpenAI gained popularity because of its many revolutionary products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as 2020 came, the company turned into a “capped-profit organisation”, a hybrid between for-profit and non-profit. As explained by CEO Sam Altman, this hybrid development would enable OpenAI to find the required capital to feed all projects, both in the development and discussion stage. In return, the investors would get 100 times their investments as a return, not more than that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-board member Elon Musk raised the query of OpenAI’s transformation from a non-profit to a $30 billion market cap for-profit firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it “Open” AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Not what I intended at all.&lt;/p&gt;
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1626516035863212034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 17, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Elon Musk resigned from the OpenAI board in 2018 and is now found questioning their decisions via his favourite ranting platform, Twitter. Bitter much, Musk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still confused as to how a non-profit to which I donated ~$100M somehow became a $30B market cap for-profit. If this is legal, why doesn’t everyone do it?&lt;/p&gt;
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1636047019893481474?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 15, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another step towards profit took place as OpenAI launched ChatGPT 4, with a monthly subscription fee of $20. This version is available for US citizens at present. It comes with additional features, faster service and more stability. The developers of ChatGPT 4 estimate this successor to have 40% more accuracy in terms of data and facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Dangers of AI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At least with dictators, we know that they are going to die. But with AI, there is no death. You have a mortal dictator from which we can never escape. Virtual superintelligence will happen in my lifetime, 100% sure.” These are the dooming words of Elon Musk, one of the founders of OpenAI, regarding Q&amp;amp;A on ChatGPT &amp;amp; AI. Musk confesses to playing a huge role in accelerating the phenomenon we might face as the supposed dangers with Artificial Intelligence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, human beings have been at the top of the food chain in terms of intelligence, power, and abilities. But, this superiority is at risk of being snatched right before our eyes as AI becomes more competent and self-sufficient as we go. In desperate measures of finding the best solutions, are we really putting an axe on our own feet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see in detail what dangers we might face or are already facing when it comes to AI having a significant role in our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dependency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, let’s assume you bought a new flat on the fourth floor of a building. While going out to work, you start taking the lift every day. There is also the option of health-maintaining stairs, but we need to save time and energy, after all. This way, you would get dependent on the lift and avoid taking stairs at all costs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I mean by this out-of-context example is that as human beings, it’s in our nature to always find the easiest and fastest method to get a task done. There are only a few who will actually choose to walk up and down those four flights of stairs, even one time a day, to maintain good health. This thinking of finding easier solutions for everything is one of the main reasons for such high development of AI in our world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take AI tools as a case in point. Ever since the launching of tools like Grammarly, Plagiarism Checker, and other content-oriented AI tools, people have been dependent on them. After all, apps like Grammarly, Wordtune and ProWritingAid see 30 million, 600 thousand and 200 thousand active users, respectively, on a daily basis. This number is on the rise as the market for content seems to be expanding as we speak. Content is king!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, what happened to the good ol’ method of thinking things out and asking real friends for advice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jeopardy of&amp;nbsp;Creativity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using ChatGPT to complete your emails or to finish that annoyingly long trail of homework assignments, then you are in danger of joining the dumb and dumber department.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeling hurt or even offended? It’s better to feel that way now than be completely dependent on an AI that can lead you to believe false, unsolicited or factually wrong information. This possibility has been accepted by the developers of ChatGPT and Bing, like AI Bots. Another negative aspect is the reduction of exercise your brain is getting every day. By asking your neighbourhood Spiderman ChatGPT to do all the work, you are on the verge of losing all creativity which makes you unique from others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This risk especially befalls our young generation studying in schools or colleges. Asking ChatGPT to write a well-structured essay on “Impacts of Pollution on our Environment” would only require a few minutes of your time, but it sure will reduce your assignment&#39;s credibility. Due to this reason, many universities and educational institutions in India and other countries have banned the usage of AI platforms like ChatGPT.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangalore’s RV University in India was the first one to do so since January 1st, 2023. They also announced the punishment of being caught using the platform with expulsion for the student. I suggest checking whether your institution also exercises such policies or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, risking your future for a platform that is not always reliable is not worth it. AI platforms can be non-sensical, factually incorrect to the point of being absurd and quite a bit hilarious. Check out these instances shared by some users regarding their experiences with Microsoft’s Bing and ChatGPT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bing subreddit has quite a few examples of new Bing chat going out of control.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Open ended chat in search might prove to be a bad idea at this time!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Captured here as a reminder that there was a time when a major search engine showed this in its results. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/LiE2HJCV2z&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/LiE2HJCV2z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Vlad (@vladquant) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vladquant/status/1624996869654056960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 13, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;No More Jobs for Writers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This danger falls a bit closer to my heart. The one community which has started suffering from the profound success of ChatGPT are the content and copywriters. If you have used ChatGPT even one time, you would know that by giving a set of instructions, you can get a long essay within seconds. Plus, ChatGPT also gives its users the freedom to select the tone of the content. Friendly, Witty, Professional, Firm, and many more are selective tones available to choose in its prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is a chance of the generated material being factually incorrect or repetitive, businesses around the world are willing to ignore this in regard to the reduced costs of hiring a writer. There is already huge slumps of layoff going on around the world from big names like Google, Disney, and Meta.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 10% of the workforce has been cut from big corporations&#39; structures to reduce costs, among which AI costs are also included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, all the other writers and aspirant writers, be aware as ChatGPT is soon going to snatch all your jobs, leaving you unemployed and unwanted in this vast world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cruelty Far from Limits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While programming ChatGPT and its many aspects, the developers at OpenAI hired cheap labour from Kenya to remove all sorts of content that might make the program unsuitable for use. Why Kenya, you wonder? Because this has been the practice of big companies to exploit labourers looking for finding bread at any cost in underdeveloped countries. Remember how Zara did the same?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The filtration included data involving racism, sexism, violence, and other such negative parameters. At the meagre price of $2 an hour, Kenyan labourers had to filter negative data, both texts and images, in order to train ChatGPT. In an interview with TIME, a few labourers disclosed the trauma they had to face in an effort to make ChatGPT fit to be launched worldwide.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Alternatives of ChatGPT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter its dangers, the success of ChatGPT raised the competition in the market to such an extent that other big fishes caught the scent of huge profits in the AI sea. Here are a few competitors and challengers that ChatGPT is likely to have a confrontation with within the market:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chat.GPT&amp;nbsp;Competitors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google has been dominating the market wherever it has landed, and it seems to be doing the same in AI chatbots. Google launched BARD, an AI-powered chatbot, research Large Language Model (LLM), on 21st March 2023. At present, BARD is available to the UK and USA only, with plans to expand to other countries as well. BARD specialises in producing solutions along with removing biases and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has Bing, which has been in use on many platforms for a while now. And after Microsoft’s multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, ChatGPT and Bing are kind of siblings. Data from ChatGPT have been used on Bing as described by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;More AI Challengers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk is looking to launch X.AI as a challenger to ChatGPT. The alphabet “X” is an absolute favourite of Musk, what with his and Grimes&#39; child named X Æ A-12 Musk and X Corp now owning Twitter. Musk is looking to use the large data from Twitter to train its X.AI learning language and face its ex-founded company product with complete force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever happened to the dooming statements Musk gave regarding the overdevelopment of AI? I guess it’s fine as long as Musk himself does the development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alibaba has also announced to soon launch of a ChatGPT rival named Tongyi Qianwen. This is in developing states, as informed by Alibaba’s CEO Daniel Zhang and would soon be integrated into the giant company’s various range of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that now there is going to be an abundance of brothers and sisters of ChatGPT looking to attract users&#39; attention. In the chase of profits and large market share, when will the big sharks start to think for people&#39;s welfare?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developers at OpenAI are on a continuous outlook to improving this system so as to create an AGI, i.e. Artificial Generative Intelligence sufficient enough to solve all human problems, small or large. The thought process behind the creation of a sentient being is not the issue, the actual problem lies behind humans&#39; ability to keep that system under control.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, we all have a good idea from those tech-savvy movies of how the world would look if machines and AI systems took control of humans, right?&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when this recipe gets the added touch of a secret ingredient, just like Lay’s biggest competitor in India has, then the result is presented in the form of a ₹4000 Crore empire. Wondering what the secret ingredient is and which company&amp;nbsp;has it?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, get into the bingeing (umm….reading) mode with a crisp packet of potato chips and &lt;em&gt;namkeen&lt;/em&gt; wafers. Because I am going to give you a tour of how a common man succeeded in reducing the presence of the snacks giant&amp;nbsp;Lay’s in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you grabbed one of Balaji Wafer&#39;s products, then you are enjoying the fruits of a rags-to-riches story that has all the elements of an inspirational movie script…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A protagonist filled with the potential to create a bright future, difficult circumstances blocking the path to success, and that taste of victory after toiling away with determination and strong willpower.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presenting &lt;strong&gt;Pranay Chandubhai Virani&lt;/strong&gt;, the founder of Balaji Wafers and the snack king of western India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;559&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/a011379af5944cf782a9eab81967881e.jpg&quot; width=&quot;610&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Chandubhai&#39;s First Bite and its Bittersweet Aftertaste&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of a farmer’s family, Chandubhai Virani had a simple life in the Dhun-Dhoraji village in Jamnagar, Gujarat. The year is 1972, and rainfall is scarce, making lives difficult for the Virani family. As a result of failed farming produce, father Popatbhai Virani gave his sons Chandubhai (then 17), Bhikhubhai, Kanubhai, and Meghjibhai an amount of ₹20,000 to start a new business. Popatbhai collected this amount by selling his land, which failed to give good produce&amp;nbsp;for the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brothers packed their bags and travelled 90 km away to Rajkot in search of an opportunity. Being around the agricultural industry since an early age, they chose the fertiliser sector to initiate their business. This idea turned out to be the first of many in the list of unfortunate failures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus began the fertiliser and farm implement business, through which the brothers hoped to create a fulfilling life for themselves. But, being unaware of the cut-throat world worked against them, as the naive brothers were fooled by their distributors, who gave them duplicate materials. This caused their business to collapse overnight, leading the Virani brothers back to square one. The only change from the time they started the business two years before was that they now had nothing in the name of capital.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have heard how &lt;em&gt;kosish karne valo ki kabhi haar nahi hoti&lt;/em&gt; (Me being the absolute exception). Losing all the money didn’t break their spirits, as they were unwilling to return to their village empty-handed. Believing in the idea of ‘no job being small’ since birth, Chandubhai and Bhikhubhai started working as a gatekeeper &amp;amp; canteen boys at Astron Cinema in Rajkot. With a meagre salary of ₹90 per month, they were making ends meet with difficulty.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerity and hard work always pay off, no matter the status of the people involved. The cinema’s owner, Govind Khunt had &lt;em&gt;parkhi nazar&lt;/em&gt;, as he recognised the promising potential in the Virani brothers. He gave the Astron Cinema’s canteen contract to Chandubhai, marking the beginning of a grand empire valued to be around ₹4000 Crore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Balaji Wafers: Chips for All&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virani’s started selling delicious potato chips in the Astron theatre every day in 1974. The brothers&#39; good behaviour and smart business skills made their chips famous throughout the theatre. Plus, it had the advantage of containing that homemade taste which reminded people of their childhood days. Ahaa.. maa ke hath ka swaad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 1981, Chandubhai and his brothers were making chips in their small one-room apartment. These potato chips were delicious and much healthier, leading to an increase in demand. These factors contributed to the selling of around 50-60 kg of potato chips daily.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The business was going solid. So, Virani’s decided to make things more official by choosing the name “Balaji” for their business. The credit for the name goes to the statue of God Balaji situated in the canteen since the beginning of the Virani’s journey.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing good revenue from the canteen contract, they expanded the potato chips distribution to other shopkeepers by 1984. Here, they met a hurdle in the form of selfish retailers. Many retailers started refusing to pay for the chips sold by giving absurd excuses, claiming the quality of the chips to be bad. Because the distribution of chips was solely dependent upon these retailers, Chandubhai didn’t have any power to change the dynamics. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, dear readers, the infamous stubborn streak of Chandubhai came to the rescue. Taking charge, the Virani brothers took their business to wheels and started delivering the chips on their own using bicycles. This way, the deliveries were made on time, the quality of the products was not compromised, and they were also saving costs for the distribution channel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is often advised to look for a window when the door of opportunity closes. Chandubhai does just that with all the hurdles that pop his way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;262&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/a55f3679dfcb48bcadcf75a3223d29d9.gif&quot; width=&quot;466&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Balaji Wafers: Entering the Next Levels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other brands, Balaji Wafers took its time in expanding its business. For many years, they only produced and sold potato chips. As per their official website, Balaji Wafers Pvt. Ltd. expanded their product line to &lt;em&gt;namkeen&lt;/em&gt; and other snacks in 2002. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 1989, Balaji Wafers were aiming big as they initiated the flight to the next level by installing a semi-automated plant. The plant was located in their then-single distribution location, Rajkot. A loan of ₹50 lakh from banks and others became the key to taking the leap from a normal chip distributor to an expanding business spread throughout Gujarat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this plant, they were able to produce large amounts of potato chips at once with the supervision of an operator. The semi-automated plant helped Balaji Wafers in two ways: one, the quality of the product got much better, with mass production becoming possible in considerably less time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit was the refined handling of hygienic concerns. Everything from raw materials to the packaging of finished goods was now being monitored accurately. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1995, Balaji Wafers became a private limited company as they registered officially. They also expanded from a limited portfolio of potato chips and sandwiches to other &lt;em&gt;namkeen&lt;/em&gt; and snack items by 2002.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this expansion from simply salted potato chips to &lt;em&gt;namkeen&lt;/em&gt; products, Balaji Wafers got into reaching more audiences in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan. For this, they soon promoted from a semi-automated plant in Rajkot (2002) to a fully automated plant in Valsad by 2008, which was the largest of its time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Balaji Wafers: Sultan of Wafers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like a hardworking colony of ants, Balaji Wafers hiked its mountain of success one step at a time. At present, after four decades over, they are one of the top 5 chips and snacks manufacturing brands in India, with a market share of 10.7%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;516&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/361b5481a1c744dc9412e4266fd6e4dd.jpg&quot; width=&quot;468&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you know how Balaji Wafers Pvt. Ltd. covered the distance from an annual turnover of ₹50,000 in 1982 to over ₹2,000 crore rupees in 2022. Dominating with a market share of 90% in Gujarat, Balaji Wafers is everywhere in their origin state. Neighbouring states, &amp;nbsp;Maharashtra &amp;amp; Rajasthan, show a whopping 60-70% standing. Even Goa &amp;amp; Madhya Pradesh provides a good 40% market share for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strong distribution network, exquisite taste, and superb quality helped crown Balaji Wafers Pvt. Ltd. as the “Sultan of Wafers.” (Recognised by The Economic Times). They are also a respectable member of the Snack Food Association (SFA), an international association for the snack industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dominance was proved yet again when one of its biggest competitors, Pepsico Group, wished to purchase the company from Virani&#39;s. But, Chandubhai was adamant about not selling the company whom he thinks of as family. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What&#39;s Next for Balaji Wafers?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being carried from the ground by Chandubhai and his brothers, the reigns of the company’s future now fall on the next generation’s shoulders. Director Keyur Virani and Marketing Director Mihir Virani, sons of Bhiku, with Shyam Virani as Director, make up the new management in Balaji Wafers Pvt. Ltd.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing more on keeping pace with the advancing technology, the new generation’s plan includes increasing the adaptation of automation in the four plants of Balaji wafers. This operation is mainly headed by Keyur Virani, who has a high interest in tech-savvy equipment. A prime example is the installation of the PC 42 plant to deal with the lack of revenue during the lockdown. Director Keyur believes that with automation being a part of the brand, human error will reduce, causing a direct improvement in the quality and quantity of their products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Remember the popular serial, “Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi?” Am I the only one who thinks that the serial, from family members’ names in it to the company’s name, was quite similar to the Virani family? Well, Chandubhai Virani himself believes it, too.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Spreading the Taste of Balaji Pan India&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Simply Salted Potato Chips to Chataka Pataka Snacks, Balaji Wafers has come a long way in just four decades. With over 51+ varieties in the product range, such as Chaat Chaska and Cream Onion, side products like Gippi Noodles make up the large distribution network of 800+ distributors with 93+ SKUs (Stock Keeping Units).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;318&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/7df0abf8e0204955a8cf9c6542adc149.jpg&quot; width=&quot;288&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among many distributors, loyal retailers, and efficient supply chains, the secret ingredient for this successful mix was knowing exactly what the targeted audience wanted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a unified nation, people from various sectors live together. These people have diversified beliefs and tastes, which were expertly aimed at by Balaji Wafers. From launching products for the spice-favouring palate of Maharashtra, to &lt;em&gt;namkeen&lt;/em&gt; product range for Gujarat, Balaji Wafers sure knows what India loves to eat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique is also being followed by competitors like Lay’s and Haldirams, but no one can beat Balaji Wafers in knowing what consumers crave. After all, this strategy has been one of the core factors behind the brand’s tremendous success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the power of this smart tactic, Balaji Wafers Pvt. Ltd. is now getting ready to take charge of the complete nation’s snack cravings. With their announcement to be a PAN India company in the near future, Balaji is planning to start at least three new plants in the next five years. The first of the plants&#39; establishment for national domination has already begun in Uttar Pradesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balaji Wafers also has collaborations with several suppliers to make their distribution line hitch-free. At present, they are producing 500 kilograms of chips per hour. For the Pan-India move, they wish to elevate this capacity to three-to-four metric tons per hour. Some well-known suppliers who collaborate with Balaji Wafers are Ishida, Kanchan Metals, Daifuku, Signode and Sumra.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Balaji Wafers: Rivalry With Lay&#39;s&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid Balaji Wafers’ move to go national, one of the biggest roadblocks for the homemade brand is none other than Lay’s. Pepsico’s subsidiary Frito Lay aka Lay’s has been dominating the chips market for a long time now. But the arrival of regional brands such as Balaji Wafers, Haldirams, etc., has been slowly replacing Lay’s from people’s minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;494&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/8fa65ec7ba734583b578e2ac696a83b7.jpg&quot; width=&quot;448&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From having a 50% market share in 2016 to 22% in 2022, Lay’s, the worldwide popular chips &amp;amp; wafers manufacturing company, sure has seen better days. Despite being tasty and trendy with numerous varieties, Lay’s kept its quantity minimum. Balaji Wafers targeted this shortcoming as they give more quantity in the same price range. Along with this, Balaji Wafers focused on becoming one brand for all tastes, thus manufacturing a variety of flavours, both national and international. Products like Sev Bhujia and Moong Dal impressed people who prefer the more local Indian palates, whereas the Cream &amp;amp; Onion wafers from Balaji attract people who prefer foreign tastes in snacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This caused Lay’s to lose lots of customers from Balaji-dominating states in the western part of India. Balaji Wafers even poked jokes at its competitors about the presence of more &lt;em&gt;hawa&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;inside “ordinary chips” (we all know who they are talking about).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the punchy line of &lt;em&gt;Ho Gye na Hawa ke Shikaar?,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Balaji Wafers markets one big factor that makes them a better choice than the international brand Lay’s. Plus, selecting Ayushman Khurana for the advertisement was a great choice as the actor is known for his comic timing and great screen presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UgYWRRAT2m4&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Balaji Wafers: No Patent for Lay&#39;s&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing issues in terms of quantity is not the only issue Lay’s has to face in India. With the uprising of “Make in India,” all international brands have started to face difficulties maintaining their dominant status.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such incident took place with the giant chips brand in September 2022, when Pepsico sued nine farmers from western Gujarat. The allegation was based on growing and selling the FC5 variety of potatoes, which Pepsico has patented. The speciality of the FC5 variety is its low moisture content, which makes it perfect for preparing potato chips and similar snacks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Pepsico provides the FC5 seed variety to around 12,000 farmers, who then sell the crop at a fixed price. So, when Lay’s found out about the nine farmers growing their IPR-covered potato variety, they charged those farmers, claiming rights over the variety.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a surprise that the charges Lay’s put on these farmers were highly opposed by Indian citizens. One farmer’s rights activist, Kavitha Kuruganti, petitioned the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers&#39; Rights (PPVFR) Authority to revoke Lay’s patent over the FC5 variety. As this move allowed more freedom for Indian farmers to produce and sell crops freely, it was accepted legally, resulting in Lay’s losing a big fight in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident brought a backlash for Lay’s, and the overwhelming presence from local brands like Balaji has now reduced its revenue to a large extent, especially when compared to a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence concludes the story of a hard-working, simple man with dreams to conquer the world. Chandubhai Virani’s Balaji Wafers is sure on the way to extending its wings for the big flight. Though the company is not listed on any stock exchange, the brand is still considered to be a behemoth in the snack market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the core value of customer satisfaction, the outspread of Balaji Wafers in other states of the nation would be a wonderful sight to behold.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class=&quot;insidertext&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Amul is being demonised like the British oppressors it once uprooted from India. #GoBackAmul is trending on the social media platform Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.C. Rao, president of the Bruhath Bangalore Hotels Association, an organisation representing over 5000 restaurants, has decided to boycott Amul products across all its members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a report to Indian Express, he could be quoted saying, “We are not completely against Amul, but only opposing their move to sell milk and curd products in the Karnataka market, which can threaten our local Nandini brand. Amul already has a big market across India. It is the Association’s social responsibility to protect the interests of the dairy farmers, especially women, by using Nandini’s milk and curd products.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if Amul is the “Taste of India,” then why is Karnataka getting lactose intolerant? Who is Nandini? Why the sudden churn in the pot? Read on and find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Amul vs Nandini Row: Meet Nandini Milk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karnataka Co-operative Milk Producer’s Federation, or KMF, is a cooperative society that works for the benefit of dairy producers in Karnataka. According to KMF’s website, it is the second-largest dairy cooperative in India, and the largest in South India in terms of procurement and sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nandini is the umbrella brand name associated with KMF that covers all the dairy products sold through the 16 milk unions spread across the various districts of Karnataka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nandini and KMF recently started making the rounds of various headlines when locals of Karnataka and various politicians alike took to social media to oppose Amul’s footfall in Karnataka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This opposition, in my opinion, is centred more around sentiments associated with history and does not have a lot to do with the facts of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, before everyone who has their sentiments tied with Nandini tries to chase me down with a pitchfork, calm down, and read on. Nandini stands to benefit in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Amul vs Nandini Controversy: Bad Bank Balances&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand the current situation, you need to know the past. The opposition to Amul’s footfall in Karnataka comes as a result of poor history with a government that originated from the state of Gujarat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, in 2017, a number of Public Sector Banks from Karnataka were made to merge in order to improve the operations of these banks. The banks merged included the State Bank of Mysore, Vijaya Bank, Canara Bank, Syndicate Bank and Corporation Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intent behind this merger was to strengthen and consolidate the PSBs as well as reduce the Non Performing Assets (NPAs) of the banks. However, the merger of the State Bank of Mysore with SBI led to a a significant part of the employees to be forced to opt for Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Bank of Mysore was one of the five PSBs that were being merged with SBI, causing around 26,000 employees to retire over a period of two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now whether this move meant to improve the banks’ operations or some big evil plan by the ruling government to hurt the residents of Karnataka is anyone’s guess. Hoewever, former Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah played at the strings of the people hearts with the following tweet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;642&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/680d61385e16477c92521d01bd3fa2fe.jpg&quot; width=&quot;317&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, #SaveNandini became a popular hashtag along with #GoBackAmul and Karnataka locals took to the social media platform to boycott Amul entering the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the obvious question is…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is Amul a threat to Nandini?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very first piece of information presented is that Amul, being the dairy behemoth that it is, could easily burn some reserves to undercut Nandini’s prices and drive its only competitor out of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this threat is legitimate, it is highly unlikely to come to fruition as Amul too is a cooperative organisation, with a majority of its proceeds going to the producers. These primary producers are unlikely to reduce their margins just to gain prominence in a single market. Thus, Amul does not really have much of a wriggle room to create a bargain product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the toned milk at ₹54 per litre by Amul is likely to sell more as a premium product in the state, with Nandini’s toned milk at ₹39 is likely to remain a preference for the masses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit that Nandini could derive from this whole situation is to spread its own distribution channel like Amul is currently in the process of doing. The low price could actually, under ideal circumstances, help Nandini bring something of a disruption in the dairy industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s quite ironic to see how the masses, stirred emotionally, took up arms against Amul; comparing and shunning Verghese Kurien’s brainchild to the very Britishers that the pioneer helped uproot from India’s dairy businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While large corporations suffocating and running smaller competitors out of business is common parlance in the business world, I suppose we can expect better from the very democratic Amul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political sentiments, which have a tendency to murky any and all discussions should be kept aside for once and room should be created for healthy debate. As the situation stands right now, Amul’s entry into Karnataka seems to be receiving a bit of an unnecessarily curdled response.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Jo Dikhta Hai Vo Bikta Hai: The funda most stores around the world utilise to increase their sales. This scheme is especially effective for the apparel market, where customers get tempted by seeing the mannequins donning amazing attires outside the stores. Throw in some lighting and bling with glass walls, and Voila! The lavish clothing store is set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside is that these stores give an expensive vibe, hence only attracting customers who prioritise brand name over price. This is the one thing that separates “Fast Fashion King” Zara from its competitors. Fast response, availability of the latest fashion designs at a lower price, and predicting the upcoming trends gave Zara the superpower to be the global fast fashion expert.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Zara has the scheme of generating products on the latest trends in just 13 days, consumers come across lots of possibilities at reasonable costs. This “buy to wear once” mentality became the main ingredient in Zara’s fast fashion snack.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power of fast fashion made Zara what it is today, a popular fashion retailer in front but a non-sustainable brand behind the screen. In the guise of luxury, quality, and accessibility, Zara portrays the image of being a high-end fashion brand. But, at the end of the day, it’s your same-ol’ trend monger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By implementing carefully observed tactics followed by big names in the fashion world, Zara has maintained its place in the top charts. Positioning their stores in the high street and rapidly reacting to the ongoing trends are some fundamental strategies maneuvered by Zara. These strategies led to Zara gaining the image of being a “copycat” in the global market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From being a newbie in Spain to spreading throughout 96 countries, Zara’s story is crispy and scandalous. Let’s see what makes Zara such a success: Elite style.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Zara’s Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Zorba to Zara, Amancio Ortega Gaona &amp;amp; wife Rosalía Mera’s journey succeeded in converting a high-end look-alike into a fast fashion elite. After starting a clothing factory in Spain named Inditex in 1963, Ortega saw potential in the apparel industry. Thus, Zara came into the picture in 1975 as a clothing store in A Coruña, Galicia, Spain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The founder couple chose Zorba as their store’s name after being inspired by the same-titled Greek movie. But, there was another establishment, a bar, named Zorba on the same street, which led to the name change of the store to “Zara.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the only time Zara decided to not copy someone else…you’ll see&amp;nbsp;what I mean soon! 😏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning its journey with a meager budget of 30 Euros in 1975, Zara was producing similar-looking outfit designs of popular brands at cheap prices. They expanded their horizons in the 1980s by giving their design, production, and distribution processes a few twists, leading to now being a brand with 2003 stores worldwide.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;469&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/272968f119e040c09c5a06d960beee19.jpg&quot; width=&quot;732&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parent company, Inditex, in the meantime, came up with different subsidiaries like Pull &amp;amp; Bear and Massimo Dutti, all belonging to the fashion industry. Despite the arrival of new birds in the nest, Zara maintained its top position in the group by singlehandedly generating 70% revenue. This means that in the 32.6 billion euros sales generated in 2022 by Inditex, approximately 22.8 billion euros was contributed by Zara.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Fact: Zorba the Greek is a comedy-drama film that portrays the message of freedom being an important requirement for a fulfilling life.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Makes Zara Unique?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever heard the term “Fast Fashion”? The process of producing trending designs in mass quantities is what fast fashion is about. From designing &amp;amp; manufacturing to distributing clothing items to stores, the lead time involved in fast fashion is comparatively less than the traditional method. Hence it has been adopted by many brands as part of the newly booming “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/zara-success-story-and-business-model#&quot; title=&quot;A model which contains making new collection designs from the runway shows available for consumers within the course of a few days. Previously, a period of around four months was present between runway shows and stock arriving in the market.&quot;&gt;see-now, buy-now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” model. This strategy accurately feeds our Gen Z’s appetite to get everything within palm’s reach without long waiting durations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, basically, fast fashion is what’s in fashion these days. And a big credit for this trend goes to Zara. Instead of setting a particular design or styling pattern as its statement, Zara eyed the potential high-end clothing pieces present in the market. Zara took inspiration from the on-trend pieces of these high-profile brands and produced their own collection. Whether this can be called inspiration or duplication is a tough nut to crack!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;366&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/5f4ab8e82944444c8dea608a7c5f89d5.png&quot; width=&quot;366&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Zara: The High-Fashion&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Chappal Chor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Zara revolutionised the fashion industry by making high-end clothing items available for all. For this, they have been accused of being a copycat by fashion influencers and other brands like Gucci, Prada, etc.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;370&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/aba46abb8e144129a80ffbcab4117b98.png&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;When Zara copies your homework, it makes it very obvious!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the negative reputation, Zara is now one of the first brands people turn to shop for the latest designs, especially the fair gender. Zara became the place where a girl from a middle-class family could afford the trendy floral dress, usually available for hundreds of dollars in the market. Zara’s success in catching consumers&#39; nerves became evident with the beautifully designed 2000 stores spread worldwide, from Spain to the USA &amp;amp; India, within four decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lavish Stores with Reasonably Priced Items&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zara might be a retailer in the fast fashion industry, but they believe in keeping pace with high-end brands around the world. To do this, Zara always places its stores in the poshest locations in the city. With authentic interiors and classy representations, Zara stores are always highlighted alongside names like Gucci and Louis Vuitton.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the items found inside these stores are not overpriced and are thus successful in alluring consumers even more. Seems like the roadway to “look rich without being rich” goes through the streets of Zara stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Core Values of Zara&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every brand’s vision and values make it unique from its competitors. This statement is especially true for Zara. By following the mantra of keeping “consumers first and rest after” (or so they preach), Zara strictly plans its strategies with the four core values: Beauty, Clarity, Functionality, and Sustainability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These four objectives are a part of Zara’s unique business model, but when it comes to one of these objectives, there&#39;s a serious lack of enforcement! Read on to find out Zara&#39;s sustainability front...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Zara&#39;s Business Model&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zara has been living and breathing the same business model for years now. Many believe that the Zara business model, which has been the same since its inception, is running out of its course. Despite these allegations, Zara is going strong and is unrivalled in the fast fashion category.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zara is famous for stocking the trendiest designs in its stores, and they do this by reducing the lead times between production and distribution. This was the big strategy that founder Ortega came up with while launching Zara. He called it “instant fashions,” which worked out pretty well for both the subsidiary and the parent company, Inditex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see what comprises Zara’s infamous business model in brief:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Research:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the perks that contribute to Zara’s success is being true to its reputation for reacting to new trends instantly. Zara hires employees to keep an eye out for what’s on trend. Every Zara store has a direct channel built where the employees forward the most wanted designs and ideas to the production houses of Zara. Along with this, Zara’s branches have trend-predicting software programs available that are utilised accurately by around 300 designers. These designers work in what Zara calls “The Cube” to predict future trends, find inspiration from chosen trend designs, and finalise the next collection theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Design:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Zara follows a strict customer-centric approach by stocking items specialised for different tastes. Whatever is trending in the USA will be found in Zara’s Los Angeles &amp;amp; San Francisco stores. Likewise, the 21 Indian Zara stores, a joint venture with Tata, would have items similar to the trends ongoing in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zara produces 2-3% more designs than any other brand, gathering up to roughly 12,000 designs per year. They keep low stocks for various designs hence creating artificial scarcity in the market. So, they are giving what the customer wants to wear and are also saving themselves the trouble of witnessing mountains of unsold goods in case of poor sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this strategy is surely creating a mountain of once or twice-worn apparel waste in the world. The renowned activist, Greta Thunberg, commented on Fast Fashion brands like Zara for fooling people by “greenwashing.” The term here was in reference to the effects mass production of these products has on the environment and the brand’s meager efforts to prevent this. Well said, Greta, well said!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Manufacture:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Zara utilises its factories (design houses) for 85% of its utility by designing, manufacturing, packaging, and transporting in-house. These operations might seem complicated, but every step is carried out precisely, without any confounding hitches. Fabrics utilised for the production are transported mainly from Spain, France, &amp;amp; Italy. About 80-90% of production takes place in Europe, out of which 50% is produced in A Coruña, the headquarters of Zara.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might wonder, with such mass production, what are the conditions under which around 10 thousand employees (as per Inditex Employee Statistics 2022) work in Zara?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Retail:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Among the 40,000 products designed annually, only 12,000 reach stores around the world. An interesting fact about Zara stores is that every city has a prototype where they do product assortment by testing the most efficient position in terms of sales. Thus, whatever assortment strategy works for the new collection is then preached to all Zara stores in the country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This super-efficient business model works wonderfully in making Zara the fourth-largest brand in terms of market share. The only party paying the price is our dear Mother Nature. Wondering how? A little patience and some more in-depth information about the business model will take you to the primary section of our topic. So, read on, fellas!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Advantages of Zara&#39;s Business Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zara has always been praised for its fast response to customer demand on what’s trending. Store managers order certain designs, and the New Collection is delivered twice a week without delay. They follow the 13 days deadline strictly so that all levels throughout the production &amp;amp; distribution chain get carried out without a glitch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another pro of Zara stores is their location. You will find a Zara store placed side-by-side with one of the high-end brands. The store’s size, design, and lighting is always exquisite, catching passerby&#39;s eyes instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with a tried &amp;amp; tested product assortment, Zara also keeps complementary items together. This way, Zara provides its customers the chance to create a complete look, thus increasing sales for all product categories.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Zara earns 85% of its inventories, whereas the competitors get only 60-70% for the same. The reason behind such a high difference is the almost no outsourcing strategy of Zara. As Zara restocks much sooner than other retailers, every four to six weeks, they keep the stock amount short. Hence, the demand for the latest inventory increases, allowing Zara to sell its products soon. Limited items are then sold at a higher price due to consumer demand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you are looking for that gorgeous dress you saw a few weeks ago in your nearest Zara store? Then there is a high probability you won’t find it hung there. But don’t fret, as you can get the same design on Zara’s website or another store in your city. With this well-planned strategy, Zara became the king of the fast fashion industry around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Disadvantages of Zara&#39;s Business Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a fast approach to reacting to the customer&#39;s demand and the latest trends, Zara failed to go digital at the same speed. Zara went online in 2010, which was a decade late than its other competitors, such as ASOS. This caused them to suffer losses, as consumers nowadays prefer shopping online with millions of options present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another disadvantage was the one for which Zara has been poked numerous times. Although efficient for the business, Zara’s complete focus on fast fashion is causing damage to the environment. A large carbon footprint and excess use of natural &amp;amp; energy resources make up the “fast” in the fast fashion industry. Hence, the human dream of achieving a sustainable environment is getting out of hand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With rapidly changing fashion trends, people’s wardrobes keep on updating. It’s just a pity that our planet is struggling to keep up with “the change.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Truth Behind Zara’s Sustainability Front!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zara has been going on and on, for decades, about its four core values and how it inseminates those values without fail. But is that the actual truth or just a cover to hide the dirt inside?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zara, just like many successful companies out there, feeds off the innermost desires of human beings. And being stylish as per the ongoing trend is a necessity now. When I say necessity, I mean it in the literal sense.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether we are going to the office or an evening party, our wardrobe now consists of completely different attires for both occasions. This requirement to wear something trendy is now an instinct, as it helps us be part of the “cool crowd.” And Zara, being a quick responder to its consumer’s demands, delivers new collections. Amidst the description of the summer/spring collection, they often (always) forget to mention the pressure their business model is putting on mother nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although sustainability is one of the face values which Zara claims to follow, its business model is largely causing harm to our already beaten environment. As per reports, 20% of greenhouse emissions are done by the apparel and footwear industry. Despite Zara’s Global Water Management Strategy, implemented to avoid discharging hazardous chemicals into the surrounding area, the actual results of environmental safety are not publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since Zara enjoys a market share of 72.96% worldwide in the Inditex group (as per Inditex’s report), its contribution towards making our planet shittier to live in is quite large.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, hey, let’s not forget Zara’s limited-edition collection of “sustainable fashion” produced from captured carbon emissions. Well, thanks to Zara, sustainability is now a limited-edition concept in the fashion world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we appreciate the polyester-created outfits, what about the results this initiation had for saving the environment? Where are the numbers that showcase the reduction in carbon footing percentage accumulated by Zara? Don’t waste your time. Googling it because you will find nada!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Zara Sweatshops:&amp;nbsp;More Like Sweat &amp;amp; Tear Shops!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zara claims to be an environment-friendly brand, as it is “still planning” to start using 100% sustainable fabrics by 2025. But, till then, no fixed promises of reducing carbon footprint by high percentiles!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don’t get us started on the conditions of Zara’s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/success-stories/zara-success-story-and-business-model#&quot; title=&quot;Over-populated production houses used by big companies to find cheap labour for mass production. Sweatshops consist of poor working conditions and dangerous working environments, touching the bounds of illegal operations.&quot;&gt;sweatshops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which are mostly located in Spain. Remember the query we raised earlier regarding the labour (employee) conditions in Zara? We have the answer for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the final production stage, a few tasks are handled by outsourcing contractors in Zara. There have been many cases of labour abuse by contractors where labours were reported to have 16 to 18 hours of long shifts with barely enough minimum wage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil’s labour controversy in 2011 brought forward the pitying conditions of Zara and other similar fashion giant sweatshops. The contractor outsourcing around 90% of Zara’s Brazilian production subcontracted the work to a factory to get the task done. There, immigrants from Peru and Bolivia were found working their fingers to the bones in an unsafe environment for penny-like wages. Fourteen migrants were Bolivians, and one from Peru, among which one was 14 years old, were facing days of forced labour along with restricted mobility to and from work. Many immigrants were also made to work extremely hard in the name of getting legal documents to gain citizenship in Brazil.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The raid caused a huge pushback for Zara, as the Brazilian Government fined them for several misconducts. There have been a few more occurrences leaking the poor condition of Zara employees, especially the outsourcing labours.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite claiming to provide living wages to all suppliers, Zara still faces allegations due to the hidden supply chain. In short, many facets of their supply chain falls under the criteria of uncertainty when it comes to transparency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after inducting around 2,299 stores for the repair &amp;amp; reuse program, Closing The Loop, Zara’s race towards eco-friendly surroundings is miles away.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you look from a business point of view, Zara tops all the charts profoundly. But business is not all about profits. It has a give-and-take relationship with the consumers &amp;amp; environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the largest Inditex revenue, Zara has the responsibility of reducing the doom fast fashion can bring. For that, having eco-friendly stores is not enough. Let’s think big and fast because the trending shirt and pants duo you are eyeing to purchase from Zara is not going to save you from witnessing the planet’s demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;div class=&quot;w60 m-w90 t-w70&quot; id=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;div class=&quot;insidertext&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;In the industry, a fast-food restaurant, usually referred to as a quick-service restaurant, is a particular kind of eatery that offers fast-food fare with little table service. In these kinds of restaurants, the preparation of the food that is served is limited to a quick last-minute step. Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) caters to the needs of both working professionals and young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick service restaurants are the chain models and franchise-based business operating across the world. Most of the restaurants are located where there is constant foot traffic, which is why you can find them next to movie theatres and retail centres.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;QSR Industry Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, the QSR market has been steadily expanding. The rising popularity of eating out in India&#39;s big centres among all socioeconomic classes without waiting for a special occasion has increased demand for QSRs. As part of their leisure activities or shopping excursions, people increasingly prefer to eat outside. The 25 to 40-year-old millennial age bracket is where this tendency is most obvious. Also, as people are exposed to more diverse lives and cultures, they are beginning to establish their own tastes and dining out more frequently to try new foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergence of digital ordering and delivery platforms such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/startups-india/swiggy-ipo-details?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=page-content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=insider-interlinking&amp;amp;utm_content=swiggy-ipo-details&amp;amp;utm_term=quick-service-restaurants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Swiggy is Bringing an IPO: To Bet Or Not To Bet?&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swiggy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/startups-india/zomato-paytm-ticket-deal?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=page-content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=insider-interlinking&amp;amp;utm_content=zomato-paytm-ticket-deal&amp;amp;utm_term=quick-service-restaurants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Zomato Enters The Movie Business: Is BookMyShow in Danger?&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zomato&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Uber Eats&lt;/strong&gt; has substantially bolstered the QSR sector. These platforms have simplified the process for customers to order food from their preferred restaurants with just a few clicks. Numerous QSRs are integrating AI and automation to optimize operations, diminish wait times, and elevate the overall customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indian QSR market is projected to grow from an estimated $&lt;strong&gt;25.46 billion (₹2.1 lakh crore) in 2024 to $38.71 billion (₹3.2 lakh crore) by 2029&lt;/strong&gt;, reflecting an 8.74% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) during the forecast period (2024-2029). Chained outlets accounted for the largest segment by outlet type, with a 52.33% value share in 2023. The pizza segment is anticipated to be the fastest-growing cuisine type, with a projected &lt;strong&gt;CAGR of 11.01% from 2024 to 2029&lt;/strong&gt;. Moreover, the QSR market in India is expected to expand at an 18% CAGR from 2023 to 2028.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Popular QSRs in the world who are dominating the industry:-&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#39;s Rising QSR Revenues: A Detailed Analysis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two financial years, leading QSR chains in India have displayed a strong growth trajectory and market dominance. &lt;strong&gt;Domino’s&lt;/strong&gt;, operated by Jubilant Foodworks, maintained its market leadership, with revenues increasing from ₹4,848 crore in FY 2022 to ₹5,200 crore in FY 2023.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;McDonald’s&lt;/strong&gt;, under Westlife Foodworld, also experienced notable growth, with revenues rising from ₹1,556 crore to ₹1,850 crore during the same period. &lt;strong&gt;KFC&lt;/strong&gt;, managed by Devyani International and Sapphire Foods, witnessed combined revenues grow from ₹1,200 crore to ₹1,400 crore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, &lt;strong&gt;Pizza Hut&lt;/strong&gt;, also under Devyani International and Sapphire Foods, raised its combined revenues from ₹800 crore to ₹950 crore. &lt;strong&gt;Burger King&lt;/strong&gt;, operated by Restaurant Brands Asia, reported a revenue increase from ₹1,000 crore to ₹1,200 crore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These statistics underscore the significant growth and market dominance of these major QSR chains in India. Domino’s is the top earner, followed by McDonald’s and KFC. The consistent growth of these brands signifies a strong demand for quick-service dining options in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Public QSR Players in Decline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McDonald&#39;s dominated the QSR industry until recently, but slowly, lifestyles have changed. Since they are their biggest customers and even encourage the elderly to eat fast food, McDonald&#39;s has long concentrated on winning over the minds of young people. Yet, in recent years, parents have placed a strong emphasis on nutrition and food quality, which has put the fast-food industry at a disadvantage. The rate at which Millennials eat at fast-food restaurants has decreased by 5%, and 51% of Millennials indicated that they are now eating less at McDonald&#39;s. Due to the restaurant&#39;s unhealthy cuisine, the Millennial generation, which is both parents and a large consumer of fast food, has decreased the number of times they visit. And now they are switching to a healthier diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally due to the fact that McDonald&#39;s has been in business for a while, it has developed a regular menu over time that needs to be updated. Therefore, they occasionally need to come up with new or seasonal products to pique the interest of their clientele. If customers are simply given the same old menus that never include anything new, they will likely get bored. The fast-food chains can lose customers as a result of this. Yet, the new addition to the menu ought to be reasonably priced and something that the public finds appealing.&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, new companies like Burger King are attempting to tap the market by introducing new additions to the food selections. They are delivering the flavour that consumers want and the flavour that is ideal for the market. These rivals present McDonald’s with stiff competition in this market when it comes to consumer tastes and preferences. And as the Indian food industry is booming exponentially, restaurants like Burger King are seizing the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#39;s foodservice market is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 11.19% from $41.1 billion in 2022 to $79.65 billion by 2028. In accordance with the model, compared to the dine-in sector, the takeaway and online ordering categories are predicted to grow at significantly higher rates between FY2021 and FY2025, with about 18.0% and 17.4%, respectively. As due to the country&#39;s rapid urbanisation brought on by population growth, economic expansion, and an increase in people&#39;s disposable income, eating out has become increasingly popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the expansion of tier II and tier III cities and the growth of fast-food franchises in impoverished areas have increased the number of quick-service restaurants. Additionally, middle-class spending in tier II and tier III cities has increased by 108% over the past two years, from 2,500 to 5,400. This will be a result of major fast-food corporations expanding their presence in India&#39;s smaller cities and gaining from a younger clientele, including McDonald&#39;s, Burger King, and Domino&#39;s, among others.&lt;br&gt;
The tendency to eat out more will undoubtedly increase the customer base and revenue of the industry&#39;s participants. Having major industry players will increase the visibility of other businesses operating in this field, ultimately leading to an increase in the market share of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ticker.finology.in/sector/restaurants?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=insider-interlinking&amp;amp;utm_content=quick-service-restaurants&amp;amp;utm_term=restaurants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;List of RESTAURANTS Sector Stocks with Industry Classification&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#c0392b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QSR sector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a whole.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Private Players Come for a Bigger Slice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as “Fast food” is no longer just greasy burgers and fries or heavy, cheesy pizzas, today&#39;s youth is undergoing fundamental lifestyle changes, and they are becoming more mindful of what their bodies need ,which may stunt the expansion of large corporations like McDonald&#39;s, Subway, and Domino&#39;s Pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QSR industries will find it tough to grow more until and unless they make a radical shift to how they prepare meals. Future trends in the QSR business will be greatly influenced by this revolutionary development and consumer lifestyle trends. Nonetheless, new competitors have emerged, such as The Burger Company. While they only operate in India for now, they have started capturing the market by positioning themselves differently in terms of giving an Indian touch to American cuisine, which can affect the popularity of existing players like McDonald’s, Burger King and others. It follows that there would be a fierce rivalry when these new competitors enter the market and introduce creative meals that are both healthier and tastier.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, when it comes to the beverages sector, coffee companies like Starbucks will face stiff competition from emerging brands like Rage Coffee. This plant-based coffee business sells coffee at a very affordable price and adds health advantages to it.&lt;br&gt;

The Debate Over Right &amp;amp; Wrong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering that new companies are entering the market and quickly seizing the market, the future of the QSR industry seems to be a little tricky for the industry titans. As for millennials, the price of the product and the value it delivers matters a lot when it comes to health and lifestyle, but revolutionary changes can make the future fantastic for the companies who are eager to bring the change and develop an ecosystem which is nutritious and delicious as well, As “Healthier” is the new “flavour” in this generation.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Like it or not, stock markets often involve a lot of emotions. So, among the 5,000+ listed public stocks, when one pulls a ₹14,000 crore scam, it is bound to suffer the people’s wrath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am talking about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.finology.in/investing/satyam-scam?utm_source=insider&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=interlinking&amp;amp;utm_content=analysis-of-tech-mahindra-and-the-satyam-scam&amp;amp;utm_term=satyam-scam&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Satyam Scam: The Biggest Corporate Fraud in India&#39;s History&quot;&gt;Satyam Computers scam&lt;/a&gt;, of course, and Mahindra’s acquisition of the dying IT company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wrath, of course, translates to the share price falling and the loss of faith in the business. Most investors would shy away from engaging in the shares in the future. They obviously would not buy a company that buys a stake in a fraudulent company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, reasonably speaking, based on Satyam’s not-so-positive image, an investor would not engage with Mahindra’s stock. However, Mukul had a different idea. He invested in Mahindra when it was in the process of acquiring Satyam computers after its short-circuit in the year 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why did Mukul invest in a company that was associated with a fraudulent entity? Because he saw potential. And the fraud was not necessarily a red flag but a discount offer for him. Sure as hell, the potential he saw came through, and his investment from the year 2010 gave returns worth 5-6 times in 9 years. That’s a CAGR of 21% from a single stock!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am not here to sell you on Mahindra or any stock for that matter. I am here to propagate Mukul’s investment style. Yes, I know your question, “Who is Mukul, and why should I read about how he invests?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Mukul is better known as Asset Yogi (I bet that rings some bells)! Mukul pulled a “Maggie” on himself, and his YouTube username has gained such traction that it has overshadowed his real name!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, with the introductions out of the way, let us learn how to find turnaround stocks, “The Asset Yogi Way”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Satyam Scam Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reach the point of Mukul’s purchase of Mahindra shares, we need to understand the circumstances that led to Satyam’s acquisition by Mahindra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scam was exposed in the year 2009 by none other than Satyam Computers’ CEO, Raju Ramalingam. The exposure led to a massive fallout which caused the share prices to drop by 73% and reach near penny stock levels of ₹24.5 on January 16, 2009. This crash led to the aforementioned ₹14,000 crore erosion of investor wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the government had to intervene and involve other companies to take over Satyam’s operations. Among the companies involved in this takeover were Mahindra (obviously) as well as L&amp;amp;T. L&amp;amp;T’s involvement in the takeover process is what exposed Mukul to the inner workings of the takeover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another source of information for Mukul turned out to be his newlywed wife, who was employed at Satyam at the time. With all of these bits of information, Mukul interest in the Satyam Debacle (as he calls it) only grew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the aspects of the company that he looked into to better understand how things would unfold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Qualitative Aspects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the scam and the takeover, whether or not Satyam was a lucrative or investable business was out of the question. That ship had sailed, hit its iceberg and was on its way to the bottom of the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the effect of Satyam’s scam would have far-reaching effects on the acquiring company’s balance sheet and reputation. Here is how Mukul figured Satyam Computers would affect Mahindra:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Size of the Fraud:&lt;/strong&gt; Although the fraud had been labelled to be worth ₹14,000 crores, this number covered just the erosion of investor wealth. The acquisition of Satyam would be a costly task for Mahindra in terms of repayments of liabilities, managing new employees and other assets, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mahindra would have had a better idea about this aspect, as it would have performed its due diligence before taking on this sinking company. However, as far as an investor in Mahindra was concerned, Mukul needed to understand the fraud’s effect on his portfolio if he invested in Mahindra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Unidentified Liabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; Raju Ramalinga had cooked his books of accounts to appear more profitable. Through this inflated image, he was able to acquire cheap loans from the USA. The funds from these loans were never shown in the accounts of Satyam Computers and were used by Raju to experiment with real estate in Hyderabad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of disclosure of these loans made it difficult to gauge the true liability that Mahindra would incur on buying a majority stake in Satyam. The loans also came coupled with pending liabilities that Mahindra could have to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Customer Loss:&lt;/strong&gt; Although the scam was more centred towards the books of accounts and stock manipulation, Satyam&#39;s customer faced side had to deal with the repercussions of the scam’s publicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mahindra acquiring Satyam would bring the same loss of face to Mahindra’s doorsteps too. Mahindra would have to go ballistic on its publicity and operations together to mitigate this threat to its image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Management:&lt;/strong&gt; Investors in Mahindra would also have to worry about the management already in place as well as the staff being onboarded to handle the new business arm. The management would need to have enough experience as well as a positive track record to be able to handle the risks mentioned above that Satyam would bring to the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I want readers to notice how the first aspect that Mukul focused on was the qualitative factors. Most investors (including myself) often dive head-first into the valuation and the numerical aspects of a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is a necessary aspect to look into, it is better to look into the operations of the business to understand whether spending any amount of time understanding the numbers would lead to a worthwhile investment decision. Too often, the retail crowd develops a bias due to the time sunken into research to stay objective to the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of valuation, here is how Mukul went about understanding the worth of the amalgam being formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Valuation of Mahindra Satyam&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mahindra acquired a 51% stake in Satyam Computers at ₹2,800 crore. This meant that even when Satyam was deep in the midst of chaos, Mahindra valued the business at ₹5,600 crore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, whether or not this valuation was accurate depended on the company’s profits. However, Raju had inflated those numbers in order to raise Satyam Computers’ share prices. This allowed the shareholders to sell at a price that was higher than what the company was actually worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inflated earnings also allowed Raju to acquire cheap loans that he squandered on real estate, as mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, since the company’s earnings were skewered, another metric that could come in handy would be the sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Mukul took September 2008’s quarterly sales results into consideration which stood at ₹2,100 crore. This figure was then annualised to reach ₹8,400 crore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the industry standard of profit to sales (or P/S) ratio is 4x. Which meant that a company’s market capitalisation would be 4 times its annual sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying this standard P/S to Satyam’s figures, its market capitalisation would stand at ₹33,600 crore (₹8,400 crore x 4). However, this was a rather optimistic approach to value the shares of a company that had attracted a negative light recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the “Customer Loss” mentioned above? Since Mukul was using sales as a metric for valuation, he considered Satyam’s infamy losing Mahindra 80% of its customers. So, he reduced the sales figure by 80%, reaching an annual sales figure of ₹1,680 crore. Applying the industry P/E to this figure led to a market capitalisation of ₹6,720 crore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Mahindra was acquiring a business worth ₹6,720 crore (worst case scenario) for ₹5,600 crore. So as far as valuation was concerned, Mahindra got a bargain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, Mukul did not invest. While the valuation was attractive, there were still a lot of moving parts to think about. So he waited a year to get the Mahindra Satyam’s (the name post-acquisition) annual reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mahindra Satyam’s Financials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waiting a year led to Mahindra Satyam producing the following figures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table border=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Particulars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FY 2008-09 (figures in ₹ cr)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FY 2009-10 (figures in ₹ cr)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8,473.5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5,481.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EBITDA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1,834.9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;554.8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EBITDA Margin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21.7%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10.1%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profit After Tax (PAT)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1,687.9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-124.6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAT Margin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19.9%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-2.3%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net Worth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7,239.2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1,880.9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the annualised sales were actually underballing the actual sales for the year 2008-09, and the approximation was actually safe. However, the year 2009-10 saw the financials dip into the negatives as sales fell and the net profit turned into a loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these dips were understandable, though. The drop in sales was obvious due to client loss, as mentioned above, but the drop was not as drastic. The loss was due to an extraordinary item of ₹400 crore which could have been settlements and other obligatory payments. According to Mukul, this loss was not worth too much worry as it was not too large and was caused due to a one-time obligatory payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the net worth was concerned, it was another one of the figures inflated due to cooked books. This meant that a lot of assets in Satyam Computers’ books were actually non-existent. The figure did not hit rock bottom, however, as Mahindra had infused some capital into the newly merged business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these figures, Mukul was able to build conviction around the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Benefits for Mahindra Satyam in buying Satyam Computers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the numbers, Mukul was confident in Mahindra’s ability to turn Satyam Computers’ around because of the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Brand Trust:&lt;/strong&gt; Although Mahindra Satyam was a new player in the IT sector, Mahindra Group had already made its bones as a conglomerate. It was seen as a titan equal to Tata and Godrej. This renown would definitely help it counter the fall from grace brought by Satyam Computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Synergies:&lt;/strong&gt; Tech Mahindra was formed as a JV between British Telecom and the Mahindra Group. While this meant that the group ventured into the IT sector, its specialisation was limited to the telecom industry. Diversification would need employing resources from scratch with additional costs in client acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acquiring Satyam Computers afforded Mahindra Satyam a head start in the learning curve. The fact that the acquisition worked out at a discount only added the cherry on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Existing Investments:&lt;/strong&gt; While the owner of Satyam Computers was engaged in fraud, it was more about the manipulation of funds, not necessarily a non-existent business. The funds manipulated had to come from somewhere, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satyam’s base business had made some investments to scale the business, even if to further draw more funds to misdirect. These investments included development centres, increased hiring of employees, customer relations, etc. This meant that Mahindra was buying a business that could be scaled and was ready for the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Profitability:&lt;/strong&gt; Although the latest financial statements had presented a net loss in the books, it was a negligible amount compared to the size of the business and had occurred due to an out-of-the-ordinary expense. Thus, the business’s&amp;nbsp;earnings could potentially increase if Mahindra bucked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Valuation:&lt;/strong&gt; A lot can change in a year, especially in the stock market. So, Mahindra Satyam’s valuation had gone up from ₹5,600 crore to ₹11,000 crore. While this meant that the prices had almost doubled, based on sales figures of 2010, the P/S still stood at 2x, which was still half of the industrial standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mahindra Satyam: The Turnaround Stock Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armed with the aforementioned information, Mukul ended up investing in Mahindra Satyam, and the rest was history. Still, for a little reminder, these are the turnaround results he experienced with Mahindra Satyam:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. The company turned profitable by the year 2011-12 and decreased its operational costs.&lt;br&gt;
2. Mahindra Satyam’s net worth increased by 70% from the previous year.&lt;br&gt;
3. The company managed to retain 50% of its client base as opposed to the 20% that Mukul had anticipated. On top of this, the new entity managed to acquire 44 new clients.&lt;br&gt;
4. There were also talks of Tech Mahindra and Mahindra Satyam being merged. Here are the details of the newly merged entity, Tech Mahindra:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FY 2013-14 (figures in ₹ cr)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

Based on these new and definitely improved numbers, Mukul knew that Tech Mahindra would take off, and sure enough, it did. Pre-merger, the stock prices were around ₹200 which skyrocketed up to ₹800 plus when Mukul exited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for those wondering, “If the stock was doing so well, why did Mukul exit?” Well, Mukul exited pre-covid lockdowns in India. The reason behind his exit was the possible fluctuation that the upcoming would pandemic would bring on the stock markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article may have Mukul’s research at heart, but it is not so much an ode to his ability with the stock market but his near-replicable approach to it. Most other media platforms would lose the plot here and try to sell the greatness of the investor, driving away from the learnings that they would wish to impart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is no question about Mukul’s skill, it is his level-headed and focused approach that helped him take benefit of a scam. Where retail investors often get lost in the herd mentality approach of finding a heavily discounted stock that would boom, they forget to apply the very simple rule of engaging businesses they understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mukul was already engaged in the IT domain, and the Satyam Scam only drew his attention to it. He did not go out of his way to invest in a business that he had little to no understanding of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another point to note is that people often tend to focus purely on the numbers and forget the qualitative aspects of a business. Investors arrive at valuation results without necessarily knowing the business internally and conducting a superficial comparison with peers that operate in the same industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this presents no concrete style or rule of thumb for picking a particular stock or an industry, but I suppose that is the entire point. There is no “one size fits all” rule except the one that says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Research is king!”&lt;br&gt;

                    &lt;div class=&quot;insidertext&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;When I say (write) “football”, which country, player or league comes to your mind? India is probably not your first guess, I guess. Why can’t the country that rules the cricket world; be an average football team, let alone the best? And let me remind you, England created cricket and football, so that’s not the case if you’re thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I have some pretty good questions, and yes, I have certain solutions, and yes, there is money involved! Geez, greedy much?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s talk money. The FIFA world cup winning prize money is $40 million while the 2022 cricket T20 world cup prize is only $1.2 million. I mean, is popularity everything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of popularity, please follow Insider by Finology on Instagram 📸!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic finance rule of demand and supply is what’s at play. People around the world want to see football, and broadcasting makes all the difference. The total viewership of the 2018 FIFA world cup was 3.572 billion people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all fans of IPL and are aware of every team and player. But do we know our starting 11 in the Indian national football team? India is not even in the top one …….hundred! Yup, apparently, &lt;em&gt;sabse aage honge Hindustani&lt;/em&gt; is gonna take a while in football.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we know very well IPL is a month-long, annual, money-making fever in India, but with football, it’s a money-making coma. 😵 It&#39;s all business, and we know it. Mukesh Ambani, a master businessman, does not own an ISL (Indian Super League) team, but is interested in buying Liverpool FC, an English premier league football club. So much for “buy local”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px&quot;&gt;Basketball superstar LeBron James bought 2% of Liverpool FC in 2011 for $6.5 million and earned around $44 million as of now.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The European Football Economy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey India, take notes!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indian Football team lags because of the sheer lack of scope. Not only for the players but also in terms of sources to earn from through the sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call it negligence, but the state of Football in India is truly monetarily &lt;em&gt;kupo-shit&lt;/em&gt;. In the case of European Football, the revenue-driving strategies just somehow keep working out like God came to the fields and blessed the sport for them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Broadcasting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maximum amount of money is made by broadcasting rights, and the 5 major leagues are the most popular Barclays Premier League (ENGLAND), La Liga (SPAIN), Bundesliga (GERMANY), Serie A (ITALY), League 1 (FRANCE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barclays Premier League is the most popular league in the world, and they earn billions of dollars in broadcasting. They earn more than 4000 &lt;em&gt;Sharma Ji ke bete&lt;/em&gt; (yes, we did the math)!&amp;nbsp;For the 2021-22 year, Barclays Premier League earned €3.5 billion through broadcast rights alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put this number in perspective, Barclays’ broadcasting revenue was greater than the next two earners combined. La Liga and Bundesliga together earned €2.05 billion and €1.46 billion, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;531&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/6ec631bbd68a4128b6badb67d941fbb2.png&quot; width=&quot;944&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Match-day&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the pre covid years of 2018-19 (when stadiums were not live Petri dishes of viral infections), Manchester United, an EPL team, earned approximately £3.96 million per game. Yes! On the match day, the home team earns via tickets, food and drinks.&lt;br&gt;
I wonder why Indians are not allowed to drink in a cricket match… Wait! I just realised what I just said. If Indian fans can do what they did in 1996 at Eden Gardens. Best keep them sober!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But believe it or not, it’s a big part of their income and how they pay their players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, they sell their jerseys as merchandise. I know you must be thinking, “Big deal, how much can a team earn from jerseys?” Well, the English club Manchester United made 60 million dollars in jersey sales in 12 hours with the transfer of Cristiano Ronaldo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/3d89927ebf354a679b1a7310af856f61.gif&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Manchester United after transferring Ronaldo: Suiiiii&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Player market&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europeans and “people trade” doesn’t exactly sound like a fun ordeal, but football clubs and player exchanges are not as bleak as you would think. We are used to watching cricketers playing IPL once a year and playing International matches more often. In European football, however, the players hardly play for their country 6 to 7 times a year, with each cup holding 2-3 matches per team. And that’s how much I contribute to my workplace. They call it the international break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top 3 club matches, on the other hand, pit each team against another in 30+ matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teams contact the players or get them transferred from one team to another. Neymar Jr was sold from Barcelona (a Spanish club) to Paris Saint Germain (a French club) for £222 million.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px&quot;&gt;The world’s richest football player is neither Messi nor Ronaldo. It&#39;s Faiq Bolkiah. He comes from the Royal family of Brunei and has a net worth of $20 billion!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What can we do to change the Indian state of football?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s going to take a while, but it can work. We must support Indian football, not just the national team but the Indian Super League. We need to realise the importance of football in India and how, in the next Fifa world cup, as I am writing this piece, the Indian national football team&#39;s rank in the world is 106. It&#39;s so sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, for one, am living proof that India is a football-loving country. Not just us but higher sports authorities in the country should also make efforts to increase funds. The funds for cricket in India are way more than the International Cricket Council. Indians need to realise that football can significantly increase our nation&#39;s economy. Till then, we can support other countries in the FIFA world cup. I’m supporting Argentina.&lt;br&gt;
(&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: This article was written before the 2022 FIFA finals. The writer is indeed an Argentina fan and not just a poser.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s odd if you think about active cricket players like M.S. Dhoni and Virat Kohli are Indian football club owners, and football players are not even recognised in our country. Hell, IPL teams even have their own valuation as companies! Remember when CSK became a unicorn? Imagine if these teams had IPOs and you could get a little piece of the FIFA action!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paisa hi paisa hoga!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class=&quot;insidertext&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mentos…Dimaag ki batti jala de!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you might just argue that it didn’t quite light up the brilliant minds of the UPI makers as they began on a journey to crush the toffee industry. Confused? Here’s an explainer:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know the hassle of not having ₹2 or ₹5 change in our pockets when we go to a local kirana store or the paanwala around the corner of our street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember which chocolate you got in return as &lt;em&gt;chhutta&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;from the shopkeeper? Maybe an Eclairs? Or an Alpenliebe? Or a Mango Bite? Well, the list goes on!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, no one likes to be handed toffees every time. Additionally, it seems that inflation has pumped up the &lt;em&gt;chhutta&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;game. Now, shopkeepers sometimes don’t have change for an amount of ₹10! Now, you wouldn’t want to trade a Dairy Milk bar every time you made a small purchase, right? Thanks to UPI, now you only pay for what you want.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Running behind in the race?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The confectionery industry as a whole grew at a CAGR of &lt;strong&gt;6.6%&lt;/strong&gt; between &lt;strong&gt;2017&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;2021&lt;/strong&gt;. A further breakdown of the confectionery industry into the chocolate confectionery, sugar confectionery and gum segments suggests that the sector witnessed subdued trends during the period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the chocolate and sugar segments registered a marginal CAGR of &lt;strong&gt;7.1%&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;6.8%&lt;/strong&gt;, the gum segment saw an even lower CAGR of &lt;strong&gt;2.8%&lt;/strong&gt; in terms of volume between &lt;strong&gt;2017-2021&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s top five sugar confectionery companies accounted for a &lt;strong&gt;51.6%&lt;/strong&gt; market share in &lt;strong&gt;2021,&lt;/strong&gt; with Parle Products Pvt Ltd at the top with a 15.9% share, followed by ITC Group at 15.2%, Mondelez International Inc at 7.9%, Perfetti Van Melle Group at 7.6%&amp;nbsp;and DS Group at 5%.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;493&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/97a04b5b52ee4414b634ce3298d15364.png&quot; width=&quot;877&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toffees, caramels and nougat&lt;/strong&gt; ruled the market with the highest retail sales, the segment experienced a CAGR of &lt;strong&gt;6.7%&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Boiled sweets&lt;/strong&gt; followed with a &lt;strong&gt;5%&lt;/strong&gt; CAGR in sales. &lt;strong&gt;Pastilles, gums and jellies&lt;/strong&gt; recorded the lowest overall sales, but the sector grew at a rate of &lt;strong&gt;11.4%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What seems to be the hurdle?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have savoured these toffees for as long as we can remember. But times change. In the latest debate, some people are saying that the invention of the mighty UPI has crushed the toffee industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ummm, surprising? Here’s an &lt;strong&gt;Insider&lt;/strong&gt;: With the advent of digital payments, people now pay the exact amount of purchases through online payment, which leaves no scope of selling toffees in the garb of &lt;em&gt;chhutta&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, UPI is practically everywhere, from your cabs to your LPG booking, and it can definitely reduce the margins of shopkeepers as the ₹2 and ₹5 changes amount to a huge figure at the end of the day. With no more balance in transactions, there will be no concept of &lt;em&gt;chhutta&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;left!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Rise of UPI and Fall of Toffee?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPI, launched in 2016, is a system that bundles multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application. It merges several banking features, seamless fund routing &amp;amp; merchant payments under one hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPI gave impetus to the &lt;strong&gt;Digital India&lt;/strong&gt; initiative by aiming to reduce cash-based transactions. According to data by &lt;strong&gt;NPCI&lt;/strong&gt;, the volume of UPI transactions grew rapidly from &lt;strong&gt;14.56 crore&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Dec 2017&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;456.63 crore&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Dec 2021&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it was not a happy ride for the confectionery industry, which registered subdued growth, as shown above, during the same period. But is it wise to draw a correlation between the two?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some have argued that the business model of the toffee industry was never based on the inefficiency of people to pay change, Abhishek Patil, founder of GrowthX, doesn’t agree. He claims, “Before UPI, shopkeepers would shamelessly trade toffees for loose cash, a transaction that wasn’t happening the other way round. With UPI, all of this stopped. People paid the exact amount that was due with no scope for change, ultimately eating up the daily toffee sales.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;608&quot; src=&quot;https://d3po6s2ufk88fh.cloudfront.net/1920x0/filters:no_upscale()/content-assets/f09f130bc0f04d5689d2edfd40b9274a.png&quot; width=&quot;826&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to him, popular candy brands such as Mondelez, Mars, Nestle, Perfetti Van Melle, Parle &amp;amp; ITC reported a steep decline in sales in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fairly simple answer, yet unconvincing of sorts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chhutta&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;was not the only source to sell their toffees, but is it enough to uproot the business model of these companies? We’re not sure. To add more weight to our uncertain assumptions, we decided to dig into some headlines:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;Parle Products&lt;/strong&gt;, a leading retailer of Kismi Toffee, Orange Bite, London Derry, and Mango Bite, registered a marginal CAGR of 0.4% in the confectionery market from 2017 to 2021. It stopped selling the 50-paise variant of these chocolates because business just wasn’t profitable in a 50-paise toffee in 2019. &lt;strong&gt;So, UPI was not the reason behind declining production.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
2) &lt;strong&gt;DS Group&lt;/strong&gt;, the maker of the much-loved Pulse candy, registered growth in profits and profit margins in 2021.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
3) &lt;strong&gt;Lotte&lt;/strong&gt; also reported record profit in 2021-22. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px&quot;&gt;By 2023, as UPI transaction volume grows to over 6,000 crore, the indigenous payment platform is set to account for more than 50 percent of India’s digital payments.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;It’s a hurdle relay race, damn it!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I talked about Alpenliebe, Mango Bite or a Kismi, for that matter, you must have been hit by a wave of nostalgia. Exactly my point! The dying trend of these toffees is not attributable only to the invention of UPI but to other converging trends as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that an Indian Diwali would be incomplete without the Cadbury ‘Celebrations’ pack, but lately, various other brands have stepped foot in the Indian market and are satisfying the taste buds of consumers. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Indians become increasingly health conscious, they move further away from sweet and sugary products to healthier alternatives. While the Indian manufacturers are starting to re-make their products, the international brands are already a step ahead. With their mix of international flavours and premium experience, the international brands are giving the local brands a run for their money.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some of the trends shaping the growth trajectory of global brands:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;Hershey’s&lt;/strong&gt; syrups and spreads sold like hot cakes during Covid as people took up baking to avoid boredom. It introduced its chocolate bar flavours in the form of mini chocolate bites in the same flavours, thus taking care of affordability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
2) &lt;strong&gt;Lindt&lt;/strong&gt; chocolate bars replaced local brands as a premium gifting option with a number of international flavours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major catalyst seems to be the chains like &lt;strong&gt;Laduree&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;House of Candy&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Chocolate Kingdom&lt;/strong&gt;, which are taking over traditional toffees as their kiosks and stores pop up in every nook and corner of malls, airports and other public places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;House of Candy boasts more than 200 stores across India and has also collaborated with names like Haldiram and Hamleys to supply its confectionery products, thereby expanding its customer base. Moreover, these brands offer premium and attractive gifting options, which is luring away consumers from purchasing local chocolates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The confectionery industry is taking a hit, but it won’t be long before Indian manufacturers completely remodel their offerings to cater to the mix of Indian and international flavours. For now, let’s give the ‘UPI killing toffee’ debate a rest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the toffee joke has been in the news before when the RBI released a document specifying the number of notes and coins of each denomination issued since 1970 in terms of billions of rupees. The figures revealed that the production of ₹1, ₹2 and ₹5 coins/notes have grown at a negligible rate during the 1970-2010 period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this does point out the irony of the toffee joke: Seven years ago, people wondered if toffees would be the new legal tender since they were so frequently handed out by shopkeepers in lieu of small change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And look how the tables have turned!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going by this trend, I wonder whether our future generation will ever know ‘&lt;em&gt;Melody itni chocolaty kyun hai?&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
