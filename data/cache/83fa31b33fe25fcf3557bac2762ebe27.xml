Part VIII is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/continuing-crisis-part-viii-mrna-vaccines-under-attack&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So what are things like inside the NIH at present? The situation has been chaotic, as is obvious to any outside observer. Like many other federal agencies, probationary employees were fired (since under federal hiring laws they could be!) and remember, that doesn&#39;t mean just new hires. People who had recently moved to different parts of the organization or who had been promoted were also in their probationary periods and were let go. The administration has been pretending that all such firings were for performance reasons, because again, that&#39;s how you can do this under the hiring rules. But this is an idiotic fiction, as shown by the similar probationary firings at the IRS. 7,000 such employees there were let go, and recent court filings in the lawsuits about these actions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-irs-firings-doge-fraud-law-job-performance&quot;&gt;have revealed&lt;/a&gt; an email from a lawyer at that agency warning that no performance reviews of any kind had been done and this maintaining that official reason was basically a fraudulent scheme. You can see how much that slowed things down.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One bit of good news has been that many federal agencies who did this sort of thing have been rehiring people under &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/mass-firings-federal-workers-trump-administration-7cc7320f469cc65529367aaea2fd9dcb&quot;&gt;court orders&lt;/a&gt; (at the FAA, USDA, and others). 250 such employees &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/article/nih-reinstates-some-its-early-career-scientists&quot;&gt;were rehired&lt;/a&gt; at the NIH, although no court order has forced HHS to do that yet. One thing to look out for, though, is that some parts of the government have been rehiring such people and immediately placing them on administrative leave to keep them from doing their jobs. On Monday of this week, though, a US District Judge &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5200424-trump-administration-probationary-workers/&quot;&gt;barred this move&lt;/a&gt;, saying that people had to be returned to their actual jobs. But that opens up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2025/03/19/probationary-federal-workers-fired-doge&quot;&gt;next phase&lt;/a&gt; of gutting the federal government, the more formal process of &quot;reductions in force&quot; (RIFs). At the NIH and other agencies, administrators &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/14/nih-staff-cuts-reorganization-morale/&quot;&gt;have been told&lt;/a&gt; to submit plans for such reductions this week, so that will be thing to look out for.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can easily see a theme here: one way or another, the administration wants to strip funding and people from the science-focused federal agencies, and they are working their way down the list of available methods. It&#39;s the same treatment that they&#39;re giving to universities - pull all grants that have language the administration doesn&#39;t like, cap indirect costs out of the blue retroactively, target specific universities (Johns Hopkins, Columbia, and this morning Penn) to have hundreds of millions of dollars of already-appropriated funds taken back from them. Study sections for grant renewals? Cancel them. OK, don&#39;t outright cancel them, but just don&#39;t publish the meeting notice in the Federal Register, so they can&#39;t take place anyway. Keep everyone in the dark about whether they&#39;ll happen or not. Delay, deny, confuse - whatever they can think of. Many of these actions are in fact specifically illegal and infringe on Congress&#39;s spending authority, but that is not slowing the Trump people down. It all goes to court, over and over, and in that time they can spread as much chaos, fear, and uncertainty as possible. It&#39;s not like the Republican Congress is worried about giving up their own authority - the head of the House Appropriations Committee (Tom Cole of Oklahoma) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/congress-doge-spending-tom-cole/682089/&quot;&gt;is on record&lt;/a&gt; saying that he doesn&#39;t care what the Executive Branch does with spending. Constitution be damned, apparently.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I have recent word from contacts inside the NIH about how this sort of thing works on the ground there. Travel is still banned, for one thing, and the hiring freeze is still in place (and that reaches down to post-doctoral positions and to grad students). You&#39;ll recall how the purchasing system there was one of the first things that felt this administration&#39;s delicate touch, and how for a while there people didn&#39;t know if they&#39;d be able to order food for lab animals or get liquid nitrogen to keep instruments running. Well, purchasing was supposedly straightened out not long after that and is allowed. . .but I&#39;ve seen a memo to employees there saying that the Acquisition Management and Operations Branch (AMOB) is only able to execute a limited number of requests per day. People inside the Division of Intramural Research (the in-house research groups) have been told in so many words that &quot;&lt;em&gt;the vast majority of our legitimate DIR ordering needs are not currently able to be fulfilled&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. So they&#39;re having to triage and try to get spending done that directly impacts human and animal safety and ongoing clinical research. Everything else, they are told is &quot;&lt;em&gt;exceedingly unlikely to make the cut&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, so there go your lab supplies. A root cause of this seems to have been the loss of many of the purchasing agents themselves - there just aren&#39;t enough people to do the work. This is clearly by design, and is another part of the overall policy of slow strangulation. Firing probationary employees was a start, the RIFs are coming next, and maybe if they make things unpleasant and impossible enough more people will leave of their own accord, out of desperation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is a crime, of course, on many levels. I am cheering on the court cases that are attempting to reverse as much of this as possible, but it&#39;s clear that the administration still has a number of legal means to try to vandalize the nation&#39;s science infrastructure. And they&#39;re going to use them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/continuing-crisis-part-ix-inside-nih-now</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/continuing-crisis-part-ix-inside-nih-now</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 11:43:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>How Much Does Math Help Chemistry Students?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;How much mathematics does a working chemist (or biologist) use, anyway? And how much do you need to know? That question has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/bones-world&quot;&gt;come up&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/it-not-hard-peddle-incoherent-math-biologists&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; several &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/don-t-learn-science&quot;&gt;times&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/why-are-you-forcing-my-son-take-chemistry&quot;&gt;the years&lt;/a&gt;, and it is not without its controversy. That&#39;s partly because there are many types of chemist - a physical or theoretical chemist is clearly going to be much more mathematically oriented than a synthetic organic one, and I speak from experience as one of the latter. E. O. Wilson &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/e-o-wilson-s-letters-young-scientist&quot;&gt;used to say&lt;/a&gt; that a great many famous scientists were &quot;mathematically only semiliterate&quot;, and he was (in my estimation) correct. But as some of those links above go into, a general idea of mathematical principles really is helpful for keeping your thoughts in order and in understanding what you&#39;re seeing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a related question that&#39;s addressed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/jacsau.4c01126&quot;&gt;this new paper&lt;/a&gt;: how much does mathematical knowledge help you when you&#39;re learning chemistry in the first place? The authors are looking at the interactions of over 600,000 students with the Open Learning Initiative courseware for general chemistry, and trying to see how their progress (and their interactions with various key components of the course material) track with both the amount of math involved in each topic and with the students&#39; previous mathematical training. In the past, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1144214&quot;&gt;some studies&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that prior training in chemistry, physics, or biology per se didn&#39;t seem to show many cross-disciplinary advantages in learning either of the other two subjects, but that prior &lt;em&gt;mathematical&lt;/em&gt; training helped out with all of them (even non-math-intensive courses like introductory biology). Such a link has been reported many times specifically for chemistry students - &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-024-10137-5&quot;&gt;see this paper&lt;/a&gt; for a recent summary and references to that literature.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So the authors here were rather surprised by their own results. They found that learning rates, as measured by progress through and interaction with the courseware, seem to be &lt;em&gt;almost totally&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; of prior mathematical knowledge and of the amount of mathematics in any particular part of the course. But it&#39;s also important to realize that the less-well-prepared students still have disadvantages, because even if those learning rates are the same, they truly are starting out at a lower level than their classmates and thus they generally end up at one, too, since everyone has been moving along roughly equally along the way. But one might have expected the better-mathematically-prepared students to have been able to pick up the material more quickly based on the existing literature in this area, and that wasn&#39;t really the case, although they do indeed start out at an advantage.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But the advent of online learning and the data it provides have been suggesting this - some of these same authors &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2221311120&quot;&gt;had already noted&lt;/a&gt; surprisingly consistent learning rates across different academic subjects. And as with this chemistry-focused work, that study also suggested that since students clearly need multiple learning opportunities to be sure of picking up new material, that making sure that enough of these are provided during a course might be a be better thing to focus on rather than (say) recommending remedial work before taking on a particular subject. You&#39;d think that with the &quot;leg up&quot; type results seen here that such courses would be a good answer, but the literature on their effectiveness is decidedly mixed, with some studies showing that they can do actual harm (!) My own take is that this current paper&#39;s result probably holds strongest for introductory courses, but then, you don&#39;t have too many natural experiments of someone taking Organic without having had introductory chemistry, or coming into a Differential Equations course without having had calculus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And as the paper notes, the prior results suggesting that mathematical knowledge is a key factor for success in early chemistry courses have some ambiguity in them as well. It could be the case that such training is beneficial overall for organized thinking and knowledge acquisition in the sciences, but it could also be true that it&#39;s correlated with previous exposure to chemistry knowledge as well, and that this prior knowledge is indeed an advantage (which then gets ascribed mistakenly to mathematical training). But one thing seems pretty clear: using your intuition on what might work best in such educational topics, in the absence of empirical data, is a recipe for trouble. . .&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/how-much-does-math-help-chemistry-students</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/how-much-does-math-help-chemistry-students</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 02:53:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Continuing Crisis, Part VIII: mRNA Vaccines Under Attack</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: this is one of a series of posts on the current attacks on science by the Trump administration. Part VII is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/continuing-crisis-part-vii-overview&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I have not written on this topic since my (gloomy and angry) overview over a week ago, but unfortunately, that is not because things have been improving. Outside of the sciences, we are indeed heading straight for the defying-judicial-orders territory that will be a turning point (one way or another) in this story. What&#39;s more, we&#39;re barrelling towards that simultaneously in several different cases, which is probably a strategy on the administration&#39;s part. There have been some bits of good news (with several agencies re-hiring fired probationary employees under such court orders), but the overall trend is Not Good At All, to a degree that many members of the general public have not caught up to yet.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But today I&#39;m talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/nih-grants-mrna-vaccines-trump-administration-hhs-rfk/&quot;&gt;this new article&lt;/a&gt; from the Kaiser foundation, which bears directly and intolerably on the usual subjects of this site. The article (which definitely seems well-sourced and is all too believable) reports that NIH-funded researchers are being told to remove all mentions of mRNA vaccines work from their grant applications. There is some fear that existing grants in the area may be cancelled, and let&#39;s not forget that that itself would be an illegal and unconstitutional misappropriation of funds and is in fact, one of the ways this whole circus kicked off in late January.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As you may know, the NIH has already cancelled all work on vaccine hesitancy, with a letter from acting director Mark Memoli saying that the agency was simply not interested in the topic or in any ways to improve vaccine uptake, and that all work in this area was ceasing. The KFF team has now seen a similar letter from Memoli directing that &quot;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;any grants, contracts, or collaborations involving mRNA vaccines be reported up the chain to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s office and the White House&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. Think about that for a moment, and how strange it is: you pick out a single research technology, one that has nothing to do with the hot-button diversity and inclusion issues that the administration starting attacking from the beginning. And any work on it now has to be brought to the attention of the acting Director, and then to his boss running HHS, and from him up to White House Staff. Why the hell do people at the White House level concern themselves with messenger RNA?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Well, because the conspiracy-addled base of voters concern themselves with it. Many of you will have seen the stuff, starting back during the pandemic and never going away, all about how the mRNA vaccines are (let&#39;s see now) secret attempts at population control, designed to alter human DNA and create a new species, built to track and bar-code individual citizens and report their movements, a plot to turn all such vaccine recipients into the intellectual and physical property of the evil pharma companies, deadly poison that &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;&gt;has rampaged&lt;/span&gt;, was &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;&gt;going to rampage on several selected datas&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;em&gt;still is&lt;/em&gt; going to rampage Real Soon Now through its untold millions of hapless recipients and turn them into corpses/zombies/whatever and so on &lt;em&gt;ad nauseum&lt;/em&gt;. There is a very loud cohort of Trump voters that believe one or more of these things, which is why Trump himself, who used to take credit for the speed of the vaccine development program (even though Pfizer and BioNTech weren&#39;t part of it) pivoted away from it during the campaign.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And they&#39;re not all Trump voters, either, thanks to the horseshoe effect that brings the ultra-crunchy Left around to meet the conspiratorial Right on these topics. I live in an area that&#39;s has a bizarrely high percentage of people with postgraduate degrees of all sorts, and the local social media had people on it who were just Soooo Happy when RFK, Jr. was confirmed as head of HHS. Perhaps it was one of those people who posted the other day wondering if anyone knew where they could get food and ingredients without mRNA in it. And &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;God only knows what Kennedy himself believes about the stuff. But whatever it is it&#39;s likely to be horribly mistaken, because his views on traditional vaccines are already a soufflé of bullshit, so I&#39;m sure that this newer technology really gives him some scope for his talents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But look at where this leaves us: consider the recent posts here about neoantigen therapy for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/progress-rna-based-cancer-vaccines&quot;&gt;pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt;, or about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/single-base-editing-seems-work&quot;&gt;single-base gene editing&lt;/a&gt; for rare diseases, or against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/vaccine-progress-against-c-diff&quot;&gt;C-diff infections&lt;/a&gt;. All of those are mRNA-based, and there&#39;s a lot more where those came from. And there are of course so many infectious-disease vaccines being worked on through mRNA vectors, from HIV through dengue all the way to Epstein-Barr virus, which infection looks more and more like the root cause of multiple sclerosis. And the largest government-funded biomedical research organization in the world is telling scientists that they&#39;d better watch their step and report all such work to their superiors, and it might be ready to can the work altogether. Meanwhile, Republican-controlled legislatures in a number of states &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/newsletters/prescription-pulse/2025/03/11/states-eye-mrna-vaccine-limits-for-a-hesitant-public-00223025&quot;&gt;are working on&lt;/a&gt; bills of their own to restrict or ban mRNA vaccines outright.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;painfully, suicidally craven and stupid&lt;/em&gt;. I&#39;m sorry, but I have no other way to state it. Some of the people pushing this garbage truly believe it, in which case they have allowed themselves to be misled by lies and conspiracy theories. Some of them either don&#39;t believe it or don&#39;t care much one way or another so long as they continue to get votes and campaign donations. And I need to add another explanation that is becoming increasingly common in the Second Trump Era, and note that some people very likely are in &lt;em&gt;outright fear for their own safety or that of their families and staff&lt;/em&gt; if they do not go along with this nonsense.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of this is no way to conduct medical research. And it&#39;s no way to run a functioning democratic republic, either. What are we turning into? Day by day, week by week: &lt;em&gt;what are we turning into?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/continuing-crisis-part-viii-mrna-vaccines-under-attack</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/continuing-crisis-part-viii-mrna-vaccines-under-attack</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:22:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Crystallization Cages</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-025-01750-x&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s a paper&lt;/a&gt; from the Fujita group at the University of Tokyo that follows up on a long-running project there: getting X-ray crystal structures of compounds without crystallizing them at all. They first reported this phenomenon over ten years ago (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/x-ray-structures-everything-without-crystals-holy-cow&quot;&gt;time flies!&lt;/a&gt;) and it works by soaking the molecules of interest into metal-organic-framework (MOF) crystals. Under the right conditions, the guest molecules line up inside the vast coordination cage of the MOF crystals in such a regular fashion that when you do X-ray diffraction on them, you not only get the MOF framework (as expected) but you also get data from diffraction of the guest molecules. They have become part of the crystal, and you can solve their structures accordingly. (A follow-up post at the time is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/crystallography-without-crystallizing-update&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: I have done some work in this field, which came to no great results for several reasons that I won&#39;t go into (!) But we were able to reproduce this effect sporadically with some of our own MOFs. A major difficulty was that every guest molecule threatened to become its own research project; general conditions were very hard to arrive at. I was hoping for a situation a bit like chiral chromatography columns are in now, where you&#39;d say &quot;OK, for that kind of molecule I&#39;d try the XYZ column first, and if that doesn&#39;t work, then the ABC one, and you can always break out the JKL and see if that does the trick&quot; - that sort of thing, but with a list of likely MOF crystals. But we didn&#39;t get that far ourselves. The dream, of course, is that you could solve the structures of natural products, metabolites and all sorts of other compounds that might be available only in small quantities and not easily crystallized by just soaking-and-shooting.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/mh/c8mh00302e&quot;&gt;have been&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/structure-molecular-sponge&quot;&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.9b10501&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.7b06607&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; over the years as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/guidelines-mof-crystallography&quot;&gt;advice&lt;/a&gt; about how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32890-0&quot;&gt;best&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.accounts.3c00243&quot;&gt;handle&lt;/a&gt; the resulting X-ray diffraction &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c05561&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;, and my general impression is that other groups have struggled with the same problems of generality. This latest paper has some impressive structures in it, though, and they cover an impressive range. They&#39;re using a palladium-containing MOF that&#39;s very similar to their original report, but this one has been modified by the addition of a flat tetrasulfonate compound in the crystallization conditions. As they note, this is a pretty big symmetry mismatch, and that&#39;s by design. They believe that the lower success rate in detecting guests in the original MOF cage was due to its high symmetry (a cubic space group) that made modeling the electron density of included guests difficult unless they had very high occupancy in the various coordination sites. Adding the tetrasulfonate compound gives a new cocrystal in a very low-symmetry space group (P1) where guest molecules are much easier to get a handle on because of the lack of symmetry elements in the basic repeating unit. The new channels that form in this structure are a also good size for guest inclusion and can accommodate large molecules than can work their way into the original cage.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.z6quhy0/rss/mofs-1741887217567.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;They demonstrate this first with the steroid methyl androstenediol. A single MOF crystal exposed to twenty micrograms of the compound delivered good X-ray diffraction data, including the absolute chirality of the guest molecule via interactions with the heavy atoms in the MOF framework. You can see it and two other molecules packed into the MOF at right. Two of the steroid molecules occupy the &quot;original&quot; cavity of the MOF simultaneously, but you can see two other very different small molecules pack in other ways. Interestingly, they tried the experiment two ways - soaking into a preformed low-symmetry MOF, or letting the original high-symmetry cage interact with guest molecules in solution, followed by addition of the tetrasulfonate and crystallization. The methyl androstenediol 3a showed up in almost the same orientation either way, while the 3c tryptophan derivative showed up outside the cage in the soaking experiment and inside it in the crystallization one. Meanwhile the 3b compound, with its hydrophobic tail, didn&#39;t work well by the crystallization method at all, but did show up during soaking. But overall the authors say that the crystallization idea is more successful and needs less tweaking than the soaking conditions, although it will need more material.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The paper goes on to show the successful structure determination of a variety of molecules, with a whole range of polarity, size, and functionality (things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monensin&quot;&gt;monensin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levosulpiride&quot;&gt;levosulpiride&lt;/a&gt; for example) As someone who has worked in the field, I&#39;m impressed by the things that they&#39;ve gotten to work, which range up to large natural product like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitonin&quot;&gt;digitonin&lt;/a&gt;. For that one they got the whole structure except for a middle carbohydrate that seems to have been too distant from the framework to be ordered. One effect that they noted was that the most hydrophobic parts of such large guests tend to sequester into the cage part of the structure, while the rest finds a place out in the channel. In some cases they could confirm this behavior in solution via NMR spectra. And they present another low-symmetry cage which yielded a structure of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifampicin&quot;&gt;rifampicin&lt;/a&gt; derivative.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that there is still no universal MOF cage for these crystallography experiments, but it also strongly suggests that the situation I mentioned earlier (&quot;Here, try this one, and if that doesn&#39;t work, try this one too&quot;) may be within reach. I&#39;m very happy to see things getting to this point, and I hope to see others trying this technique out. And in case anyone&#39;s wondering, no, I would not have achieved this result in my own project in any reasonable amount of time! But I can testify that working with MOFs is tremendously enjoyable in the lab if you appreciate crystals, and what chemist doesn&#39;t?

That&#39;s widely regarded as a first major clinical test of a PROTAC-style degrader, so let me spend a paragraph or two going over once more what the heck those are. Skip ahead if you&#39;re already a Bifunctional Kind of Person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The idea behind these odd-looking molecules is to hijack an important pathway inside cells that destroys unwanted proteins and recycles their amino acids. That&#39;s done in a tube-shaped structure called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome&quot;&gt;proteasome&lt;/a&gt;, whose inner wall is lined with a variety of broad-spectrum protease enzymes, making it a pretty exact analog of one of those things they feed junked cars into to recover their materials. Proteins are marked for destruction though being tagged with chains of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin&quot;&gt;ubiquitin&lt;/a&gt;, itself a small protein that can be enzymatically linked with exposed lysine residues on the desired target (and then chained along with more ubiquitins that are added to lysine residues on those ubiquitin tags themselves). This ubiquitination is found everywhere in proteomics, as the name implies, and there&#39;s a whole grammar/code of where these Ub residues are added and how the resulting Ub chains are constructed. But a major function of ubiquitination is as this sort of &quot;red waste tag&quot; that sends tagged proteins into the maw of the proteasome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These bifunctionals (now commonly known as PROTACs, for &quot;proteolysis targeting chimeras&quot;) consist of a ligand for the target protein and a ligand for some key protein in the ubiquitination machinery, linked together into one molecule. Such a molecule binds to its target with one end, and attracts the Ub complex with the other, and the proximity this induces allows the ubiquitination complex to start slapping ubiquitins on this protein it suddenly finds itself next to, no matter if it&#39;s a normal substrate for it or not. And thus the target protein is hauled off to the proteasome and destroyed, and if proteins could express surprise and dismay, these surely would! Meanwhile the small-molecule PROTAC, not being a protein itself, is not destroyed in the proteasome and survives to go back and do this to another molecule of target protein - this catalytic mechanism is a valuable feature, since the PROTACS themselves tend to be rather large and unwieldy molecules whose blood levels and cellular penetration are often not wonderful to start with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.zj062ka/rss/arv471-1741810467180.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;The structure of ARV-471 is shown at right. The left-hand site is a ligand for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen_receptor_alpha&quot;&gt;estrogen receptor alpha &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen_receptor_alpha&quot;&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; (ER-alpha), then there&#39;s a piperidine-based lined over to an imide portion of the molecule that binds to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereblon&quot;&gt;cereblon&lt;/a&gt;, which is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin_ligase&quot;&gt;E3 ligase&lt;/a&gt; part of a ubiquitination complex. This is a very typical-looking bifunctional degrader. The target ER has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41523-023-00533-2&quot;&gt;rather complex biology&lt;/a&gt; in breast cancer, but it has already been demonstrated over the years in clinical practice that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulvestrant&quot;&gt;fulvestrant&lt;/a&gt;, a drug that causes breakdown of the ER-alpha receptor via a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15865849&quot;&gt;somewhat different mechanism&lt;/a&gt;, can be beneficial in some patients (specifically those with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2705275/&quot;&gt;ER+/HER2-&lt;/a&gt; tumors who have already been through other therapies).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So this trial was a well-aimed head-to-head comparison in that patient population between fulvestrant and vepdegestrant: the former an established drug that works by lowering the amount and activity of ER-apha protein versus the new mechanism that has been demonstrated in cells and animal models to lower the levels of ER-alpha via targeted protein degradation (TPD). The questions are: does this TPD molecule actually work in human patients? And is it more effective than fulvestrant?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ir.arvinas.com/news-releases/news-release-details/arvinas-and-pfizer-announce-positive-topline-results-phase-3&quot;&gt;The answers&lt;/a&gt; to those appear to be &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;Maybe not&quot;, at least as the data stand. Arvinas and Pfizer state in their press release that there was a statistically significant improvement in overall survival compared to fulvestrant, but not in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5654877/&quot;&gt;intent-to-treat&lt;/a&gt; population. And ITT really is the gold standard, because it preserves the readout from the original randomization of patients in a clinical trial regardless of later actions or decisions. If you want to be really hardcore about this - and I would say that that is the entire point of a randomized binded clinical trial - then intention-to-treat is where you have to make your case. Otherwise the door is opened to &quot;Well, those folks were actually more like this this thing over here&quot; and &quot;If you exclude the ones who did such-and-such&quot; rationales. And those are not always wrong, but they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; always a risk for wishful thinking. (If such rationales are in fact correct, then a redesigned trial should provide you with the solid numbers that you really need). The press release notes that the trial is still collecting overall survival data, and I suppose that there is an outside chance that things could look more convincing than they do now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So what we&#39;re seeing is that the first TPD drug does indeed work, and that&#39;s good news for the field. But what we&#39;re not seeing is it showing any real advantage over its most relevant competition, which is of course not such great news, because the hopes have been that this new mechanism could deliver a difference like that. What this readout &lt;em&gt;shouldn&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; do is make people nervous about TPD and PROTACS as a whole. This is one drug, in one disease. There are a huge number of variables in making such degraders, and we truly do not understand them very well. A different PROTAC for the estrogen receptor&amp;nbsp;could in fact work better than this one, or it could be worse. The only way to find out is in the clinic in real patients. And any PROTAC that&#39;s aimed at a different target in a different disease (and there are quite a few) will be a story all its own - and those stories are still being written.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/bifunctional-degrader-reads-out-phase-3</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/bifunctional-degrader-reads-out-phase-3</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:08:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>New Synthetic Antibiotics</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.zehi8xm/rss/antibiotics-1741730948860.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;There&#39;s been an interesting collaboration for the last several years between the Myers lab at Harvard and the Polikanov lab at Illinois-Chicago on new antibiotic ideas. In 2021 the team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8549432&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a variation on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clindamycin&quot;&gt;clindamycin&lt;/a&gt;, dubbed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iboxamycin&quot;&gt;iboxamycin&lt;/a&gt;, which I blogged about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/clindamycin-21st-century&quot;&gt;at the time&lt;/a&gt;. Last year they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk8013&quot;&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; another compound in this series, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cresomycin&quot;&gt;cresomycin&lt;/a&gt;, and now they&#39;re out with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-025-01738-7&quot;&gt;another paper&lt;/a&gt; moving the story along even further.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The structures are shown at right, and if you look up clindamycin itself (link above) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincomycin&quot;&gt;lincomycin&lt;/a&gt; you can see where the series came from, the &quot;lincosamide&quot; antibiotics. Both of those have been around since the 1960s - lincomycin was the natural product, and clindamycin was synthesized from it by chlorinating at an OH center (that same chloro that you see carried along in iboxamycin at the top of the illustration). Clindamycin is &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14762701/&quot;&gt;generally&lt;/a&gt; the more active of the two, but they both have the same mechanism, as you&#39;d expect, which is inhibition of the pathogen&#39;s ribosome and thus protein synthesis. Specifically, they bind to the 23S &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptidyl_transferase_center&quot;&gt;peptidyl transferase&lt;/a&gt; subunit, which interestingly is not a protein enzyme at all, but rather a ribozyme composed completely of RNA. That fact by itself brought on the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world&quot;&gt;RNA world&lt;/a&gt;&quot; hypothesis for the origins of life, since here is a key enzyme vital to all known forms of life as far back as we can see which is RNA-based. This mechanisms extends beyond bacterial to protozoans; in combinations clindamycin can be used to treat malaria or babesiosis, for example.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These antibiotics are not outright bacteriocidal, unless you can get them up to high concentrations, but are rather bacteriostatic. Antibiotic developers tend to prefer the former, but clindamycin still has plenty of uses, especially against aerobic cocci like &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/em&gt; and many anaerobic Gram-negative rod-like species. A notable complication can be the bloom of&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Clostridioides difficile (bacteria)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridioides_difficile_(bacteria)&quot;&gt;Clostridioides difficile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; (&quot;C diff&quot;) in the intestines after oral treatment, because that species is completely resistant to the antibiotic and can take over, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/vaccine-progress-against-c-diff&quot;&gt;bad effects&lt;/a&gt;. And there is of course resistance. There&#39;s a whole set of mutations that can confer resistance to clindamycin (interfering with its binding or pumping it back out of the bacteria themselves, and these overlap with resistance to a lot of other ribosome-binding antibiotics. And that&#39;s not good, because there are a lot of really important ones in that broad class.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite many efforts, no one has been able to advance a new lincosamide into human use for over fifty years, and that&#39;s what this team is trying to change. Iboxamycin features tighter binding to the ribosome peptidyl transferase via that bicyclic structure (an oxepanoprolinamide). Cresomycin holds on to that feature but rigidifies the &quot;northern&quot; part of the structure in an unusual ten-membered ring, and that modification gives it a pretty impressive spectrum of antibacterial action, including efficacy against many resistant strains. The authors have gone back to work in that region of the structure to produce the latest iteration, BT-33, adding a fluorinated carbon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That change doesn&#39;t really affect binding to the ribosome - what it does is slow down metabolic clearance of the thioglycoside next to it. The extra fluorinated methylene group greatly increases stability to liver microsomes, and the chirality there matters a great deal: BT-33&#39;s fluorine atom makes a van der Waals contact with the ribosome for binding, and is also arranged to provide the maximum shielding of the thioether from oxidative metabolism. The team shows SAR data for several different macrocycles and stereochemistries, and you can see that (for example) the 9- and 12-membered ring analogs are much less active, as are the ones where the double bond stereochemistry is E instead of Z as shown.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a panel of MIC assays against a range of pathogens, BT-33 is at least equal in potency to Cresomycin, and and many cases notably better. It&#39;s very much more effective against large panels of clinical isolates, which should be good news out in the real world, especially since these include a number of very nasty resistant strains. and it has improved half-life after iv dosing in rodents. The authors make some important points in the conclusion:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;When reviewed, the pathway of chronological discovery from lincomycin to CLI, IBX, CRM and now BT-33 makes evident the value of preorganization by structural rigidification as well as the importance of improved engagement with the molecular target, the bacterial ribosome, at least in this chemical series, if not more generally. Consistently, we have observed that as engagement with the ribosome has improved, so too has activity against Gram-negative bacterial strains, which was not expected. The discovery process has been evolutionary and has benefited to an extent from serendipity. It is unlikely that a molecule such as BT-33, had it been conceived at the outset of our studies, would have been selected for chemical synthesis in light of its structural complexity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is why you run the experiments, for sure! And why you let the results of those experiments tell you where to go next. We are still not good enough to predict useful drugs by calling our shots right at the beginning of a project - you have to work your way up there and be willing to be surprised along the way. Serendipity is no disgrace! But failing to take advantage of it certainly is! BT-33 is now being &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.4c11270&quot;&gt;scaled up&lt;/a&gt; for preclinical development, and I hope it makes it through. We could use some agents to surprise the bacteria that are waiting for us out there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/new-synthetic-antibiotics</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/new-synthetic-antibiotics</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:26:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Single-Base Editing Seems to Work</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/clinical-trial-readouts-are-comin&quot;&gt;not long ago&lt;/a&gt; that I was looking forward to seeing how Beam Therapeutics would do in their clinical trials of single-base DNA editing therapies, and this morning &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.beamtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beam-therapeutics-announces-positive-initial-data-beam-302-phase&quot;&gt;we have a readout&lt;/a&gt;. This was a trial to correct alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), which is a genetically based condition involving a mutation in the SERPINA1 gene. The alpha-1 antitrypsin is a protease-inhibiting protein that blocks the activity of the neutrophil elastase enzyme - that&#39;s a mechanism you see in some biochemical systems, where an enzyme and another protein that continuously blocks its activity are produced at the same time. Regulation then takes place by changing the amount, localization, or conformational state of the inhibitor protein, turning the enzyme loose to do its thing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you don&#39;t have that inhibitor in this case, the unleashed neutrophil elastase definitely goes on to cause trouble. AATD patients generally show lung and liver problems, on a spectrum of severity which depends on the mutation(s) involved and whether they are on both copies of the gene or just one. The lung damage (often emphysema or COPD) is due to the unconstrained elastase activity, while the liver damage (cirrhosis) is mostly due to excess mutant AAT protein piling up in the cells where it&#39;s produced. At the far end of the severity scale, you&#39;re looking at lung or liver transplants as the only option. And there are several other less-common syndromes also associated with the deficiency, which has been generally underdiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This trial was in patients with lung symptoms who have the worst form of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7886062/&quot;&gt;most common mutation&lt;/a&gt; associated with the severe form of the disease, the &quot;PiZZ&quot; genotype (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dovepress.com/alpha-1-antitrypsin-piz-gene-frequency-and-pizz-genotype-numbers-world-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-COPD&quot;&gt;two copies&lt;/a&gt; of the &quot;Z allele&quot;). That one is a single-nucleotide polymorphism, &lt;span&gt;Glu342Lys, so it&#39;s an ideal candidate for Beam&#39;s new-generation single-base-editing CRISPR technology. (Protein aficionados will note that an acidic glutamate has been swapped in for a basic lysine and will not be surprised to find that this could cause malfunctions!) There are about 100,000 such people in the US. The BEAM-302 treatment, then, has a guide RNA along with another mRNA sequence that produces the base-editing protein system itself, with the idea being that a single treatment could fix a large number of cells and cause them to produce the normal form of alpha-1-antitrypsin (which these ZZ patients completely lack). There appears to be a disease threshold for the levels of the normal protein; if you can get it above 11 micromolar in the blood you are protected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was a very small trial: three patients each got 15mg, 30mg, or 60mg of BEAM-302 (a lipid nanoparticle formuation) in a single infusion. But this is one of those large-effect-size situations, since the difference between having no functioning AAT and having enough to get over the protective threshold is enormous (on the order of &quot;do you have a left leg, or not?&quot;) No real toxicity problems showed up - a few patients had transient liver enzyme elevations as the bolus of LNPs hit, but these seem to have resolved quickly. The total AAT concentrations in their blood went up by 1.6x, 1.9x, and 2.8x in the three groups, and the amount of mutant AAT also decreased (down 11% and 38% in the first two groups, with one patient in the high-dose group showing a 78% decrease). The high-dose group had an average AAT concentration of 12.4 micromolar, above the protective threshold, which would under current definitions would mean that they no longer have the disease. All of these effects started to kick in after about a week, and plateaued at the three-week mark, where (so far) they seem to remain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As you&#39;d expect, the company is quickly moving to try even higher doses (since there was a reasonable dose-response with no show-stopping tox, and the highest group in this run managed to clear the bar). We should see results from that work later this year. There is also a second phase to this trial that will start in ZZ patients who are showing liver symptoms. That should be interesting to watch, considering that all of these IV infusions of LLP-formulated RNAs are piling into the liver directly anyway, pharmacokinetically speaking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So things look good in these early readouts, I have to say. It is of course a small number of patients, but the data make sense, and the numbers clearly seem to be going in the right direction. We&#39;ll see how high&amp;nbsp;the dosage can go, and whether the dose-response holds up there as well. And with time, we&#39;ll see how long-lasting the effect is. You would certainly hope that a population of normal liver cells has been established which will now stay with these patients for the rest of their lives - and what an advance that will be. Good luck to all involved!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit: I should note that Beam has single-cell editing trials underway in adult sickle cell disease and glycogen storage disease, among other programs. It should be an eventful year for them!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/single-base-editing-seems-work</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/single-base-editing-seems-work</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 11:32:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Bird is the (Geomagnetic) Word</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Now here&#39;s a topic that I don&#39;t think has come up here before. There are a number of different living creatures - but not us - who can sense magnetic fields, and they use the Earth&#39;s intrinsic geomagnetic field as a navigation aid. This has been seen in &lt;a href=&quot;https://hal.science/cea-02378779&quot;&gt;bacteria and other microorganisms&lt;/a&gt; all the way to birds, who use the magnetic field to do their long-range migrations. You can even see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.allaboutbirds.org/news/geomagnetic-disturbances-and-wrong-way-bird-migrations/&quot;&gt;disruptions in bird locations&lt;/a&gt; after a big sunspot-induced geomagnetic storm!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But how do animals sense magnetic field lines in the first place? For bacteria the answer is usually pretty straightforward: there are a number of species that actually biomineralize iron-containing materials at one end of their bodies, and they appear to sense small positional changes in these crystals in response to the local magnetic fields. There is a special organelle dubbed the &quot;magnetosome&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S259015242100009X&quot;&gt;where this happens&lt;/a&gt;, and the resulting crystals occur in very reproducible shapes and sizes. There are a few protozoans that have demonstrated magnetic sensitivity as well, but as far as I&#39;m aware those manage to gain that ability by eating some magnetosensitive bacteria and appropriating their hardware. Crude, but effective.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But birds are apparently a different matter, because no one has found similar iron-containing cells in them. A few years back it was reported that some types of pigeon have small hematite crystals in their beaks, but it looks like these results have &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6769297/&quot;&gt;come under question&lt;/a&gt; after repeated attempts at replication. A more recent hypothesis is that cryptochrome proteins in bird eyes can (in response to some wavelengths) produce stable radical pairs that are very sensitive to changes in the magnetic field (in much the same way that we chemists do EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) experiments on free radicals). In this case the birds might be sensing population shifts between single and triplet radical states in the pair. Yep, sheer quantum mechanics, at work in a migratory bird near you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Any explanation will also have to account for some other odd experimental facts: birds don&#39;t seem to notice or care whether or not they&#39;re navigating by a South or North polarity. Instead, they are sensitive to inclination of the field lines, and thus have more of a sense of whether they&#39;re heading towards the equator or towards either pole. They&#39;re also sensitive to sudden changes (in either direction) of magnetic field intensity, but can regain their bearings after having had some time to adjust to the new fields. And the cryptochrome idea comes in to connect to a third oddity: birds can magnetonavigate under light wavelengths from near UV up to about 565 nm (yellow-green), but under yellow, orange, and red light they are disoriented. It&#39;s also been shown &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1513391113&quot;&gt;in some species&lt;/a&gt; that the circular polarization of sunlight is a factor in aligning the magnetic navigation system.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acschembio.4c00576&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; has the latest, and its introduction provides a much more detailed set of references than I&#39;m giving here. The authors are zeroing in on the ErCry4a protein in the European robin, and demonstrate how this nominally cytosolic species can in fact anchor itself to the membrane under physiologic conditions, ending up in an oriented (and movement-restricted) state that would be suitable for detecting magnetic fields under radical-pair conditions. The C-terminal tail of the protein imbeds into the polar-head-group layer of model membranes, and this provides the first demonstration that such a species can end up in a plausible magnetoresponsive state in the cell. Recent work that shows that the European robin&#39;s double-cone photoreceptor cells display regular order suggest that this might be the template needed, but the authors mention that they would like to confirm that experimentally and to look for other proteins that might associate with ErCry4a in such a location.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So we might be getting closer to figuring out how birds do it. There could well be differences species-to-species, and you&#39;d expect to see more robust biochemical navigation machinery in the ones that have regular, crucial, and strenuous migrations as part of their life cycles (as opposed to some tropical birds who stay relatively close to home across the seasons). We&#39;re heading (finally) into Spring in North America, and as the birds return to your forests and back yards, spare a thought for how they&#39;ve been following sensations based on magnetic fields and polarized light, and for how limited our own sensory apparatus can be. There&#39;s a lot more to the world than what we can directly sense.

&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;I’ve been planning a post like this one, where I address how. . .&lt;em&gt;unusual&lt;/em&gt;. . .the site has been lately, with all the updates on government actions, judicial proceedings, and various loud statements about current affairs. But I’m not the only person who usually writes about something else who has been pulled into these issues, and Mike Masnick’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/2025/03/04/why-techdirt-is-now-a-democracy-blog-whether-we-like-it-or-not/&quot;&gt;recent post at Techdirt&lt;/a&gt; really does a great job of summing it up. As he says, that site is now a democracy blog, by force of circumstances. Like me, he’s been fielding questions from some readers about “&lt;em&gt;Why all the politics, I come here to read about science&lt;/em&gt;”, but I think this sums it up:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot; style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;When the very institutions that made American innovation possible are being systematically dismantled, it’s not a “political” story anymore. It’s a story about whether the environment that enabled all the other stories we cover will continue to exist. . .&lt;span&gt;This isn’t about politics — it’s about the systematic dismantling of the very infrastructure that made American innovation possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Exactly. The Trump administration (in the person of Elon Musk in particular) has simultaneously attacked all the federal agencies that fund scientific research and use any pretexts available to cut their funding and fire their staff. This is, to be sure, the opening of a broader attack on the government in general, but as I said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/rare-diseases-fda-here-it-comes&quot;&gt;the other day&lt;/a&gt;, it’s important to note the priority assigned to the science agencies. USAID took the first broadsides because of Musk’s particular hatred for that organization (and that’s the accurate description of his feelings), but the NIH, NSF &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. were next. Only after that did he address some of the other agencies that inconvenience the lives of billionaires - the IRS, the EPA, and more. So let’s talk about this in a bit more detail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;1. The Scope of the Problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The first thing to realize about all this is that it is unprecedented. By now that seems clear to those of us who’ve been following the story, but there are large parts of the public that don’t realize this part yet. The problem is deep, and it is wide. These are not the usual budget cuts, which much of the time in politics are nothing more than lower increases than expected, and these are not the usual cries from people who feel that their particular budget is being unfairly targeted. &lt;i&gt;No one has ever ripped into scientific funding like this&lt;/i&gt;. The Trump team has attacked it as if it were some evil imposed on us by an invading enemy, and the damage is so large and so widespread already that it’s hard to even explain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Preparation for next year’s flu vaccine has to start taking place now, but that process has been halted. Grant money that has been going to university research groups and medical centers all fifty states has been throttled. There are clinical trials have been stopped in their tracks. Reviews of new drugs before the FDA have been thrown into confusion, as has the CDC’s work on tracking and understanding the bird flu epidemic. I could go on and on listing things, but let’s just say that if you were (for some bizarre reason) deliberately and suddenly trying to ruin biomedical research in the US, &lt;i&gt;you would do it just like this&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;We will come back to those reasons shortly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;2. How Long Has This Been Coming?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;A long time. It may seem like the lightning bolts just started striking, but you can trace these attitudes back many years. Back in 1980 Isaac Asimov had this to say - it’s a fairly famous quote, but it’s worth bringing out again:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot; style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that &#39;my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;And in 1995, Carl Sagan was depressingly on target in “The Demon-Haunted World”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;You’ve probably seen this quote, too:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot; style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;I have a foreboding of an America in my children&#39;s or grandchildren&#39;s time -- when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what&#39;s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Sagan emphasized that members of modern societies are totally dependent on science and technology in ways that they never really think about. Vaccination and clean water are two gigantic public health examples that just seem to be part of the natural order of things. I mean, nobody gets smallpox, and cholera? That shows up in war-torn areas of the Third World, but not even in the dingiest neighborhoods of the poorest cities of the United States. You’d get the idea that we just don’t “do” cholera or yellow fever or polio or diptheria or malaria any more in this country, that we somehow grew up and put all that grubby stuff behind us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;But that’s not how it worked. We put in a lot of research and a lot of money and a lot of effort to control all of those diseases in this country, and the work continues. We can have them all back again, and more, if we just slack off enough, but very few people stop to think about that. Or about many other applications of science outside of public health: anyone who picks up a smart phone and posts to a social media account is using a list of scientific discoveries and applied technologies that would go on for thousands of words here, but how many people realize that? Or realize where discoveries come from at all?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Personally, I can remember seeing a newspaper column in about 1986 from (I believe) the conservative opinion writer Cal Thomas talking about how he would cut the federal budget. He listed program after program he would have axed, and one that part that stood out was “&lt;i&gt;National Science Foundation: academic boondoggle. Eliminate&lt;/i&gt;.” As I recall, he ended the column with a line saying something like “&lt;i&gt;See, the fat is there. All you have to do is look for it.&lt;/i&gt;” I was in grad school at the time, being paid by NSF money, so as you can imagine that caught my attention. That was the first time I’d seen anyone bring up one of these science funding agencies as some sort of total waste, and I found myself wondering just how many people thought this way, and if they’d ever get the chance to put a policy this stupid and destructive into practice. And here we are.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;3. Post-(Huge Things I Care About)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The Techdirt post that I linked above makes a lot of excellent points, and a key one is how what we’re seeing is at least partially a power grab by parts of the tech industry (especially the part centered around Elon Musk). Masnick and his fellow tech journalists are uniquely positioned to see that, but the speed and scope of what’s happening has taken him and others by surprise.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;It may seem surprising that highly educated people who are focused on science and technology would do the things that we’re seeing, but the word “power” is the key. If no one can say what you’re doing is wrong, or harmful, or unnecessary, or too expensive, or too wasteful, or too complex or too vulnerable or too destructive to the environment or anything else. . .well, you can get a lot done very quickly, can’t you? And if you’ve captured all the regulatory agencies and their enforcement powers, and captured the procurement and payment systems along with them, then you can funnel amazing amounts of money to your own businesses while bringing down the big governmental hammer on any would-be competitors. Or on anyone who might cause you any annoyance at all. People are going to have to get on board with your agenda, on your terms, or else. What’s not to like, if you have a titanic ego and loads of inchoate ambition?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;That’s where Musk and Trump meet, in that last sentence. And that’s why we are seeing every possible part of the US government, domestic policy and foreign alike, being turned into patronage schemes, shakedowns, and protection rackets. It’s a horrifying and disgusting sight, but it all hangs together by these common themes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;There are larger (and if possible, even uglier) themes behind them. I mentioned the anti-intellectual strain in the US earlier, but what we’re seeing now is what you might call &lt;i&gt;post&lt;/i&gt;-intellectual. I truly don’t think that Elon Musk is the least bit interested in any sort of scientific discovery that he doesn’t have the financial and property rights to, for example. He’s famously weak on the very engineering and scientific topics that many members of the general public think he’s some sort of genius about, although he’s had plenty of time to brush up on these things by now. But he doesn’t care. He goes just far enough to talk a big game to people who know even less than he does, and no further.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Trump is of course even worse. He is almost supernaturally ignorant, and year after year appears to learn nothing whatsoever. I would not be surprised to find that he is almost functionally illiterate by now - why would he read anything that some flunky couldn’t read for him? He can’t talk about the weather without sounding like he’s had a brain injury, and needless to say whenever anything remotely scientific comes up he garbles it completely. To be fair, many politicians are in roughly similar shape when it comes to science, but this one’s trying to take over the country. Trump is post-intellectual all the way: knowledge doesn’t matter. If nothing were ever discovered again about medicine, physics, chemistry, you name it, it would not disturb his consciousness for a moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;So what about the people who have devoted their lives to these things? Well, they&#39;re suckers. Losers. Almost as bad as the fools who keep bleating about the “rule of law” and the Constitution. Our Vice President, J. D. Vance, has given speeches where he explicitly states that “universities are the enemy”, and what more do you need? They breed attitudes that make things harder for the J. D. Vances of the world. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/note-robert-f-kennedy-jr&quot;&gt;wrote here&lt;/a&gt; about how Robert F. Kennedy is actually hostile to science, and he fits right in with the rest of these people.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;So forget science, forget knowledge. No, what matters is money and power. Especially the second, because getting power is why you accumulate the money in the first place. Famous quotation time again, this time from O’Brien in Orwell’s “1984”:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot; style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;He also had this to say, after asking Winston Smith how one man exerts power over another:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot; style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;You might be reminded of the various “anti-DEI” orders that have come down. Attacks on transsexuals are followed by attacks on women and on minorities of all kinds, and they won’t stop there. You might also be reminded of what Elon Musk himself said to Joe Rogan just the other day, that &quot;&lt;em&gt;empathy is a fundamental weakness of Western civilization&lt;/em&gt;”. If you believe that, then you will be just fine with the world that these people want to make. But I don’t. And I will fight to keep that world from coming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;All this of course means that Trumpism is post-democracy as well. That’s also been coming on for a long time - go read Curtis Yarvin, if you can take it, or you can see his ideas reflected in the writings of Peter Thiel, if you can take those. These people and their acolytes have been saying for many years that checks and balances and democratic institutions are fundamentally unsound and unserious. Some sort of enlightened monarchy or oligarchy, they maintain, would be &lt;i&gt;so, so much better,&lt;/i&gt; and you can guess who gets to be on the inside of it if that happens.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;So when the administration starts trying to take back money that Congress has already appropriated, in direct defiance of the Constitution, that’s no accident. When they tell immigration judges that all the protections from them being fired are being abolished, that’s a direct sign, too. When they start talking about how no federal judicial orders can possibly contradict the decisions of the mighty executive, they really mean it. And when Trump muses about running for another term, believe him, and when a bootlicker like Senator Lindsey Graham signs off on one of his syncophantic rants on social media by saying “Trump 2028”, like he did last night, you can believe him, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;What you shouldn&#39;t believe are their stated reasons for it. As Masnick points out, Elon Musk&#39;s statements about why he bought Twitter and how he would run it turned out to be almost the exact opposite of the truth. In the same way, all this talk of cutting wasteful spending and ending fraud and abuse in the government is total bullshit. You don&#39;t rip up the IRS if you&#39;re worried about the government&#39;s finances. No, t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;he Republican party has been completely captured by people who have decided that Trump is the source of power, and that power is the absolute best thing in the world. They will willingly, cheerfully sell out every principle behind this country’s laws to hang on to it - all the while telling us that they are True Patriots and Originalists and Real Americans and that they’re fighting the evil subversives who dare to say otherwise. The attack on science in this country is just the opening salvo of a barrage that could take everything we love about America down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;But like all bullies, these people will take what powers we let them take. They will steal from us what we allow them to steal. Don’t give up. Don’t give in. Make your voice heard in public and to every elected official whose office you vote for. Donate to the organizations who are fighting this in court, donate to candidates who will replace the craven officials that we have too many of now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;I&#39;m going to continue to post about science here. As I&#39;ve said, I need it to retain my own equilibrium. But what you&#39;re seeing above is what&#39;s at the top of my mind a lot of the time. I&#39;ve written this post so I don&#39;t have to keep writing it again, which should help some. Politics, though, will continue to intrude - to steal a line from Trotsky, you many not be interested in it, but it&#39;s interested in you. . .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/continuing-crisis-part-vii-overview</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/continuing-crisis-part-vii-overview</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 12:22:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Continuing Crisis, Part VI: Rare Diseases at the FDA and More</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part of a series of posts on the attack on Federally funded research and development - Part V is&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/continuing-crisis-part-v-what-nih-telling-its-people&quot;&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Biocentury &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biocentury.com/article/655243/turmoil-at-fda-puts-rare-disease-review-capacity-at-risk&quot;&gt;has an example&lt;/a&gt; - and there are many - of what the insane turmoil inside the US government is doing to agencies like the FDA. Speaking with a source who&#39;s a reviewer for orphan drugs, they note that there is an ongoing exodus of the staff who handle rare disease approvals, which is the sort of specialized area where the harm will become apparent most quickly.&amp;nbsp;That&#39;s going to be trouble for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.labiotech.eu/best-biotech/rare-disease-day-drugs-awaiting-approval-2025/&quot;&gt;whole list&lt;/a&gt; of orphan indications that were scheduled for review this year. You can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://checkrare.com/2025-orphan-drugs-pdufa-dates-and-fda-approvals/&quot;&gt;from this list&lt;/a&gt; that things that were already in the works before the inauguration have been approved, but you wonder what&#39;s going to go on with &lt;a href=&quot;https://checkrare.com/2025-orphan-drugs-pdufa-dates-and-fda-approvals/&quot;&gt;fitusiran&lt;/a&gt; for hemophilia B, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamipretide&quot;&gt;elamipritide&lt;/a&gt; for Barth syndrome, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2409368&quot;&gt;plozasiran&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;span&gt;chylomicronemia, and more. Let&#39;s watch the dates on these drugs and try to get a read on how bad the situation is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it&#39;s a problem across the agency; the orphan drug approvals are just the early warning signs:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reviewer’s descriptions of plunging morale and plans to leave FDA are consistent with reports from other parts of FDA. Six weeks of arbitrary firings, restrictions on external communication, and politicized denigration of civil servants have demoralized the agency. And there is a feeling among career employees that things are about to get worse. . .BioCentury’s conversations with agency employees at all levels over the last week paint a picture of an agency in crisis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sure that&#39;s accurate. How could it not be? And that holds for so many other agencies as well (NSF, the NIH, NOAA, the USDA and more). The science-based agencies themselves have turned out to be just the early warning signs of what&#39;s happening all over the government. It&#39;s interesting (in a grim way) that these were so high on the list - you can easily make sense of the other agencies that are coming under attack, since they tend to be those that either Elon Musk has personal hatred for (USAID) or those that inconvenience him and other billionaire businessmen (the EPA, OSHA, the IRS, financial regulators in general, and so on). It&#39;s certainly a testimony to the priorities of the Trump administration that they started gutting R&amp;amp;D so quickly and vigorously. And you can imagine what I think about those priorities.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One ray of light has been that the NSF has been able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/article/nsf-brings-back-84-fired-workers-after-judge-blocks-white-house-ordered-dismissals&quot;&gt;start re-hiring&lt;/a&gt; the probationary employees that it recently (and suddenly) fired. A federal judge (William Alsup) &lt;a href=&quot;https://federalnewsnetwork.com/workforce/2025/02/federal-judge-invalidates-opms-directives-to-terminate-federal-probationary-workers/&quot;&gt;ruled that&lt;/a&gt; the OPM could not legally issue such orders, saying that &quot;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;OPM does not have any authority whatsoever, under any statute in the history of the universe to hire and fire employees within another agency&lt;/em&gt;. . .&quot; Let&#39;s hope this leads to more such reinstatements. There are many other firings that this ruling will not touch, but there are many court cases underway as well. I am very glad to see this ruling, and very glad to see the push back. We&#39;re still heading towards some very nasty territory when the Trump administration runs straight into court rulings that it will want to violate immediately, but we&#39;ll cross that bridge when we come to it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fight on! The alternative is to sit back and watch this country ruined. That would have sounded like an extreme statement just a few weeks ago, and I would have had emails and comments telling me to calm down, things aren&#39;t so bad. But you know what? Things really &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; that bad, and unless we use everything we can think of to fight back they&#39;re going to get much, much worse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/rare-diseases-fda-here-it-comes</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/rare-diseases-fda-here-it-comes</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 11:45:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Progress on RNA-Based Cancer Vaccines</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been writing about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/rna-vaccines-cancer&quot;&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/vaccine-pancreatic-cancer-treatment&quot;&gt;couple of years&lt;/a&gt; now, so I wanted to follow up with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08508-4&quot;&gt;latest news&lt;/a&gt;. A team at Sloan-Kettering, BioNTech, and others has been trying to make the long-sought &quot;cancer vaccine&quot; idea a reality, and if anyone thinks that this is a new idea or a sudden overnight success, think again. Immuno-oncology has been trying to get off the ground for decades now, and a lot of &quot;let&#39;s attack cancer with the body&#39;s own defenses&quot; ideas have already failed. It&#39;s not like it isn&#39;t an appealing idea, but it&#39;s also not like people thought it would be simple, either, because cancer is famously a disease where the body is ravaged by malignant out-of-control cells that largely breeze right past the immune system defenses. After all, they&#39;re carrying all the cellular markers that say &quot;I&#39;m just one of you guys, nothing to see here&quot;. Any cancer cells that succeed in growing will have been able to deploy all sorts of diversionary tactics, which means that a successful immuno-oncology treatment is (in the end) saying &quot;No, no, over here. &lt;em&gt;These&lt;/em&gt; cells. Can you see them &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The work I&#39;m referring to is all about finding &quot;neoantigens&quot;, cell-surface proteins that are found only on such tumor cells, and priming the body to attack them. The cancer they&#39;re treating is PDAC, pancreatic ductal adrenocarcinoma, which is by far the major subtype of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer&quot;&gt;pancreatic cancer&lt;/a&gt; in general. It has a famously poor prognosis - the only real cure is surgery, and there are very few cases which are caught early enough (and with the tumor tissue in the right places) for that to be a good option. For this therapy, the team produced individual RNA vaccines for each patient in the study, targeting up to 20 neoantigen proteins based on each patient&#39;s tumor cells. These were based on &quot;passenger mutations&quot; that aren&#39;t driving the cancer growth themselves, but occur along the way - PDAC tumors actually tend to have an overall low mutation rate, with mutations in the &lt;em&gt;KRAS&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CDKN2A&lt;/em&gt; genes almost always driving things. The overall low rate of other mutations is a feature here, providing a chance that a vaccine response might be able to cover the whole range of cells found in the actual tumor tissue. (You&#39;d have a much harder time going after something like the highly genetically unstable glioblastomas).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But it&#39;s just the neoantigens that the immune system doesn&#39;t seem to be able to mount an effective response to normally, and thus the need for a kick-start via vaccination. The patients each get their own personal vaccine, along with an anti-PD-L1 antibody and some standard chemotherapy. The second link in the post covers the team&#39;s 2023 report, which showed that 8 out of the 16 patients had a strong response, which is a truly remarkable result. This new paper follows up on these same patients after (now at double the time after the original treatment) to see if their immune system memory is still holding up.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that it certainly seems to be! Vaccine-induced T cells from these patients are still present after this time, while the other 8 patients who had recurrance did not show such a response even at the start. 86% of the different T-cell clones (on average) that were present at first are still circulating three years after the therapy, and the team estimates that up to 20% of these may have multi-decade lifespans in the body. Of the eight initial responders, though, two of them have had recurrance of PDAC - but tissue samples from these tumors (as compared to their original tumors) show that these are displaying neoantigens that were not in the original cells. That is, the vaccine T-cell reponse seems to have &quot;pruned&quot; these cancer types entirely.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So the immunological case looks very solid here, but there are some things to note. These 16 patients were carefully selected, with resectable local disease at the very start. &lt;a href=&quot;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1895234724940955875.html&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s an analysis&lt;/a&gt; that is more pessimistic than I am, but it needs to be taken into account. From what I&#39;m seeing, when the vaccine response does occur, it keeps people alive who otherwise would absolutely have died by now. And the duration of that response is correlated with remaining cancer-free: on a cell-by-cell basis, the tumor cells displaying the neoantigens targeted by the original vaccine seem to be wiped out. This is great progress, and it shows exactly what needs to be worked on now: getting a broader response from the original vaccinations, and finding ways to widen the number of neotantigens to catch those recurrances. There&#39;s a much &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05968326&quot;&gt;larger trial underway&lt;/a&gt; that&#39;s trying to enroll up to 260 patients. This will provide more key information and also help to refine the whole process of making the individualized neoantigen vaccines (which isn&#39;t easy, as you&#39;d guess).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The neoantigen vaccine idea &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-022-01270-x&quot;&gt;isn&#39;t limited&lt;/a&gt; to pancreatic cancer, of course. This is a great proving ground (with the low overall mutation rates, as mentioned), but there are other tumor types that should be within range. And as we discover more in the clinical work about how these things behave under real-world vaccination conditions, there&#39;s no telling what might be accomplished. Congratuations to everyone involved - this is the culmination (so far!) of a huge amount of work that is finally starting to pay off.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/progress-rna-based-cancer-vaccines</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/progress-rna-based-cancer-vaccines</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 07:24:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Thiazide Target, At Last</title><description>&lt;p&gt;There are still a surprising number of drugs in the &quot;Well, they work but we don&#39;t quite understand how&quot; category. Next to that one is the &quot;Well, we know one way that they work but they&#39;re clearly doing other things that we don&#39;t understand&quot; category, which is even larger! It looks like one of these has finally been cracked, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiazide&quot;&gt;thiazide diuretics&lt;/a&gt; used for treating high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These were discovered back in the 1950s, and you can read the personal account of one of those folks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.HYP.22.3.388&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, in an article from the early 1990s. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.invent.org/inductees/karl-beyer-jr&quot;&gt;Karl Beyer&lt;/a&gt; went way back; he began research at Sharp and Dohme and stayed with the company when they merged with Merck! And here&#39;s how it went in those days:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;My associates of more than 30 years may recall my rumination about how to work &quot;beyond the limits ofknowledge,&quot; which is quite different from working in the lab with clinical correlates, as mentioned previously. Our approach to working beyond the limits of knowledge was so simple I coined another term to make it more acceptable. I set up a large laboratory with several well-trained and discerning technicians who did assays of specific pharmacological effects. Many compounds were subjected to these assays, sometimes for no better reason than that a chemist thought the results on his compounds might be interesting. Sometimes we got compounds made for us, the biologists, for no better reason. I called that lab our &quot;Pharmacometric Unit.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve always felt that you need a bit of this no matter where you work, but at the same time, running an entire research effort that way must have been a bit hard on the nerves. The thiazides came out of structure-activity work starting from sulfonamide-based carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, but it was quickly apparent that their effects were not driven by that mechanism. Some drug discovery truths are eternal:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . .what had started out before the merger as Sharp &amp;amp; Dohme research was now a Merck Sharp &amp;amp; Dohme project. At the time, I was young and bold and &quot;didn&#39;t need consultants.&quot; Merck research was more mature and had the best of consultants who had no confidence that salt played an important role in essential hypertension. A diuretic was a diuretic. . .What was important was that we do the right things right and in the right sequence with respect to preclinical and early clinical assessment of the compound. For instance, a serious hazard was whether we should check out the antihypertensive effect of these thiazides in hypertensive rats before taking chlorothiazide to theclinic. We had some previous experience with hyperten-sive rats. I made it clear that nobody was to put one of these compounds in a hypertensive animal, at least not until it had been given to hypertensive human beings. . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;That turned out to be a wise move, by the way - many rat models (although not all) are resistant to thiazides. I take one of these drugs myself (hydrochlorothiazide) and I was nonplussed when I looked it up and found that it was in the &quot;must be doing something else too&quot; category. But I shouldn&#39;t have been - even back in the 1950s it was recognized that other things were going on:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back when whether lowering hypertensive blood pressure was good for you was as subject to debate as to discussion, it hardly seemed worth considering how a drug could be both diuretic and antihypertensive; that is, unless it was conceivable that the appropriate cells of organs having different primary functions (kidneys and arterial vessels) might relate similarly to modulation oftheir sodium balance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that you don&#39;t have to assume that! A target for these drugs in the kidney is known, a sodium/chloride &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-chloride_symporter&quot;&gt;transporter protein&lt;/a&gt;, and the thiazides inhibit reabsorption of both sodium and chloride ions (and increase reabsorption of calcium through what&#39;s likely to be more than one mechanism. There&#39;s some of your immediate diuretic effect, but extending that transporter mechanism to explain lowering hypertension has never really made sense. So it&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2019.00815/full&quot;&gt;long been thought&lt;/a&gt; that there must be a direct vascular target for these drugs as well that helps account for their robust blood-pressure-lowering effects, and that&#39;s what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell-chemical-biology/fulltext/S2451-9456(25)00031-5?rss=yes&quot;&gt;this new paper&lt;/a&gt; seems to have found.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s &lt;span&gt;N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D, NAPE-PLD, a membrane-associate protein in the endocannabinoid system whose dimeric structure is stabilized by the binding of hydrochlorothiazide. The authors present an X-ray structure showing the hydrochlorothiazide sitting right in the interface between the two monomeric proteins. The binding constant for HCZ is about 8 micromolar, but thermal shift shows a strong stabilization, although this doesn&#39;t alter the catalyic efficiency of the phospholipase itself. Its binding strengthens the existing allosteric site interaction of bile acid molecules in the dimer structure - indeed, in the presence of such compounds the binding of HCZ improves by an order of magnitude and shows a notably slower off-rate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The paper goes on to show evidence for a membrane-pore-opening mechanism that&#39;s modulated by the protein&#39;s dimeric state, and they propose that PLP (pyridoxal 5′- phosphate) associates with the protein and is transported into cells by this mechanism. Interestingly, they take an entirely synthetic molecule that binds into the same site as HCZ and show that it, too, has blood-pressure lowering effects! Taken together, this would seem to point the way to an entirely new mechanism for blood pressure lowering, to a new sort of transport protein phenomenon, and to provided a real solution to the thiazide vascular mystery. Not bad at all!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/thiazide-target-last</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/thiazide-target-last</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 11:05:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Neurodegeneration Might Come Down to RNA</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegeneration is a topic that we simultaneously know a lot and a little about. In some of these conditions (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/huntington-s-disease-cell-cell&quot;&gt;Huntington&#39;s&lt;/a&gt;) we have strong evidence of the fundamental abnormalities at the genetic and protein level, while in others (like Alzheimer&#39;s) the arguing continues at a high pitch. But in all of them we have problems tracing exactly what&#39;s going wrong, and in what order. Working with brain tissue in advanced cases of such degenerative diseases is like coming suddenly upon the scene of a huge natural or man-made disaster - there&#39;s damage everywhere (from shock waves, from fires, from flooding) and it&#39;s hard to know where to start. Did an earthquake cause a chemical plant to explode? Or did the plant blow up with such force that its damage resembles an earthquake? Did the explosion start a huge fire, or did a small fire break out first that then got out of control?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that on the macro scale we have techniques to start sorting these things out, but inside living cells the situation is much more tangled. &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/105446&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt;, though, has a very interesting hypothesis that we can hope will provide some clarity. The authors are focusing on RNA &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-quadruplex&quot;&gt;G-quadruplexes&lt;/a&gt;, structures that can form in guanine-rich nucleic acids. These (in both their DNA and RNA forms) have &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/49/10/5426/6194432&quot;&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/49/10/5426/6194432&quot;&gt;subject&lt;/a&gt; of a huge amount of research over the years, with more of that devoted to the DNA end of things. But it&#39;s recently become clear that RNA species have plenty of these in them, too, and the question is always how much of these structures are normal (and have various normal functions) and at what level would you call their levels abnormal (and what happens then?)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What this team shows is that the amount of RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) in hippocampal tissue increases as a function of age, and what&#39;s more, it increases as a function of the severity of diagnosed Alzheimer&#39;s at the time of death. The pattern is particularly apparent in the outer molecular layer (OML) of that tissue. That fits in with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-35811-x&quot;&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; work &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.178&quot;&gt;suggesting&lt;/a&gt; that such quadruplexes are a sign of cellular stress in general. And it also fits in with other recent work that shows that such structures can induce protein aggregation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.01.582861&quot;&gt;particularly&lt;/a&gt; tau (which is already the subject of decades of work due to its abnormalities in Alzheimer&#39;s brain tissue). Not only that, but the rG4 staining is also strongly influenced by the APOE4 status of the individuals (that lipoprotein gene is one of the few general-population-level markers for Alzheimer&#39;s risk). This is the first paper to tie these rG4 ideas together into Alzheimer&#39;s tissue studies, and it looks like it has borne fruit.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On the cellular level, the trouble seems to be found in punctae in the cytoplasm of &lt;span&gt;neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes (but not really microglia)&lt;/span&gt;, down near the nucleus, but not inside it. And it seems to have a strong correlation with tau staining as well. This makes you wonder if various stresses gradually accumulate more RNA G-quadruplexes in the cell, which in their turn start to aggregate tau (and perhaps other proteins), which then just brings on yet more cellular stress. What&#39;s uncertain are things like the exact stressors that lead to rG4 accumulation and the role of the ensuing disruptions in normal RNA trafficking. There&#39;s a lot to be done here, but this could be a useful framework to start getting things into the right order (and in looking at the right places). And that work could lead us to some more useful places to intervene in Alzheimer&#39;s drug discovery, and man, could we ever use some of those compared to what we have now!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/neurodegeneration-might-come-down-rna</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/neurodegeneration-might-come-down-rna</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 12:45:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Paxlovid: You&#39;d Have Expected More</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2830683&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s a new paper&lt;/a&gt; addressing something many of have wondered about. The clinical trials of Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) showed reduced hospitalization and severe coronavirus among the unvaccinated patients studies, but the effect was not significant among vaccinated ones. But in those trials the median ages of the participants were in their 40s, and it&#39;s also been very clear that risks for severe disease increase with age. So what is Paxlovid&#39;s effect in older populations, and how does that correlate with vaccination status? This is of more than casual personal interest, since I&#39;m in my early 60s and have taken the drug after coronavirus infection. I realized at the time that I was doing so on incomplete data, but reasoned that there were reasonable odds of it providing some benefit to someone in my situation (having also had some lung damage after a bout of double pneumonia a few years ago). And at the same time I felt that a week of a viral protease inhibitor plus ritonavir would not do me much harm.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The authors are taking advantage of a &quot;natural experiment&quot; situation in Ontario. Between April and December of 2022, the province reserved Paxlovid treatment for symptomatic adults aged 70 or older, with exceptions for the immunocompromised or were incompletely vaccinated along with at least one other risk factor. The authors examined data for ther 65-69 year old cohort along with the 70-74 year olds across this discontinuity, looking for effects. There were 1.6 million Ontario residents aged 65-74, and nearly 88% had received at least two coronavirus vaccine doses. There were almost 20,000 prescriptions for Paxlovid, and&amp;nbsp; nearly twice as many of them in the 70-and-older group.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But there were no significant differences in the below-70 cohort versus the above-70 one in Covid-related hospitalizations, all-cause hospitalizations, or all-cause mortality. And looking back to 2021, before Paxlovid became available at all, there were no significant differences between those groups then, either. So from these data (which are surely among the best we have) it appears that in vaccinated adults (without reference to any high-risk subgroups) that Paxlovid is not making much of a difference at all! That&#39;s even if you make the most optimistic assumptions within the study&#39;s statistical confidence intervals. The first trial of the drug (which was in unvaccinated adults) showed an absolute risk reduction for hospitalization of 5.5%, but the best that these data could possibly stretch to is a 1.3% improvement in this older and mostly-vaccinated group. And it&#39;s more likely that there was no real difference at all.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The other way to interpret this is that the vaccinations themselves have done enough to help keep people out of the hospital that Paxlovid treatment can&#39;t do much more. I think it&#39;s very likely that if there had been a Paxlovid trial early on with a median age of 70 among unvaccinated adults (instead of the real median age of 42) that it would have shown much more than that 5.5% improvement in hospitalization risk! But vaccinating these patients makes any benefit of Paxlovid drop back into the statistical noise. So to me, these data are disappointing for Paxlovid, but likely reinforce the benefits of the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If I get another round of the coronavirus, then, will I take Paxlovid? Good question! I have seen no evidence that a course of the drug does any harm, but if a drug&#39;s not doing you any good then you really shouldn&#39;t take it at all. One thing this study doesn&#39;t address are the risks of long-term side effects of the infection, which I certainly don&#39;t want, either (and haven&#39;t shown any signs of, I have to say). Does Paxlovid treatment lower the risks for these complications or not? I would very much like to see some more data around this question, because after these numbers you do have to wonder. The main studies I&#39;m aware of are &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10037200/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11213188/&quot;&gt;this one.&lt;/a&gt; The first of those did show a reduction in the risk of long-term complications in both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, and their cohort was mostly older white dudes like me. The second one showed a lower risk of long-term complications in high-risk patients, but not in low-risk ones. So there&#39;s some evidence of benefit, which might tip me towards experiencing Paxlovid&#39;s delightful taste alterations again, should I have need. But it&#39;s not as clear a decision as one would have thought. And I&#39;d rather not have to make it at all!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/paxlovid-you-d-have-expected-more</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/paxlovid-you-d-have-expected-more</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 09:33:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Continuing Crisis, Part V: What the NIH Is Telling Its People</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This is part of a series of posts on the attacks on science and federally-funded research in the US. Part IV is&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/continuing-crisis-part-iv&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here is the text of a letter sent to all NIH staff this morning from the acting director, Matthew Memoli. I do not find it as reassuring as I believe he is hoping it to be, but I&#39;ll let people draw their own conclusions:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Colleagues:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;I want to acknowledge the challenges we are facing at NIH during this period of significant change. I joined NIH more than 20 years ago as a clinical fellow and continued as an intramural researcher, driven by a deep belief in public service and the transformative power of biomedical research to advance public health. I know this committment is something we all share. The last few weeks have been difficult for many of us, but we must prepare for further changes ahead. When this transition is behind us, NIH may look different, but out missions - to improve the health of all people through groundbreaking medical research - will remain unchanged. We will continue to pursue that mission diligently and efficiently.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This week, HHS welcomed a new Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. If you missed the event, I encourage you to watch the livestream. Secretary Kennedy spoke warming about NIH, recalling how, as a young boy and aspiring scientist, he visited NIH and admired NIH researchers. He described them as the smartest people in the world - driven not by financial gain, but by a higher calling, a deep-seated idealism. That belief in NIH scientists remains with him today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;We will have many opportunities to demonstrate our value to Secretary Kennedy in the coming weeks and months. NIH stands at the forefront of providing the critical data needed to combat chronic diseases and address the many interconnected factors that influence health, from obesity to nutrition to environmental exposures. As we have for more than 138 years, NIH will rise to the occasion, advancing scientific discoveries that improve lives and reaffirming our essential role in the nation&#39;s health landscape.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What I see in this is some frantically trying to mitigate the onslaught from the new administration by buttering up the new HHS secretary, up to and including all his pet causes as something that the agency can use to &quot;demonstrate our value&quot; to him with. What the hell, I hope it works. But I myself would not trust a single world out of RFK Jr.&#39;s mouth, including the common parts of speech and any opinions about whether it&#39;s raining. Like his boss, the truth does not appear to be in him. He says what he says to get what he wants, and there&#39;s an end to it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/continuing-crisis-part-v-what-nih-telling-its-people</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/continuing-crisis-part-v-what-nih-telling-its-people</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 01:13:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What the Antifungals Are Really Doing</title><description>&lt;p&gt;After that post on bacteria and antibiotics the other day, I thought I might give equal time to the antifungals. It&#39;s really hard to say which of those fields is harder to make headway in! As I&#39;ve mentioned before around here, the continued use of as nasty (and as old) a drug as Amphotericin B really shows how much we need new drugs against fungal infections. I think it&#39;s safe to say, though, that the tools available in that research are not as varied and advanced as the ones used in studying bacteria.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Some of that is just because of how different fungi are from many other creatures (with the presence of chitin in their cell walls, for example, immediately marking them off from almost every other form of life). Those differences can be exploitable, of course, such as the way that many drugs in this area take advantage the fungal use of ergosterol instead of cholesterol. But they also make it tricky to understand what&#39;s going on with them, even though fungal genomes in general are rather small. And to be honest, that part is not really a feature you like in drug discovery, because it means that the number of possible drug targets is also probably limited.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136759312500002X?dgcid=rss_sd_all&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s a recent paper&lt;/a&gt; summarizing some work on antifungal probe molecules, and you can see by reading it that there have been quite a few surprises along the way. In each of these cases, the usual warnings apply: fluorescently modified drugs are not the parent drug, and can have differences in localization, stability, and binding constants. But in each of the cases mentioned below, the authors have taken care to show that the probes do seem to be working through the same mechanism as the parent drugs, which is the first thing you&#39;d want to make sure of.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a large class of azole-based antifungal drugs, which target &lt;span&gt;lanosterol 14α-demethylase (Cyp51), a key enzyme in ergosterol biosynthesis. Making fluorescent derivatives of these showed that some of them actually accumulate in mitochondria, which was unexpected and probably not very helpful in the mechanism of action, since Cyp51 is believed to be in the endoplasmic reticulum. The authors have prepared &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacsau.4c00479&quot;&gt;new analogs&lt;/a&gt; that do a better job of localizing to the ER, but have noted that in different fungal species that localization can show some unexpected shifts, even among different species in the same genus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They&#39;ve also made intracellular probes out of a newer class of antifungals, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinocandin&quot;&gt;echinocandins&lt;/a&gt;, which inhibit the production of beta-glucan in the fungal cell wall. Having a different mechanism than an ergosterol-based one is valueable for sure, but it has to be said that these drugs are only outright fungicidal in some cases. They&#39;re often given as part of a cocktail with the azole drugs or even with Amphotericin B (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/cc/d0cc08177a&quot;&gt;which itself&lt;/a&gt; has had some probes made and studied). The fluorescent probes from several different echinocandins showed &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.0c00813&quot;&gt;widely varied&lt;/a&gt; cellular uptake, which (since the fluorescent group isn&#39;t changing) is likely due to the parent drug parts of their structures. Unexpectedly, some of them slip right into cellular vacuoles via endocytosis, while others are mostly stuck to the outside surface.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the team has also made fluorescent versions of the aminoglycosides &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobramycin&quot;&gt;tobramycin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neamine&quot;&gt;neamine&lt;/a&gt;, which are perhaps better known as antibacterials. They have such wide-ranging activity because they are believed to work by disrupting plasma membranes in general (and as you&#39;d figure can come with some significant toxicity of their own because of that). Surprisingly, these didn&#39;t just pile up on the outer membranes of yeast cells, but were distributed throughout the cytoplasm, and they seemed to be causing damage to DNA and organelles along the way. It&#39;s quite possible that the membrane-disrupting actions are at work inside the cells as well, then.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There&#39;s obviously a lot to learn about these agents, and it&#39;s a good time to be learning it, too, because resistance to the existing antifungals is increasing around the world. Bacteria get more attention, but we don&#39;t want these things sneaking up on us, either!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/what-antifungals-are-really-doing</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/what-antifungals-are-really-doing</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 01:09:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Pharma CEOS Speaking Up, Damn It</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I honestly planned to write about something else today. But as I seem to be saying a lot these days, here we are. . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/stand-and-be-counted&quot;&gt;wrote here a week ago&lt;/a&gt; about the near-total silence from biopharma CEOs about what has been happening under the current administration, and called on people to speak up. We&#39;re starting to see some of that, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/19/nih-research-funding-cuts-indirect-costs-sbir-recursion/&quot;&gt;this editorial&lt;/a&gt; by the CEO of Recursion Pharma. Chris Gibson says (correctly) that basic research funded by government grants has built the foundation for a lot of the biopharma industry, and that we should thus all be worried about the attempts to slash it into pieces (and, as he says, to advance private funds to try to lessen some of the damage).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But there are other voices speaking out, and honestly I think some of them were better off staying quiet. Consider Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla&#39;s remarks on Tuesday at the PhRMA Forum in Washington, &lt;a href=&quot;https://endpts.com/pfizer-ceo-says-trump-opportunities-outweigh-risks/&quot;&gt;as reported here&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Endpoints&lt;/em&gt;. Echoing some remarks &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/sarahlazare.bsky.social/post/3lhgszrggtc2f&quot;&gt;made earlier&lt;/a&gt; on a Pfizer earnings call, Bourla told the assembled executives that:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I truly believe the opportunities clearly outweigh the risks, because this is an administration, to start with, that they believe that strong business, strong private sector, strong entrepreneurship makes America great. . .That was not the case with the previous administration.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Well, that&#39;s the stuff to give them in the Trump administration, for sure. Lots of tough and manly stuff about strong leadership and making America great, that&#39;ll fetch &#39;em for sure. The current head of PhRMA, Stephen Ubl, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-19/pharma-leaders-to-meet-trump-in-push-to-tweak-drug-policies?leadSource=uverify%20wall&quot;&gt;appeared at the meeting&lt;/a&gt; this way:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The prospects for bold, meaningful change have never been greater,” Ubl said at the event, standing in front of a video screen displaying a rippling American flag. “We have a disruptor-in-chief in President Trump and a bold new health secretary, both committed to breaking the status quo.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Bourla, who is described by Bloomberg reporters as having become &quot;&lt;em&gt;the industry’s loudest voice on the subject of the new administration&lt;/em&gt;&quot; also said that&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Do I think that we can convince them to do something bold in vaccines with Kennedy in HHS? Probably not,” Bourla said Tuesday. “But do I think that we can convince them to do something very bold for cancer or cardiovascular diseases with Kennedy in the HHS? Absolutely yes.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I have a response to talk like this: &lt;strong&gt;goddamn it, you fools&lt;/strong&gt;. I do not expect a high executive from any industry to speak from his or her heart, but I what I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; like is for some other organs to participate, starting with the head. It is transparently obvious what such people are playing at. They do indeed see opportunities with the new administration, which is mostly led by people who only have a faint idea of what they are doing when it comes to biopharma regulation and health care. The likes of Bourla and Ubl see a chance for regulations to be tossed aside and larger profits than ever to be made, just so long as the new administration believes that these actions look Tough and Decisive and are somehow Making America Great Again. They are determined to make the best of the situation, and talking about boldly breaking the status quo and all that horseshit looks like the most direct way to do it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow Bourla and a number of other biopharma execs are meeting with Trump directly, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s going to be a nauseating spectacle. As we see in all of the President&#39;s appearances, he wants to be flattered outlandishly and as publicly as possible - remember those &quot;cabinet meetings&quot; he had in his first term where almost everyone led off by rhapsodizing about what an almost unbearable privilege it was to serve under a President so mighty and powerful? I would expect plenty of that sort of thing all through the meeting, and thank God I&#39;m not a big pharma executive, because I&#39;d rather eat glass than do it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So fine, this kind of thing disgusts me. But what am I calling those who engage in it fools? Because &lt;em&gt;it doesn&#39;t work that well&lt;/em&gt;. I&#39;m sure that Bourla and many of his fellow CEOs feel very worldly and seasoned when they survey the current environment and talk about new business opportunities. But I&#39;m enough of a man of the world myself (and enough of a student of history) to have seen many examples of people who hoped to get ahead by flattering vengeful authoritarians only to have it blow up on them. Sure, those bold new spirits you&#39;re shining the shoes of&amp;nbsp;might decide to grease a whole list of quick drug approvals for you as long as they get some of the credit in the press, and who knows, the administration might gut the department at Medicare who were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/first-round-medicare-price-reductions&quot;&gt;going to negotiate&lt;/a&gt; the next round of lower prices under the Inflation Reduction Act while they&#39;re firing everyone in sight. But then again, they might slap big hefty charges on anyone doing business with Chinese CROs (America First!) or decide that what would make them really popular are some nice public chest-beating price restrictions as they Take On Big Pharma or something. Can you rule things like that out? Of course you can&#39;t - you can&#39;t rule anything out with these people if they think it might benefit them. I know, I know, you&#39;re thinking that way too and you&#39;re always going to be a couple of steps ahead, right? Sure.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s get back to the cursing. One thing that seems never to have been brought up in public at the PhRMA meeting is the current slash-and-burn treatment of the NIH, NSF, and apparently all the other research-funding federal agencies (NOAA, USDA, NASA, and more). Not one word, from what I can see, even though this unprecedented attack is going on right now just a few blocks from where these biopharma titans are meeting. This is the Trump administration showing its true face, by its actions. They are hostile to science, hostile to scientists, and hostile to research funding. And they simply do not care how many peoples&#39; lives and work are ruined as they go on the attack, cutting into these agencies with all the care and forethought of a three-year-old left alone with a reciprocating saw. &lt;em&gt;These&lt;/em&gt; are the people you&#39;re cozying up to? And the basic researchers who are getting shafted along with the next generation of US scientists, &lt;em&gt;including your future hires I might add&lt;/em&gt;, those are the people that you don&#39;t see fit to mention? That&#39;s nearly obscene. For God&#39;s sake, I liked it better when you all were just staying quiet.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/pharma-ceos-speaking-damn-it</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/pharma-ceos-speaking-damn-it</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 02:10:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>So Why Don&#39;t Antibiotics Always Work?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to say how many human lives have been saved by antibiotics, and there are still a few people alive who lived through the introduction of things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin&quot;&gt;penicillin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfanilamide&quot;&gt;sulfanilamide&lt;/a&gt;. The dramatic change in the treatment of bacterial infection during that era really can&#39;t be overstated. Doctors knew exactly what a terminal infection looked like, because they saw such things frequently, and they knew that there was nothing they could really do about it. Until the advent of antibiotic therapy, when suddenly people that were as good as dead recovered, shook off their fevers, and asked when lunch was coming. That&#39;s literally what happened: in 1942, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/09/us/anne-miller-90-first-patient-who-was-saved-by-penicillin.html&quot;&gt;Anne Miller&lt;/a&gt; had been hospitalized for a month in New Haven with a terrible streptococcal infection. It just got worse and worse, and after a week of temperatures up to 107 F (nearly 42 C!) despite all treatments, including sulfanilamide itself, she was near death and injected with experimental penicillin. Her hospital chart is now in the Smithsonian; she lived until 1999.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But bacteria don&#39;t take such things calmly. They are constantly growing and constantly throwing off mutations, and some of these allow them to escape the actions of one or another antibiotic. And under that selection pressure, those are the ones that survive. We now live in a world where the early antibiotics are in many cases useless, because the odds are that the infection you&#39;re trying to treat is full of resistant bacterial strains. This has been recognized for many decades, as has the overall slowing of discovery in the search for completely new antibiotics with resistance-evading modes of action. I&#39;ve done some of that research myself, and I can testify from personal experience that it can be one hell of an impermeable rock face to make progress on. I&#39;ve killed plenty of mammalian cells in culture over the years (did some in last week, as a matter of fact) but I was barely able to ruffle the cilia of real pathogenic bacteria.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s still a lot we don&#39;t know about how resistant bacteria work in the real world, though. One widely-held theory is that any given infection can have a small population of &quot;persisters&quot; that survive the antibiotic treatment and come back to cause trouble. There&#39;s also evidence that stress in the tissue being infected can interfere with antibiotic action in general. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08506-6&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; from a group at U. Basel has some very interesting things to say about those ideas, though.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The authors did a direct comparison of antibiotic action against &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; bacteria in mice and in culture (agar plates). These experiments included fluorescent reporter proteins that could provide a real-time readout of antibiotic action inside the bacterial (DNA damage, etc.) Overall, &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; is not what you want if you&#39;re a mouse (or if you&#39;re a human, although there are certainly worse out there). Antibiotics in general were not very effective in that animal/bacteria combination, which was already known. At first glance, the plate results seem to fit with the &quot;persister&quot; idea, in that one of the only agents that worked (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrofloxacin&quot;&gt;enrofloxacin&lt;/a&gt;) showed a large number of bacteria were cleared rather quickly, leaving about 5% behind that seemed untouchable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But this seems to have been an artifact of nutrient starvation in the plate experiments (done to mimic tissue-stress conditions). When more food was provided and these apparent persisters started growing again, they were killed by residual antibiotic. In fact, the nutrient stress seems to have been the main factor at work, making antibiotic action against the entire infective population rather slow, and contributing to the impression that persistant bacteria are avoiding their effects. But the way they&#39;re &quot;avoiding&quot; the antibiotic is not because they&#39;re especially resistant, but through not being able to grow due to nutrient supplies. Single-cell experiments confirmed this theory: the &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; as a whole were tough to kill under these conditions, and it was the agar-plate assay that make it look like there was a remnant resistant population.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So the authors conclude that we shouldn&#39;t assume the existence of such populations, especially based on agar-plate assays (which unfortunately have been the standard in many cases). And we should also take into account the nutrient-starvation effect on the efficacy of antibiotics in general: if they&#39;re not growing, they&#39;re not exposing the mechanisms that antibiotics are using to kill them. Real-time single cell assays are a lot more work, but they may be the best (or even only) way to be sure about what you&#39;re looking at.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/so-why-don-t-antibiotics-always-work</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/so-why-don-t-antibiotics-always-work</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 10:56:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Continuing Crisis, Part IV</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This is part of a series of posts on the attacks on science and federally-funded research in the US. Part III is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/continuing-nih-nsf-crisis-part-iii-indirect&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As many will have heard, the last few days have seen even more turmoil in the NIH and other federally funded science agencies. No one should have any doubt by this point: this is an unprecedented situation. There&#39;s no &quot;Well, what was the result last time this happened&quot;, because there has never been anything to compare to this sustained assault. The stated reasons are things like efficiency, rooting out fraud, and ridding the government of diversity initiatives and &quot;wokeness&quot;, but the size of these cuts and the ways that they&#39;re being done argue for darker motivations (revenge, hostility to expertise, and a deep, persistant incomprehension of how scientific research works and what it provides).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; has started a &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/article/science-trump-latest-news&quot;&gt;Trump Tracker&lt;/a&gt;&quot; to keep up with all this, and sadly I think that&#39;s a necessary step. Because of it, I will not be trying to summarize all the latest news here at this point. But what&#39;s happened in the last few days has been notable for the widespread firing of people who were in the &quot;probationary&quot; period of employment. This needs some detail, because in most places that means new hires. That&#39;s true for the government, too, but it &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; means people who have recently been promoted or who have moved to another part of the organization. Why fire them? Because they can be fired much more easily; they are relatively unprotected compared to people who have been in their same position past that probationary period. It&#39;s certainly true that I don&#39;t think that anyone has ever come into this situation thinking &quot;Hey great, a whole bunch of people I can just toss onto the street without all that paperwork&quot;, but that&#39;s obviously what we&#39;re seeing here. This has hit all across NIH, other parts of HHS, the USDA, the Department of the Interior (the US Geological Survey and others), Commerce (including NOAA), Veteran&#39;s Affairs, you name it. The termination letters seem to mention performance issues, but that&#39;s an obvious legal fig leaf (that&#39;s one of the grounds for dismissal during the probationary period).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been told by sources inside the NIH that many there are hearing that all the Institute heads there are being asked to submit letters of resignation. The expectation is that many (although perhaps not all?) of these will be accepted, and these people will be out the door as well. Meanwhile, it appears that all the postdoctoral fellows have been fired from the CDC (probably again because they can be). And the anti-diversity witch hunt has been going on full blast - there are numerous reports of web sites and documents disappearing (as well as attacks on grant applications and the like) that seem to be based on little more than word/phrase searches. So mentions of microbial diversity in the gut, or the transition of a grassland to a forest, or homology between different viral strains - you know, squishy liberal stuff like that - are apparently being hit based on shortsighted malice and incompetence. Which is how I&#39;d characterize this whole business so far, honestly. The only signs of actual foresight recently seem to have been the targeting of people who are easiest to fire.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And getting back to the grant freeze that started this whole disaster off, I&#39;ve seen reports that the only study sessions that have taken place are ones that were announced in the Federal Register before the inauguration, and that none have appeared there since. This is causing a great deal of confusion - people are being asked to work on material (or assuming that they should work on such) for meetings that may well not take place at all. Inquiries seem to get unhelpful responses like &quot;We are moving forward as planned&quot;, which could mean two exact opposite outcomes (since if it&#39;s not been in the FR then by definition it hasn&#39;t been planned, you see). The people involved are either indifferent to all the trouble this is causing, or regard it as a desirable feature if they are aware, and I wouldn&#39;t rule that last possibility out.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;All of these actions (and more, such as the removal of public-facing data from web sites) are being subjected to legal challenges wherever possible. In almost every case, restraining orders and/or injunctions have been granted to stay these moves as they work through the court system (some of those hearings are taking place this coming week). But there&#39;s been more confusion (in some cases) about whether these orders are actually being obeyed, and that&#39;s really going to be the problem. My own guess is that the Trump administration will obfuscate and delay as long as possible on such moves, buying time cheaply to cause more damage. But eventually there&#39;s probably going to be a showdown that makes it up to the Supreme Court. And I frankly don&#39;t know what happens then.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s because all of this is new territory. We have had administrations that talked about government being too big and too obtrusive, but government did not get smaller during these periods, as is easy to check. But here we have things being dismantled, but with no heed whatsoever to the consequences. If you&#39;d told me about these actions years ago, or if you&#39;d told me that we would have RFK, Jr. as head of HHS, Tulsi Gabbard as DNI, and a Fox News host as Secretary of Defense, I would have assumed that the US had lost some sort of catastrophic war and these were the actions of a hostile occupation government. But here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

Really?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/computing-our-way-antibodies&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; a lot &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/antibodies-ai&quot;&gt;around here&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/try-antibody-over-here&quot;&gt;the use&lt;/a&gt; of ML/AI techniques for antibody design, and it&#39;s no wonder that a lot of money is being poured into this area. Proteins in general are riper territory for &lt;em&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt; design than small molecules (as witness the early successes of AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold), for a number of reasons. Chief among those is the way that we were able to train the models against a very large, very well-curated data set of real protein structures (a far larger collection than, say, the collection of structures of small molecules bound to proteins). And second is the way that protein folds and interaction motifs generally fall into a large-but-manageable set of similar styles. Then you throw in the advantages of antibodies on top of that: immunogenic privilege (much less likely to set off antigenic responses than random proteins), built-in metabolic stability, and so on.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But all those advantages still aren&#39;t enough to make it easy. And they shouldn&#39;t be enough to make you believe all the press releases about progress in the field, too. That&#39;s what you&#39;ll gather from this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/10/ai-drug-development-claims-by-biotech-companies-absci-generate-biomedicines-questioned/&quot;&gt;interesting &lt;em&gt;Stat&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt; by Brittany Trang. She&#39;s looking at the public statements of two of the small companies working in this area, Absci and Generate:Biomedicines, and finds that their claims are, well. . .&lt;em&gt;ambitious&lt;/em&gt; when compared to reality. &quot;. . .&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;aspiring AI pharma and biotech companies’ breathless claims can potentially mislead anyone not intimately familiar with the details of drug development, or machine learning&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, she writes, and boy is that ever the truth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, that&#39;s a long tradition in the small-biopharma world (and sometimes the large biopharma world, too, let&#39;s be honest). Most readers are not equipped to judge the plausibility of a proposed disease mechanism, the merits of some particular drug candidate aimed at it, or the intricacies of the clinical trial data that it might generate. Ideally, one would not take advantage of this informational asymmetry, but it seems pretty clear that we do not live in such a world. And it turns out that when you look at the antibodies that both of the above companies actually have in the clinic, they are not wonders of computation, designed &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; and bursting onto an unsuspecting world in a shower of special effects. No, they&#39;re all fast-follower version of existing approved antibody therapies. That&#39;s all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the thing is, there shouldn&#39;t really be any shame in that. These new versions are presumably thought to be better than what is already on the market, and who knows, maybe the computational techniques got them to that point faster. There &lt;em&gt;wouldn&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; be any shame if people hadn&#39;t hyped this as the Dawn of a Wonderous New World. If you look at the PR that both companies have put out, it&#39;s full of talk of AI-generated antibodies and medicines on demand, all that kind of thing. Not (as one of Trang&#39;s interviewees puts it) a business strategy of taking other people&#39;s drugs and tweaking them a bit. The article goes into great detail on this; I enjoyed it very much and that&#39;s not just because I&#39;m quoted in it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When are we going to see the first &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; protein drug? Well, as the article also goes into detail about, that very much depends on your definition of the term. A lot of people are going to claim it (have claimed it already!) and there will be endless room for argument about when the first really novel antibody makes it through. It&#39;s going to be years, let&#39;s put it that way. And no, it hasn&#39;t happened yet. No way and no how.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/ai-antibodies-really</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/ai-antibodies-really</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 01:13:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Stand Up And Be Counted</title><description>&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/11/nih-payment-costs-trump-pharma-industry-biotech/&quot;&gt;Here’s an editorial&lt;/a&gt; by Adam Feuerstein at &lt;i&gt;Stat&lt;/i&gt; that points out that in all the uproar about the Trump administration’s attacks on the NIH (and the NSF, and NOAA, and other science-based agencies), there’s a conspicuous zone of silence. And that’s the biopharma industry. It’s clear that almost everyone is keeping their heads down in the interest of “keeping lines of communication open” and so on.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Thanks for checking in. Nothing to share on this now,” a PhRMA media representative told STAT.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gilead Sciences, Eli Lilly, Biogen, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals declined comment, or didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Personally, I think people have commented negatively too much in the public domain in ways that could alienate the administration,” another biotech CEO told STAT, requesting anonymity to speak freely. . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . .STAT reached out to a broad swath of biotech and pharma executives, Wall Street analysts, and other observers, seeking to understand why the industry has chosen not to publicly defend universities and other academic research institutions facing&amp;nbsp; steep cuts in NIH funding. No one was willing to speak on the record.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Well, &lt;em&gt;I&#39;ll&lt;/em&gt; speak on the record. Get this down: it’s even worse than it looks. This gets back to my “three levels of corruption” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/pharma-sales-corruption-india-and-how&quot;&gt;idea&lt;/a&gt;, which I would summarize this way: Level 1 is &lt;em&gt;“Slip us come cash and we’ll do something extra for you”&lt;/em&gt;. Level 2 is &lt;em&gt;“Slip us some cash and we’ll actually do our job for once”&lt;/em&gt;. And Level 3 is &lt;em&gt;“Slip us some cash and nobody gets hurt”&lt;/em&gt;. The biopharma executives who are flying in for personal audiences with Trump or staying quiet while muttering about needed to keep up good relations are hoping for some Level 1 action, bracing for a lot of Level 2, and are terrified at the thought of Level 3.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;They should be. Level 3 corruption is where government short-circuits into becoming a protection racket. And that, I should add, is one of the only ways in which our current president is capable of seeing the world and all the transactions in it. He’s a real estate developer from Queens who came up as a protegé of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cohn&quot;&gt;Roy Cohn&lt;/a&gt; - of &lt;i&gt;course&lt;/i&gt; he does. His approach to dealing with Congress, to international relations, to trade, to most any issue at all is that of a mob boss: who’s shaking down whom, who gets the payoffs, who owes the favors, who takes a cut. (Any attempts to argue this point in the comments will be ignored; this stuff has been glaringly evident for many years).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;But that worldview is not (thank God) the ironclad rule of all human existence. Look at drug research: do big and small biopharma companies have an intellectual debt to NIH research? Oh, hell yes. Of course we do. A lot of academic research is purposely foundational - how would we not end up building on it? This is one of the many reasons why gutting academic research the way the administration proposes is such a catastrophically bad idea, but if you&#39;re a mob boss you&#39;re not equipped to understand that. Mind you, if you&#39;re a mob boss you might not care even if you did understand it, but still.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Never forget, though that the academic labs have intellectual debts to the industrial ones, too. We’re the people who put far more expense than they ever could into trying to turn these foundational ideas into disease treatments, to see if the hypothesis pans out, if there really are molecules that can do what is proposed, to exhaustively improve them until they could be human therapies, to find out (the hard way) what their liabilities might be, and to take on the ferocious financial burden and risk of taking them through controlled human trials. And we generate a lot of otherwise-unobtainable information along the way, as well as piles of useful tools for further research. We owe each other!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;It is a terrible mistake to look at all this as a zero-sum game of extortion and theft. As out of fashion as it is to talk this way, we are all really in this together. Academia and industry do different things most of the time, and we each benefit from that. And that’s why the silence from industry about what’s going on with the NIH &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. is so infuriating. It’s not that I can’t understand it; I see the self-preservation instincts. It’s just that I think they&#39;re being short-sighted, because fear does that to you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;So allow me to advocate a larger view. Gutting the NIH, NSF, CDC and others will demolish one of the pillars that holds up our entire research establishment. It will have terrible follow-on effects in all of biopharma - not tomorrow, not next week, but soon enough. And by the time you can unequivocally point to things that have started going wrong in industry because academic research has been stomped flat, it will be far too late to do anything about it. What&#39;s more, the methods being used to attack these agencies are &lt;em&gt;illegal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;unconstitutional&lt;/em&gt;. I am not exaggerating nor am I making some sort of joke here. If we let this happen - which will mean letting the Trump administration ignore the federal judiciary, or alternatively letting the judiciary neuter itself for fear of being completely brushed aside - then all bets are off. Look up one of the Trump movement&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Schmitt&quot;&gt;favorite legal scholars&lt;/a&gt; if you want a preview. We will have moved into a post-Constitutional era and will have become another country entirely and we&#39;re damned close to doing that now. And I think that Leonard Cohen was right when he said &quot;&lt;em&gt;You&#39;re not going to like what comes after America&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Biopharma CEOs: &lt;em&gt;what will protect you then&lt;/em&gt;? Speak up, speak up now. Because as it stands, you&#39;re forming up on the wrong side of a very important line. Time will not be kind.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/stand-and-be-counted</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/stand-and-be-counted</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 10:54:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Huntington&#39;s Disease, Cell by Cell</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%27s_disease&quot;&gt;Huntington&#39;s disease&lt;/a&gt; (HD) is of course very bad news: it&#39;s a progressive and ultimately fatal neurodegeneration that has no cure. What&#39;s more, there&#39;s nothing available yet that can even slow it down or help with its symptoms. We know a fair amount about it - for example, we know that it&#39;s caused by mutations in the gene for the Huntingtin protein (HTT), and such mutations can either be inherited or arise spontaneously. These mutations cause a trinucleotide repeat (CAG) in the middle of the sequence, which translates to poly-glutamine in the resulting protein. Over time, these repeats continue to lengthen, and eventually become toxic to the neurons that contain them. Most of us have inherited genes that have a dozen or two CAG repeats, but patients who develop HD almost invariably start out with mutant forms that have 36 to 55 of them. The disease generally starts showing up adulthood, and the damage shows up particularly in the striatum tissue of the brain, specifically a subtype of cells called straital projection neurons.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So that&#39;s valuable information for sure, but it leaves a number of mysteries unexplained. What&#39;s so toxic about those longer CAG repeats? Why do they only seem to cause trouble in those SPN cells? And why do those problems take so long to become apparent? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(24)01379-5&quot;&gt;A new paper&lt;/a&gt; has some surprising insights into these, and will probably cause some real changes in how HD is&amp;nbsp;approached. The authors analyzed a large collection of donated brain tissue at the NIH NeuroBioBank (from deceased HD sufferers and from controls who did not have the disease) and looked at CAG repeats on a single-cell basis (at both the DNA and RNA level).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The standard wisdom in the field for some time has been that the effects of CAG repeats must start showing up close to that 36-to-55 zone that patients start with, but this work finds little to no effect on gene expression in individual neurons that are up to 150 (!) repeats. That&#39;s far beyond what I think most people would have bet on. And sampling inside individual donor tissue shows that at any given time the number of SPN cells that are showing these &amp;gt;150 effects are rather small: 5 to 10 per cent of the total, even in people who are clearly showing effects of the disease.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But it also appears that the repeat-expansion mechanism is going on for almost all of such a neuron&#39;s life, but at very different rates. The expansion starts out slow and can move at that pace for decades, but it speeds up as the CAG length increases. The authors estimate that when a neuron crosses the 150-repeat limit that it probably will only survive a few more months. This means that the picture we&#39;ve had of HD of slow, constant, accumulating damage across a whole population of cells may well be mistaken. Instead, the disease is (as the authors put it) &quot;brief, asynchronous, and intense&quot; and happens neuron by neuron.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And all this means that some of our ideas for therapy may well be mistaken (or at best unlikely to succeed). The paper suggests that attempting to clear mutant Huntingtin protein is unlikely to work, for example. For one thing, some of the species that we&#39;ve believed to be toxic are still not causing any symptoms and are likely still functional in the cell (!) Instead, we should be focusing on trying to slow down the repeat-expansion process. Since it takes so long to hit the toxic levels, even a small rate slowdown could make a big difference in disease-free lifespan. The question is whether any given SPN has enough repeats to lead to eventual trouble within a human lifespan or not, and if the number is below 36, the answer is &quot;No, you should be fine&quot;. At higher numbers there still won&#39;t be symptoms, but in the absence of some means to slow things down, the writing is on the wall - and by the time those symptoms develop (even looking at the level of individual nerve cells) it is quite possibly too late to do anything meaningful about the problem. The key is to never get there in the first place!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As the authors note, such expansion-prevention therapies could be tried out in patients who are already showing early signs of the disease, which would be a faster and more straightforward way to prove this clinically than trying to do multiyear prevention trials in asymptomatic patients. The progression of Huntington&#39;s (as it stands now) is relentless, but if this paper&#39;s ideas are correct, slowing expansion would have a dramatic effect on that disease course, one that would be very easy to recognize and would have a large effect size.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that&#39;s going to have to be investigated is whether this sort of mechanism applies to the other trinucleotide-expansion diseases. There&#39;s a whole list of these, and they are all terrible, and progress in them would be extremely welcome. Friedrich ataxia, several types of spino-cerebellar ataxia, type I mytonic dystrophy, and more can use all the help they can get!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/huntington-s-disease-cell-cell</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/huntington-s-disease-cell-cell</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 01:28:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Continuing NIH/NSF Crisis, Part III: Indirect Costs</title><description>&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Part I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/revised-and-extended-what-s-happening-inside-nih-and-nsf&quot;&gt;is here&lt;/a&gt;, and Part II &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/continuing-nih-nsf-crisis-part-ii&quot;&gt;is here&lt;/a&gt;. But now we&#39;re faced with a whole new issue. . .)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Late on Friday came the unexpected and unwelcome news that the NIH is trying to cut the overhead payments in its external grants. If you’re not part of this ecosystem, that might sound like a pretty dull accouncement, but unfortunately, it’s anything but. If they manage to follow through on this (see later in this post for more on that), that one move is going to close academic medical research centers around the country and rip up a large part of the US’s world-leading biomedical research system.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;A quick explainer: when you receive a research grant (this is, after explaining how much money you want and what exactly you propose to spend it on and undergoing an arduous review process), there are direct funds that go to your lab and indirect funds that go to your institution. The direct funds are what most people see: they&#39;re how you pay salaries and for things like equipment and supplies (keeping in mind that some equipment can be so expensive that it’s the subject of a grant all by itself!) But there are indirect funds that go to your institution, and these pay for things like keeping the lights on, the physical plant in general, deliveries, waste disposal and environmental systems, the IT infrastructure, administrative costs (like the people who actually handle the process of ordering those supplies and negotiating prices with the companies involved), and much more.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;These indirect overhead costs (sometimes also known as facilities and administrative, F&amp;amp;A) are generally expressed as a percentage of the direct grant money, and they vary by the institution where the funds are being received. Typically those are stated to be in the 40% to 60% range for government grants, and lower for grants from private foundations. Those rates are set by negotiations between those institutions and the granting agencies at the government, and they come up for review periodically (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMB_Circular_A-21&quot;&gt;here&#39;s more&lt;/a&gt; on the OMB document that talks about all this). And that review process is a good thing, because those overhead costs have done nothing but increase over the years. There are a lot more compliance hoops to jump through, records to keep, controls that you have to show that you have in place, legal requirements and so on, and all of these add up. There is probably a discussion to be had about the cost-benefit of some of these, but it’s worth noting that private industry has seen similar effects over the years as well.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;What the NIH announced was that they are immediately cutting all these indirect grant monies back to 15%, and this applies to current grants as well as future ones. Doug Natelson &lt;a href=&quot;https://nanoscale.blogspot.com/2025/02/indirect-costs-potential-unintended.html&quot;&gt;noted at Nanoscale Views&lt;/a&gt; (a very good post in general) that the wording of the announcement, in real mob-boss style, came with an implicit warning that at least they didn’t go back and start asking for indirects that had already been paid out to be &lt;i&gt;returned&lt;/i&gt;. But the announcement was shocking and infuriating enough as it was. It was worded as an amazing savings for the US taxpayers and simultaneously a great boon to US research because now a higher percentage of the money would be going to actual research as opposed to, y’know, that other stuff.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;This is of course bullshit. Anyone who knows anything about scientific funding realized that immediately, and realized as well that this rule was going to punch a gigantic hole in the budgets of universities, research hospitals, scientific institutes and so on. Pretending that this is giving more money to research is laughable; pretending that this will make things better and more efficient is even more so. &lt;i&gt;Indirect research costs are real costs&lt;/i&gt;, and you can’t make them go away by just saying that you’re not going to pay for them. Try that sometime with your mortgage or your electric bill and see how that works for you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;No, the only way I can interpret this is as an attack on the academic research establishment (the same as that gratuitous “Hey, all your grants are frozen” stuff a couple of weeks ago). If you look into the Project 2025 documents, the hostility to academia leaps off the page: buncha liberal money-wasters, time they got it really good and hard. Well, this exercise in playground-level revenge is (if actually pursued) going to destroy one of the greatest scientific efforts in human history. Since World War II, funding scientific research is one of the things that the United States does, and it has paid enormous dividends. I saw some right-wing radio host making comments about how cutting all this funding was just what those dumb scientists deserved, etc., and remarked on social media that he talked a big game for someone who was using the internet on a cell phone. The number of technologies that have come about, in whole or in part, through public funding of research is beyond calculating. And the Trump administration is going to destroy it so they can smirk and preen.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Or are they? I’m expecting to see a host of lawsuits hitting today and in the next few days from states, universities, professors, and professional organizations fighting back about this change, and they have (i would say) a very good chance of prevailing. Update: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mass.gov/doc/ecf-complaint-mass-v-nih/download&quot;&gt;here we go&lt;/a&gt;! And Massachusetts is in the lead, with 21 more states. There should be more, because this isn&#39;t just going to screw things up in places like Massachusetts and California: it&#39;s going to hit even harder at the big red-state universities who are counting on these indirect costs to keep their medical research centers open at all. Not to mention hurting all the non-scientists who do all those tasks that are paid for by indirect cost grants, from accounting to IT maintenance to hauling gas cylinders and medical waste containers around. (Update 2: the judge in this case quickly blocked the administration&#39;s rule, but only in the 22 plaintiff states. The hearing is set for February 21). (Update 3: the ruling&#39;s scope was extended on Tuesday morning to all 50 states, which is good news for those institutions that are located in states with Republican attorneys general. You know, obscure outfits like the University of Texas, Ohio State, Emory, Vanderbilt, Iowa State, Washington U, Rice, Penn State and many, many more).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;This sudden change in funding is in fact against the law, in detail and on principle. The detail part &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/118/plaws/publ47/PLAW-118publ47.pdf&quot;&gt;is here&lt;/a&gt;: since 2018 there has been explicit language in the Congressional appropriations for the granting agencies prohibiting these kinds of changes, and the principle behind it is that Congress is the branch of government that holds the purse strings and determines how money should be spent. For more on the legal problems with this, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://goodscience.substack.com/p/indirect-costs-at-nih&quot;&gt;this analysis&lt;/a&gt;, written by a real lawyer who knows what he&#39;s talking about. A good deal of the new administration’s loudest noises, though, have been in trying to pretend that they are the ones who make all the spending decisions. Unfortunately, the thin Republican majority in the House appears quite willing to roll right over and abrogate their Constitutional role, and the Republican Senate has been no better. This dereliction of duty leaves it up to the Judiciary, and for an opinion on &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; we can turn to the Vice President, who said over the weekend that he thinks that Federal judges shouldn’t act as if they can decide what’s legal and shouldn’t be able to tell the Executive branch what to do. What he thinks their actual role is was left unexplained.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;We’re going to find out, though. We’ll find out on this issue and on others, and isn’t that just something I wish that I weren’t about to live through. Relitigating &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marbury v. Madison&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S8-C1-2-1/ALDE_00013356/&quot;&gt;Article I, Section 8&lt;/a&gt;: it&#39;s really something to see. No, if you want to do something so idiotic and destructive as slashing all federal research funding, then Congress has to do it. And I don’t think they have the nerve. They’d rather just pretend that it’s not something they can do - that’s a decision for the Big Boss Man, don&#39;t you know, just like everything else is. But if Congress decides that its role is to stand and clap for every idiotic idea coming from the Big Boss Man, no matter how illegal, then what exactly is their real function?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;There will be more of this stuff. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/jeremymberg.bsky.social&quot;&gt;Jeremy Berg&lt;/a&gt; has been warning that he expects a move to try to take most of the NIH money and turn it into &quot;block grants&quot; for states to fund their own research. We&#39;ll deal with that one when it shows up, but be braced. Bad ideas are in long supply.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/continuing-nih-nsf-crisis-part-iii-indirect</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/continuing-nih-nsf-crisis-part-iii-indirect</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 12:36:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Vaccines Through Protein Degradation</title><description>&lt;p&gt;We all got to learn about vaccines during the worst years of the pandemic (although it&#39;s clear that some people learned more than others, and a great many people &quot;learned&quot; a lot of things that aren&#39;t real). The mRNA vaccine platform is of course just the latest iteration in a long series of different vaccine varieties, and one of the earliest was the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine&quot;&gt;live attenuated virus&lt;/a&gt;&quot; technique. That one takes advantage of the actual pathogen, but modifies it so that it does not cause severe disease while it replicates in the body. That can give you robust immunity so long as the key antigen proteins remain close enough to the ones in the wild-type virus. You&#39;re getting a real viral infection and your immune systems goes into the full this-is-not-a-drill response, but that happens without actually getting the disease itself.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a nice trick, but it can be complicated to pull off. Some viruses just don&#39;t attenuate well in prolonged culture (which is the usual technique for finding and amplifying such weakened strains). Others have changed, but not always enough to be safe: you really don&#39;t want mutations that could allow an actual pathogen to emerge from the weakened form. As it stands, the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine is a prominent example of an attenuated vaccine that has shown very wide and successful use. The oral polio vaccine is another, but that one has on occasion mutated into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/The-urgent-need-to-stop-circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus-cVDPV-outbreaks.pdf&quot;&gt;pathogenic strain&lt;/a&gt; (cVDPV) when used in populations with very low overall polio immunity (which conditions allow the attenuated virus to spread and pick up more mutations along the way). This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/polio-never-take-viruses-granted&quot;&gt;showed up particularly&lt;/a&gt; after a 2016 switch in the live virus vaccination program, a stark reminder that you can never turn your back on these issues.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So a way to produce real attenuated viruses on demand as vaccines would be very interesting indeed, and a great deal of work has gone into various approaches over the years. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-024-01813-z&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; has a new one that looks promising. The idea is to engineer a virus so that its key proteins are vulnerable to the body&#39;s ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation system. Such a virus can enter cells and try to get going, but will find its spread compromised by having its proteins torn to pieces by the proteasome. And what&#39;s more, such proteosomal degradation is &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15180520/&quot;&gt;a key part&lt;/a&gt; of the cellular machinery that presents shorter antigen proteins to the immune system. If you do it right, you could end up with a strain that is enough to set off a good immune response, but is incapable of actually causing the real disease. Their first attempt at generating a &quot;PROTAR&quot; (proteolysis targeting) influenza vaccine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01381-4&quot;&gt;was reported&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. It did induce good immune responses in animal models, but it was limited by only having the proteolysis signal sequences (degrons, as they&#39;re known) attached at the ends of the target proteins.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;That was part of a design to allow them to replicate such viruses by attaching the degron through a cleavable linker - if you grew them in cells expressing the viral TEV protease, they could infect such cells in culture and replicate, but not in unaltered mammalian cells or actual animals. But that still leaves a vulnerability, if (for example) that cleavable linker mutates to become a substrate for other proteases. In their latest version, these degrons are scattered at more genomic/proteomic locations than before (across eight different viral proteins) and the TEV-linker idea has been dropped. The plan was to have the degons end up on the protein surfaces, so they could be recognized easily, but also to have them appear in loop regions that were less likely to ruin their actual function. In this version, you propagate these viruses in cells whose E3 ligase system has been knocked out (the very proteins, like VHL,&amp;nbsp; that recognize the degrons and start the ubiquitination process for destruction). Such modified viruses are not only attenuated, they are going to &lt;em&gt;stay&lt;/em&gt; attenuated.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Multiple control experiments showed that these viral proteins are indeed degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system in cells through VHL (or, in other candidates, by the E3 ligases SCF or TrCP through incorporation of their degron sequences). For extra efficacy and safety margins, the team produced PROTAR candidates that incorporated more than one of these in the same virus. These all replicated efficiently in the appropriate E3 knockout cells, but their replication was attenuated by factors of hundreds of thousands to million-fold in normal cells. Those replication results carried over to animal models as well.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that they also still work to induce immunity. A single intranasal dose of their top candidate set off robust immune responses across the board (humoral, mucosal, and T-cell driven). Viral challenges after three weeks in these animals showed basically complete protection against more than one strain of flu virus, which is a very good sign. The team went on to demonstrate similar results when starting from a different influenza A viral sequence and from an influenza B one as well, suggesting that these results could generalize well.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is really interesting work and seems to be off to a strong start. The authors mention a number of areas for future development, and anyone involved in vaccine work or virology will be able to think of some! I look forward to seeing how this develops; we really need all the good ideas we can get in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/vaccines-through-protein-degradaion</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/vaccines-through-protein-degradaion</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 11:39:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>An Evaluation of &quot;Deep Research&quot; Performance</title><description>&lt;p&gt;OK, let&#39;s have some science today, for sanity&#39;s sake. You may have heard about the latest software release from OpenAI, &quot;Deep Research&quot;, a version of their &lt;span&gt;OpenAI o3 model that is optimized to search through online sources and produce reports from them.&lt;/span&gt; It&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/&quot;&gt;billed as&lt;/a&gt; &quot;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;An agent that uses reasoning to synthesize large amounts of online information and complete multi-step research tasks for you&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, and immediately I am reminded of why OpenAI gets on my nerves so much. I strongly dispute the &quot;uses reasoning&quot; part of that claim, although I realize that this rapidly gets into the sort of argument that Alice had in Lewis Carroll&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Through the Looking Glass&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&quot;When I use a word,&quot; Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, &quot;it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less&quot; &quot;The question is,&quot; said Alice, &quot;whether you can make words mean so many different things.&quot; &quot;The question is,&quot; said Humpty Dumpty, &quot;which is to be master - that&#39;s all.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Someone with paid access to the software graciously agreed to run a test of it for me, and the query I chose was &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;I want you to write a research report on summarize the toxic effects of thalidomide with respect to different species and different isomers of the compound, and what’s known about the mechanism for those effects&lt;/em&gt;.&quot; I chose that for several reasons. First off, it&#39;s a reasonably technical topic, and I wanted to see how the Deep Research system dealt with the chemistry and toxicology literature in general. Second, it&#39;s one with several complications, and there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/thalidomide-mirror&quot;&gt;many misconceptions&lt;/a&gt; that have proven difficult to get rid of. Then there&#39;s the way that the drug was understandably mostly abandoned for many years, but made a comeback (despite the toxicity) as a treatment for some forms of cancer. Another complication is that the mechanisms for those terrible effects were mysterious for a long time, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1177319&quot;&gt;discovery&lt;/a&gt; in 2010 that it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/thalidomide-bound-its-target&quot;&gt;bound to a protein&lt;/a&gt; called cereblon revolutionized things. And that discovery in turn has led to a new wave of drug candidates that often contain thalidomide-like substructures to take advantage of targeted protein degradation. It&#39;s definitely a topic with some heft to it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;background context&quot; question in the software was filled in like this: &quot;&lt;em&gt;I am looking to demonstrate the value of your reports to a chemistry PhD who is skeptical, and am hoping the final report demonstrates analytical ability beyond summarizing a Wikipedia page and a breadth of knowledge capable of understanding edge cases and nuanced outcomes&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, and I&#39;d say that&#39;s fair. And for &quot;scope and depth&quot;, this was provided: &quot;&lt;em&gt;This report should be constrained to (1)&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;the toxic effects of thalidomide with respect to (a) different species (b) different isomers of the compound and (2)&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-tab-span&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;What is known about the mechanism for those effects&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Within this scope, it would be preferable to be quite detailed as your work will be scrutinized by a subject matter expert.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; And the request was to &quot;&lt;em&gt;Please conduct multi-step research across the web to find the best possible sources. You may: 1. Search for initial keywords and refine as you learn more. 2. Visit reputable sites, journals, or official databases related to the topic. 3. Synthesize information from multiple articles, PDFs, or studies. 4. Expand or pivot the search as needed based on new insights&lt;/em&gt;.&quot; And the output was requested to include references.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So with that stage set, what did I get? Well, the report came back with an Executive Summary to start off with, followed by a detailed analysis section, and some tables to illustrate the main points. Overall, it was a pretty competent piece of work, (although read on!) and I was pleased to note that the output referenced many reviews from the literature as well as primary sources from PubMed abstracts. It was clear, well-organized, and grammatical, and I was glad to see (for example) that the report emphasized that the two optical isomers of thalidomide interconvert rapidly&lt;em&gt; in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, making it impossible to avoid its teratogenic effects by only dosing one enantiomer (which is a mistake that you still see people promulgating even now). Overall, if you did not know the details of thalidomide&#39;s toxicity before reading, you would come away with a much better grasp of the topic. However. . .&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And you knew that there was going to be a &quot;however&quot; in there! A closer look showed some interesting problems with the report. One overall effect was that while Deep Research did cite the literature extensively, it seemed not to value more recent work over earlier reports, which to me is an essential part of dealing with scientific publications. There were several cites from the primary literature from the 1980s, for example (and multiple uses of these), and since the report was not trying to put things in historical context these should mostly have been over the horizon here in 2024. This showed up when summarizing the mechanisms for the compound&#39;s toxic effects, because I detected what I think was a &quot;completeness bias&quot;, an effort to list more possibilities than strictly needed to be listed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll show you what I mean by that. The cereblon-binding mechanism is of course the biggest part of the story, especially when referring to the teratogenic effects. And the report did a good job on that, even mentioning the two amino acid changes in rodent cereblon versus human that lead to key changes in compound binding and subsequent protein degradation behavior. (This is all language summarized directly out of the published literature, of course, but it&#39;s good to have picked that up and it did so without garbling things along the way). The Deep Research model tried to summarize all this with reference to the differences across species, and ended up with a kitchen-sink approach that also mentioned metabolic differences in rodents versus humans, differences in plasma protein binding and clearance between species, and went off into things like this (direct quote): &quot;&lt;em&gt;One paper noted that species differences could stem from different activation/deactivation of the drug, as suggested by thalidomide&#39;s case. In essence, rodents may deactivate thalidomide (or fail to bioactivate it) relative to primates, reducing teratogenic impact&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. This all referenced &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3104022/&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; from 1986, and unfortunately these hypotheses have been superseded by the later discovery of the cereblon mechanism. As mentioned the Deep Research output does go into cereblon, but it seems incapable of putting these things into perspective relative to each other and also seems to go out of its way to suggest alternative explanations, even when time has not borne these out. (You&#39;ll also note the strange &quot;as suggested by thalidomide&#39;s case&quot; phrase in there, which comes from more-or-less direct quotation from the primary source although it is not marked as such in the output.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Another problem I noticed turned on the use of the word &quot;stability&quot;. This showed up as the software summarized the racemization of thalidomide&#39;s chiral center, and in that case &quot;stability&quot; refers to the reactivity/tautomerization at that single carbon and the subsequent loss of chiral integrity. But the output also talks about thalidomide&#39;s plasma half-life and metabolic stability, where the issue is the entire compound being hydrolyzed or oxidatively chewed up into new compounds. I noticed that the Deep Research output tended to confuse these points, doubtless due to the same word being used to describe both of them in the literature. A mention of one of them would (by the end of the sentence) have slid into the other, and if you&#39;re using this to learn new material you will end up being confused in turn.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s also a pronounced &quot;scope of question&quot; effect. You&#39;ll note that the charge was to discuss thalidomide&#39;s toxicity with reference to its isomers and its effects across species, and I&#39;ll definitely say that the Deep Research output stayed on topic. There are glancing references to the drug&#39;s current uses (although certainly not all of them) and brief mentions of later analogs like pomalidomide. But in the discussion of the cereblon-binding mechanism, the output resists at all times the opportunity to mention that this led to an entirely new field of chemical biology and drug discovery, the now well-known targeted protein degradation. I doubt if any human putting together a file like this would have let that go past, and (in my opinion) it&#39;s a big enough omission to be a defect.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As with all LLM output, all of these things are presented in the same fluid, confident-sounding style: you have to know the material already to realize when your foot has gone through what was earlier solid flooring. That, to me, is one of their most pernicious features. I know that these things were not designed &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; to glide over or hide their weak points and their mistakes, but they do a terrific job of it, and that&#39;s not really what you want. So as much as I found some parts of the Deep Research output impressive, I found its deeper research problems hard to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/evaluation-deep-research-performance</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/evaluation-deep-research-performance</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 08:57:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Continuing NIH/NSF Crisis, Part II</title><description>&lt;p&gt;This will be part of a series of posts on the current crisis around the Trump administration and science funding. Part I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/revised-and-extended-what-s-happening-inside-nih-and-nsf&quot;&gt;is here&lt;/a&gt;, and I will continue to link through the whole series each time. I&#39;m doing this because news continues to accumulate, and it&#39;s a situation of great importance. But at the same time I plan to keep posting actual science content as usual, to help maintain my own mental balance if nothing else (!) Please note that I can be contacted by email (&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:derekb.lowe@gmail.com&quot;&gt;derekb.lowe@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;), by direct message on BlueSky (@dereklowe.bsky.social), and also on Signal (Dblowe.18)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;(1) There is all sorts of confused activity around the Executive Orders that related to diversity, equity, inclusion, and gender status and rights. Yesterday I heard from someone at one of the Florida universities that faculty there had received a memo about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_14148&quot;&gt;EO 14148&lt;/a&gt;, which is mostly devoted to recission of previous EOs on these subjects. The memo noted that all DEIA activities required by federal contracts or grants thus had to cease, and that any contract or grant that uses/promotes such principles should also cease immediately. At the same time, I&#39;ve heard from faculty at other institutions in other states (and even others inside Florida) that they have received no such notices as of yet. So someone appears to getting extra zealous. I would of course be interested in hearing about other such situations as they develop, since it&#39;s my belief that once you open the door to interference with already-awarded grants that closing it again will be difficult.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;(2) I have a report from someone who had a paper already reviewed, accepted, and posted at a Sage journal who received an unexpected communication from a staffer at the publisher. &lt;span&gt;They asked that the paper be revised at this point to replace any of &quot;gender&quot; with &quot;sex&quot; and to delete all mentions of words such as nonbinary, inclusivity, etc. Otherwise, they said that they would pull the paper, citing the provision of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_14168#Organizations&quot;&gt;EO 14168&lt;/a&gt; (which is the one going after transgender rights). The faculty member who got this notice was taken aback, since the study that the paper describes was not federally funded in any way (!) And last time I checked Sage is not part of the U. S. government, so I am struck by their sudden eagerness to comply with an executive order that does not apply to them in any way. This does not seem to have been a random mistake - when the author involved asked for clarification, the editor of the journal replied reiterating the request.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(3) The situation around NIH and NSF study sessions and advisory panels remains &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/article/trump-orders-cause-chaos-science-agencies&quot;&gt;chaotic&lt;/a&gt;. I frankly have been unable to put together a coherent picture amid the freezes, cancellations, postponements, and reschedulings that are being reported. I have seen reports from people saying that they were planning on serving as Scientific Review Officers (SROs) in meetings today, which would be good news. But other reports have it that study sessions are still on hold, and the situation may well vary inside different parts of the NIH and NSF. I hope to get some more clarity about this; these study sessions need to restart as quickly as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(4) &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/alexwenzel.bsky.social/post/3lhhngbxd222e&quot;&gt;This report&lt;/a&gt; about the new NSF director does not build confidence in his leadership, in case you needed another reason to doubt it. Someone stepped in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sethuraman_Panchanathan&amp;amp;diff=next&amp;amp;oldid=1272359632&quot;&gt;and removed&lt;/a&gt; the entire &quot;Controversies&quot; section from his Wikipedia article, which is the part that describes a lawsuit filed against him in 2021 for gender discrimination. The IP address that did the revisions resolves to. . .the NSF.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(5) Meanwhile, the &quot;Fork in the Road&quot; memo that urged Federal employees to resign has a deadline of today. I have not heard of how many people at NIH, NSF et al. are actually taking advantage of this, but overall it appears that uptake is going to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.splinter.com/as-deferred-resignation-deadline-looms-federal-employees-are-mad-as-hell-and-not-going-anywhere&quot;&gt;considerably lower&lt;/a&gt; than the administration had in mind. None of the people I&#39;ve been in contact with seem to be accepting. Federal employee unions have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wgbh.org/news/national/2025-02-04/white-house-defends-its-fork-in-the-road-offer-to-federal-employees&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that the offer is very likely illegal (under existing hiring laws and contracts) and as such no one can expect those who offered it to even feel bound by its terms. &lt;em&gt;Update: the entire offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/national-international/judge-temporarily-blocks-federal-worker-deferred-resignation-program-amid-legitimacy-questions/3837955/&quot;&gt;has been blocked&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon by a Federal judge in Boston in response to a request for a formal restraining order - hearings on that are set for Monday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;(6) I can confirm the reports that staff at the FDA are all being told that there is a 100% return to office coming. If you&#39;re within 50 miles of an FDA office, the date is March 17th, and outside of 50 miles it&#39;s as of April 28th. One interesting thing is that this is all being done verbally, one on one. No email, no presentations, no web sites. The immediate suspicion is that this is to avoid leaving a paper trail for any union action. Many FDA employees have been represented for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nteu.org/media-center/news-releases/2016/04/13/fda-employees-vote-for-representation-by&quot;&gt;several years now&lt;/a&gt; by the National Treasury Employees Union, and the NTEU has responded to it members, saying that it&#39;s aware of these supervisor conversations and that &quot;FDA supervisors have refused to provide these instructions in writing and may have even issued threats regarding removal from federal service&quot; while delivering their message. The speculation is that the &quot;Fork in the Road&quot; memo didn&#39;t get nearly enough takers (before it was put on hold this afternoon, its deadline day) and that this is likely another effort to get people to leave. There are worries (just as at the NIH) about probationary staffers who don&#39;t have as many protections from being fired on short notice.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What no one understands is how this will work with people who are close to some agency site that isn&#39;t where they were working before, or whether actual assignments will be changed. There are, for example, many remote workers who have been telecommuting into the Silver Spring, MD facility, but they won&#39;t necessarily have that as their official duty station in a return-to-office world. The uncertainty might be a feature, too, actually. More on this as details emerge.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/continuing-nih-nsf-crisis-part-ii</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/continuing-nih-nsf-crisis-part-ii</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 01:43:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Revised and Extended: What&#39;s Happening Inside the NIH and NSF</title><description>&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Addendum, Wednesday Feb 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Regrettably, I have to extend this post due to even more news. The assault on scientific funding and agencies continues, for one thing. Since I posted this, Elon Musk&#39;s team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/doge-noaa-headquarters&quot;&gt;has entered the offices of NOAA&lt;/a&gt;, since their remit of weather forecasting and climate science has made them a target for the sort of people who believe that any talk of climate change is some sort of liberal plot. Granting opportunities having anything to do with diversity&amp;nbsp; have disappeared from NIH sites, and I have seen reports that the option to request grant extensions has disappeared. There are reports of Musk staffers on the CDC campus today, and yesterday an NSF official said at an internal meeting that the agency is apparently planning to lay off &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eenews.net/articles/science-funding-agency-threatened-with-mass-layoffs/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;up to half its staff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over the next two months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;This is all having exactly the results you would expect in the scientific community: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/us-scientists-trump-executive-orders&quot;&gt;fear and disruption&lt;/a&gt;, which I&#39;m afraid are two of the goals from the start. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;My prediction that what is being done to the NIH, NSF &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; was just a preview of what the new administration intends to do to the rest of the government appears to be accurate. The Office of Personnel Management, following up on its bizarre &quot;Fork in the Road&quot; memo, is telling Federal employees that they are in danger of missing a &quot;once in a lifetime chance&quot; to leave their jobs, which is clearly an effort to panic people into leaving. Agents and staff at the FBI are under attack by the administration is what is clearly retaliation for investigations of the January 6, 2020 insurrection, and the CIA has apparently sent a buyout offer to its entire workforce in what looks like an attempt to gut the agency. And the entire Department of Education is said to be targeted for attempted abolishment by Executive Order. That&#39;s just as of this morning. There will be more. Elon Musk has said recently that his goal is to have no regulations at all - they&#39;ll just put some back in if any turned out to be useful after all. I think that&#39;s bullshit from him, and that he&#39;s mostly looking to terrify people while he gets rid of the rules that he finds inconvenient to his businesses or personally annoying. But that&#39;s more than bad enough, and has nothing to do with how we supposedly run this country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Almost all of these actions are illegal, and many are actually unconstitutional. The administration is obviously daring someone to try to stop them, and as mentioned in Part Six below, right now that&#39;s the Federal Judiciary. The Republican majority in the Senate and the much slimmer one in the House have signaled that they (so far) are completely uninterested in doing anything about all this - whatever Trump wants, they&#39;re in favor of. This seems to be due to a mixture of outright agreement, criminal indifference, fear of losing their positions, and (let&#39;s be frank) fear of actual physical violence from the kinds of supporters that Trump attracts. It&#39;s not exactly what James Madison had in mind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;We are getting very close to a moment when a judge issues an injunction and the Trump/Musk people just wave it off and keep doing what they&#39;re doing, a &quot;Yeah, now enforce it, make us stop&quot; crisis that could quickly shred what remains of constitutional order. I realize that I sound like an paranoid fool, but I see no other conclusion to be drawn. We have to support the rule of law with our voices and actions, loudly and consistently. &lt;strong&gt;The re-election of Donald Trump now looks like it could be the worst act of American self-destruction since the Civil War&lt;/strong&gt;: don&#39;t roll over and just let it happen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Now to Tuesday&#39;s post below, as written yesterday:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Intro:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;This is a long post, and it just keeps getting longer although I keep removing curse words. If you only have time for some of it, see Part Two and Part Six.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;It&#39;s become apparent that the Trump Administration is trying to make major changes to the way that the scientific funding agencies of the US government operate. That&#39;s about as neutrally as I can put it: my own opinion is that said changes (as they appear at the moment) are an outrage, a vindictive ideological assault on agencies that (for all their flaws) have helped produce major scientific advances in more fields than I can name. But let&#39;s go into the details so you can see why I think that way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;I have to say up front that I&#39;ve been working on (and reworking) this post for the last few days as I get more information. At first it looked like the NIH, NSF, CDC et al. were being singled out for special treatment, and I devoted some thought about why that might be. There is no shortage of plausible (albeit shameful) explanations, but recent events argue that the entire federal government is in line for the same sort of contemptuous working-over, at least if the administration gets its way. I&#39;ll concentrate on the agencies named above, though, since they are closest to the usual subject matter of this site and because what&#39;s happening to them may well be a preview of what Trump and his people would like to see happen over and over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part One: The Organizations As They Now Exist&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The first thing to do is sketch out how things are (or have been?) organized. The NIH (the primary player in the biomedical fields) is inside the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and is made up of 27 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_institutes_and_centers_of_the_National_Institutes_of_Health&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;different institutes and research centers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, many of which (such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) are famous in their own right. There are layers involved - for example, all of us in the biomedical field make use of PubMed, the searchable literature database that attempts to cover a huge swath of the open scientific literature in medicine, biology, chemistry, and related fields. PubMed is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;National Center for Biotechnology Informatio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;n (NCBI), which also includes the GenBank database, and the NCBI itself is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Library_of_Medicine&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which is one of those 27 branches and is the largest collection of its type in the world. Many of the institutes are disease-area-focused (the NCI, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Allergy_and_Infectious_Diseases&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and so on). In addition, the NIH helps oversee &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency_for_Health&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;ARPA-H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the recently created Advanced Research Projects for Health, which is itself another agency inside the Department of Health and Human Services. All of them disperse grant money for extramural research, and they also have smaller budgets for intramural research which is carried out in the NIH&#39;s own lab facilities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is yet another agency under the HHS umbrella, while the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;NSF (National Science Foundation)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an independent agency (although not cabinet level) that handles nonmedical scientific research, although it should be noted that there are other outlays in those nonmedical science areas from the Department of Energy and others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;There&#39;s a lot of money involved, but as with all government spending it helps to put these things in perspective. If you look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fy-2024-budget-in-brief.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;entire HHS budget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, ($1.7 trillion in outlays), 50% of that is Medicare, 33% of it is Medicaid, and other assistance programs take up another 8%. Thus only 9% of the 1.7 HHS budget (about 153 billion) go towards all discretionary outlays, and of that the NIH spends $46 billion and the CDC spends $13.5 billion. The entire NSF had outlays of about $9 billion. The biggest single share of the NIH budget goes to the NCI ($7.8 billion in 2024), and the second-most to the NIAID ($6.5 billion) with the National Institute of Aging coming in third at $4.4 billion. (See the tables on numbered pages 11 and 46 of that link at the beginning of the paragraph for the details).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;And to put those &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60843/html#:~:text=Outlays%20in%20fiscal%20year%202024,percent)%20more%20than%20in%202023.&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;into perspective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the largest single oulay for the Federal government is Social Security benefits ($1.4 trillion by themselves), with interest on the national debt coming in second at $949 billion, Medicare comes in third at $870 billion, and the Department of Defense fourth at $826 billion and Medicaid next at $618 billion. NIH and NSF money are buried deep in the &quot;other&quot; category when you look at things at that level. As does foreign aid, I should note as another comparator: USAID had outlays of about $35 billion in FY2024, not that you can get that from their web site, which is completely down at the moment thanks to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/02/02/g-s1-46007/usaid-web-site-trump-state-department&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;bunch of activity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend that looks &lt;i&gt;prima facie&lt;/i&gt; illegal if not downright unconstitutional. We will leave &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;inhumane&quot; out there for thought as well. It should be mentioned at this point that these real numbers are not what most members of the general public would guess: the amounts spent on foreign aid, for example, are often &lt;a href=&quot;https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/poll-use-of-federal-taxpayer-dollars/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;wildly overestimated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And although reducing overall spending is fairly popular (although not overwhelmingly so) the details of just where you would cut tend to get hazy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/29/americans-want-spending-cuts-just-not-those-ones-or-those-ones/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;very quickly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part Two: What&#39;s Been Happening&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Well, as anyone who&#39;s been reading the headlines knows, there has been a ridiculous amount of turmoil. On Monday, January 27th the Office of Management and Budget put out a memo freezing all government grants, loans, and other forms of financial assistance (first reported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/independent-journalists-trump-local-news-a60b49c97058d14f1b2e36cdc771d8f7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Marisa Kabas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This was, well, unexpected - never before had anyone attempted to hit the brakes in that manner, and all sorts of confusion ensued. What grants did this cover (existing ones in progress, new ones, or?) and was this pause supposed to take place immediately (and if so, how?), and if it was indeed supposed to be immediate, what the hell was supposed to happen to people? With NIH and NSF grants, you had labs who were already depending on these funds to run their research and pay their staff members: how were these facilities and these people supposed to survive? It appears that many people in the Trump administration had no idea of the answers to these questions, and had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/trump-funding-freeze-rollout.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;not even seen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the memo before it was sent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, other directives had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/22/trump-administration-orders-health-communications-pause-cdc-hhs-fda/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;already gone out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; telling everyone in these agencies to cease all public communications. We&#39;re not just talking blog posts here, either: the CDC&#39;s widely read MMWR (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report) has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/24/g-s1-44613/cdc-nih-hhs-health-data-mmwr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;ceased to appear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in decades - a widely used public health tool yanked for no good reason that anyone has been able to explain. The NIH &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/22/trump-administrations-cancels-scientific-meetings-abruptly/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;was told&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to suspend all meetings until further notice, which included grant review study sessions and advisory committee meetings. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/27/nx-s1-5276342/nsf-freezes-grant-review-trump-executive-orders-dei-science&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Similar freezes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; went into effect at the NSF, throwing the complex timetable of grant initiations and renewals into unprecedented chaos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Last Wednesday the 29th, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-pause-federal-grants-aid-6d41961940585544fa43a3f66550e7be&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;terse memo went out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; rescinding the grant-freeze orders, though. But the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt immediately undermined whatever effect that had by saying on Elon Musk&#39;s X platform that &quot;This is NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze. It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo&quot;, whatever the hell that was supposed to mean. A multi-state lawsuit had already been filed in federal court by the relevant Attorneys General, and Leavitt&#39;s statement was enough for the judge to allow it to proceed anyway on Wednesday afternoon. On Friday, January 31, the judge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/nonprofits-sue-trump-administration-over-federal-grants-freeze/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;issued a restraining order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; blocking the funding freeze until the plaintiffs filed for a formal injunction and the judge ruled on that in turn. That has now taken place, and Judge Loren Alikhan issued a sweeping order on Monday to stop the funding freezes and any further attempts to implement them while proceedings continue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;But that&#39;s not all. It&#39;s also become apparent that these agencies (and many others) are being targeted particularly regarding any programs directed towards women or minorities. There has been a government-wide purge going on of references to any sorts of DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) criteria, and indeed, various elected and unelected officials have for some time now been using &quot;DEI&quot; as a scapegoat term and apparently a shorter way of casting suspicion on anything that is not being run by some white guy. As a white guy myself, I find this phenomenally offensive, and I can&#39;t even imagine how I&#39;d be feeling about it as a direct target of this garbage. Later on Monday it &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/darbysaxbe.bsky.social/post/3lhcvn4hxwk2o&quot;&gt;was reported&lt;/a&gt; by Darby Saxbe at USC that the new NSF administrators are working from a long list of words and phrases (things like “underrepresented”, “socioeconomic”, or “community”)&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;that will cause grants (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/article/nsf-reexamines-existing-awards-comply-trump-s-directives&quot;&gt;including existing ones&lt;/a&gt;) to face further review.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, large chunks of websites from the CDC and others that relate to women&#39;s health and the like have been disappearing all weekend, and it appears that an even larger purge is underway of all public-facing CDC databases. Fortunately, it appears that &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/20250128-cdc-datasets&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;archives are available&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and that link reminds me to urge people to &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/donate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;give money&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the Internet Archive people and to Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;https://donate.wikimedia.org/w/index.php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;as well&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you can, because independent sources of information do not seem to be popular right now with some of the people in power. As for me, I&#39;m using my employer&#39;s offer of matching funds for such donations, and you should look into that as well if it&#39;s available to you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part Three: On the Inside&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve been hearing from several sources about what this looks like from inside the agencies, and as you&#39;d imagine, it&#39;s a mess. No one at the NIH, NSF, etc. has ever had to go through something like this before - there&#39;s no one to ask about what happened last time and no rulebook to follow. There are disruptions in all parts of these organizations - the extramural research offices funding outside grants at universities have of course been directly targeted by the freeze order, and the intramural research labs are under pressure as well. You&#39;ll get a feel for that when you see the timeline for everyone inside the NIH, which went something like this:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;First, All travel canceled until at least the end of April. The the no-public-communications order went out. Next the websites and pages with any mention of diversity programs started to go down, and at this time everyone &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2025/01/22/nx-s1-5270081/trump-executive-orders-dei&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;got a memo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; urging them to report any attempts to disguise such programs (!) The Office of Personnel and Management (OPM) then asked for a list of all employees who could be dismissed without any civil service protections (probationary employees), and around that time all funding and internal spending was frozen. All federal agencies were by this point asked to suspend any work involving the World Health Organization and other global health initiatives. Then the Acting NIH Director was replaced, and the new Acting Director (Matthew Memoli) sent out a memo that caused even more confusion. It directed people (among other things) not to initiate any new studies after January 20th (Inauguration Day). This was such a disaster that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/article/nih-memo-addresses-confusion-about-restrictions-imposed-trump-easing-some-concerns&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;another memo had to go out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; within a few days trying to clarify (and perhaps walk back) many of its points (see below).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Then came the halt of any new publications along with a ban on using preprint servers, along with the OMB freeze on grants mentioned above (and which has for the moment been rolled back, as already detailed). But right after this, most of the Federal workforce (very much including HHS employees, NIH and CDC therein, as well as NSF) got the now-infamous &quot;Fork in the Road&quot; memo. This basically urged everyone to resign if at all possible, complete with bizarre statements about how perhaps it was time to take a &quot;dream vacation&quot; and how much more productive everyone would be in the private sector. It also contained what can only be interpreted as not-so-veiled threats about instituting &quot;Performance Culture&quot;, re-organizations, layoffs, stripping of civil service employment protections, and investigations into individual conduct. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/business/dealbook/musk-trump-federal-buyouts.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;similarities in tone and content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to Elon Musk&#39;s purges after taking over Twitter have not gone unnoticed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The second Memoli memo at least made clear that people could order lab supplies if these were related to human safety or human or animal health care, and that travel for such work could also continue. Everything contracted before January 20th could proceed, but the NIH&#39;s intramural researchers were still restricted from starting any new studies not planned before that date. Supposedly the study section meetings are resuming starting this week as well, but I will wait to see if that&#39;s actually happening (there were reports late on Monday that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/article/nih-eases-freeze-grant-reviews-imposed-after-trump-communications-pause&quot;&gt;they are resuming&lt;/a&gt;). God knows the disruption in those so far has been enough. This is of course not the way to run a healthy research organization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;And neither are the directives that have come down in the last few days. It has been reported from several sources (starting with Jeremy Faust at &lt;a href=&quot;https://insidemedicine.substack.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Inside Medicine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that CDC scientists have been ordered to retract any manuscripts that are in the process of publication that mentions topics or even phrases such as gender, transgender, pregnant person, pregnant people, LGBT, transsexual, non-binary, assigned male/female at birth, or biologically male/female. This goes for manuscripts that have been submitted, and also for ones that have been accepted but not yet formally published - all of these are to pulled back and edited. I would assume that a similar policy is going to be extended to all of the NIH, but the CDC is where it has first shown up. And obviously new manuscripts (and new research) that might mention one of these newly forbidden terms would not seem to be welcome.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part Four: What Comes Next?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;That&#39;s a hell of a question, isn&#39;t it? We&#39;ve already blown past so many norms of behavior (and past a number of outright laws and provisions of the Constitution) that guessing what might come down the chute tomorrow is difficult. The things that have already been said are terrible enough, but there are a lot of things that &lt;i&gt;haven&#39;t&lt;/i&gt; been said, either. Are the study sessions for grants going to resume as before, and if so, when? Is intramural research in the various NIH branches going to be targeted under the banner of cutting costs? What other subjects are going to be struck off as Unacceptable Topics?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;As it stands now, scientists in these organization who are from outside the US have to be wondering about their futures: can they leave, how soon could it be arranged, where would they go? And as mentioned above, those people in the probationary category (who do not have civil service protections against being fired outright) are in an awful bind. They got the same memo as everyone else that makes it sound as if the new management would be happy if everyone just left. From what I&#39;m told, the great majority of NIH staffers (probationary or not) are working on their CVs (or asking themselves why they aren&#39;t) and trying to find somewhere to land should things get worse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;This would be a drain of expertise and experience that would take many years to get over. It&#39;s not just the scientists in the labs (although God knows that&#39;s bad enough). The people who organize the study sessions and handle the entire extramural grant application and award process have skills that have been built up over many years, for example. And if the NIH granting apparatus is &quot;paused&quot; for as little as two months, things will indeed begin to fall apart as the effects roll down to the universities and research groups involved, disrupting the entire biomedical academic research structure across the country. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;I’ve spoken to academic researchers who are on the receiving end of these grants, and naturally enough they’re very worried. On Monday the main electronic portal for these things (eRA Commons) was down for several hours, and people were worried about when and if it might actually come back up. That statement would have sounded ridiculous a few weeks ago, but as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.srhlab.com/about&quot;&gt;Sarah Hengel&lt;/a&gt; at Tufts put it, “I never thought anything like this would happen in my lifetime”.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It’s important to realize that NIH grant funds are not just paying for reagents and supplies; they’re paying salaries. Graduate students, for example, are already partway through their multiyear PhD programs, working in the lab with stipends paid out of these grants: what do they do if things stay “frozen”? The professors involved (like Prof. Hengel) feel as if these young researchers, ones that they’ve taken on with an implicit promise to mentor them towards their degrees and to develop them as scientists, are being hung out to dry. Everyone involved is being jerked around, and for what?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Thinking about that sort of senseless disruption brings us to a big question.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part Five: Why is All This Happening?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Some of it is the &quot;starve the beast&quot; philosophy that many of Trump&#39;s team have. This is amply laid out in the Project 2025 documents, and let me say right here that I was volcanically pissed off at the way that topic was handled during the campaign. The provisions in that large and not always cohesive set of plans for a new administration proved terribly unpopular as they began to be publicized, causing the Trump campaign (and Trump himself) to disavow them. Not us, never heard of them, etc. &lt;i&gt;And many large news organizations let them get away with it&lt;/i&gt;. &quot;Oh well, false alarm, he says it&#39;s not his plan, so what else is going on?&quot; Of course, in reality, many of the Project 2025 authors worked in the first Trump administration, had never left that ecosystem, had been praised by Trump himself over the years for their great work, and many of them now have positions in the government to do exactly what it said they were going to do all along.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;And one of those things is to dismantle as much of the Federal government as possible. They regard it as a tax-sucking parasite on the Real America, a Deep State of faceless government workers who are hostile to Trumpian ideas and methods and will just try to obstruct the new administration at every turn if they aren&#39;t dealt with. And what we&#39;re seeing at the NIH and NSF is Dealing With Them, in real time: whacking the organizations hard to terrify everyone involved and making it clear that they are not wanted and should leave. Robert F. Kennedy, the catastrophically awful nominee for HHS Secretary, open told everyone at the NIH to &quot;pack your bags&quot; before the election, and here you see that philosophy in action.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Past that dislike of the government in general, there&#39;s a specific animus towards the NIH and its branches like the CDC after the coronavirus pandemic. That’s a gigantic can of worms that I don’t have the energy to open at the moment, but past &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;, there is a broader hatred of education and expertise of all kinds. I hate to bring that one up, because it makes me sound like a crank, but there really is a strain of Trumpism that is nothing more than a desire for revenge against snooty over-educated elites who try to tell people what they should do based on their so-called &quot;research.&quot; So if by pummelling the NIH and NSF you can simultaneously punch some huge bureaucracies in the face, revenge yourself against your imagined pandemic enemies, and cause distress at a bunch of big universities where they mostly hate you anyway, well. . .what&#39;s not to like? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part Six: What Is To Be Done?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;I don&#39;t want to end there, because I don&#39;t want to make it look like there&#39;s nothing to do but roll over. Never do that. You&#39;ve already seen the judiciary at work here (the restraining order on the funding freeze, with injunctive relief being debate even as I write this blog post). And this is all part of a broader fight that the Trump administration wants to have over impoundment of funds, the idea that the executive branch (specifically, the President) can override Congressional spending allocations simply by refusing to release the money. The Nixon administration already tried this and was slapped down by the Supreme Court, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_and_Impoundment_Control_Act_of_1974&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;specific legislation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has already addressed this idea to emphasize its illegality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The Trump administration has a &quot;Unitary Executive&quot; theory that they love, though, which basically sees the President as the unassailable monarch of the Executive Branch of government and the Executive Branch itself as supreme over Congress and the Judiciary. It is difficult-to-impossible to find any support for this in the law, but I said that about the issue of presidential immunity, too, and look what the Roberts court made of that. But the idea that the President gets to withhold funds at will is (from a legal standpoint) even crazier than that, so we will see. And we certainly will: all this Mighty Executive Power stuff is heading relentlessly to the Supreme Court.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;There&#39;s much more going on that is even more flagrantly lawless, such as the over-the-weekend gutting of USAID by Elon Musk and a few guys barely old enough to grow mustaches. One big answer for now is the courts. Sue, sue constantly, ask for injunctive relief to grind all this bullshit to a halt whenever possible, and then sue some more. Another answer is Congressional oversight. I strongly urge everyone to make their voices heard with their Senators and Representatives about these issues: the Republican ones need to hear that not everyone agrees with this stuff, and the Democratic ones need to hear that their constituents are not in a handshaking bipartisan mood. Point out to them that their own constituents are being hurt by this attack on research funding, and that universities in their own states are going to be hit hard. Keep in mind that much of the general public hasn’t heard about any of this, and they should. We are in a Constitutional crisis whether we like it or not, the worst of my own lifetime by far, and the more voices that are raised against it all, the better. That&#39;s what we can do for now. If it gets worse, it gets worse, and we&#39;ll revisit the topic, God help us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;But most of all, don&#39;t give in to cynicism or apathy. That&#39;s what the people promulgating these horrible policies want - a bored, indifferent public who figures that who cares, nothing matters any more, it&#39;s gonna happen no matter what. But it doesn&#39;t have to. Never forget that: it doesn&#39;t &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to happen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/revised-and-extended-what-s-happening-inside-nih-and-nsf</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/revised-and-extended-what-s-happening-inside-nih-and-nsf</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2025 11:40:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Fresh Asteroid, Getcher Fresh Asteroid Here</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.z94lv18/rss/bennu-1738346758193.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve been waiting to see the results of analyzing the samples of asteroid (101955) Bennu returned by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSIRIS-REx&quot;&gt;OSIRIS-REx&lt;/a&gt; mission, and they&#39;ve just come out. At right is a shot of the probe collecting a sample in 2020; the capsule was returned to Earth in 2023. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02472-9&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s the first paper&lt;/a&gt; on the organic molecules, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08495-6&quot;&gt;here&#39;s a paper&lt;/a&gt; on the water-derived minerals (both are open access). Bennu is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonaceous_chondrite&quot;&gt;carbonaceous chrondrite&lt;/a&gt;, a very interesting class of object (which is why we went to the trouble of visiting it and dragging samples back to Earth!) As the name implies, they are rich in carbon compounds, and meteorites that are recovered here after falls often look like coal or lignite samples. There are numerous subclasses of these, and they show somewhat different chemical compositions whose variations implies different histories (more or less heating, exposure to water, and so on). Some of them are absolutely the most primitive materials known in our solar system; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murchison_meteorite&quot;&gt;Murchison meterorite&lt;/a&gt; (for example) is full of materials that do not appear to have originated in our system at all and were presumably part of the protosolar nebula before our sun even formed. It&#39;s very important to have a sample like this one that has never been contaminated by contact with the Earth&#39;s atmosphere or with terrestrial water; this is &quot;ground truth&quot; if ever there was such.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We already know from those meterorite falls that such carbon-rich asteroids contain a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of different compounds, and the Bennu samples certainly did not disappoint in that department. There are amino acids, heterocycles, polycyclic aromatics, amines, carboxylic acids, all of the DNA and RNA nucleobases - thousands upon thousands of different organic species. The estimate from the mass spectra is about 16,000 different empirical formulae between 100 and 700 Daltons. There are plenty of volatiles in there that are otherwise difficult to assay accurately, ammonia itself being prominent along with formaldehyde and methylamine.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;14 of the 20 &quot;naturally occurring&quot; amino acids are present, with glycine (as you&#39;d expect) as the most abundant. But there are dozens and dozens more noncanonical amino acids in there as well. All the naturally occurring ones seems to show up as racemates within the error bars of detection (there&#39;s a problem with the valine analysis that they&#39;re repeating, looks like). Taken together, this is about as extraterrestrial a sample as you can imagine: the 15N enrichment is far over what you see here on Earth, for starters, and the sheer diversity of compounds is unlike anything you see in samples that have been worked over by the biology of life. It&#39;s interesting to compare the profile seen here with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/162173_Ryugu&quot;&gt;Ryugu&lt;/a&gt; samples (another one brought down from space by the Japanese &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayabusa2&quot;&gt;Hayabusa 2&lt;/a&gt; probe). The Bennu samples are more nitrogen-rich (75x as much ammonia, for example), while the Ryugu ones are more sulfur-rich, although both of them show that weird amount of chemical diversity in their own ways.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The total concentration of amino acids in the Bennu sample is several-fold higher than in the Ryugu material, but is itself several-fold lower than the Murchison meterorite. And the completely racemic character of those amino acids argues in two directions: that there is not some physics-based reason for one enantiomer to be favored over another in the absence of life, and in the other direction, that life on Earth was not seeded by falls of such enantiomerically enriched material to give us the patterns we see today. This is still far from a settled question, but these results are going to be hard to explain away.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What we can infer from the compounds recovered is that Bennu&#39;s parent body seems to have undergone low-temperature aqueous chemistry in an environment where ammonia ice was also stable, as opposed to Ryugu and many other samples. I haven&#39;t spent any time here talking about the mineral-focused paper, but the diversity of evaporite minerals found in the Bennu material lines up completely with this hypothesis. And I&#39;m saying &quot;parent body&quot; because Bennu itself is just a huge pile of rubble that accreted by gravity, apparently from the demolition (by collision, presumably) of some larger parent object or objects. The water is from the protosolar nebula - the solar system (and the universe in general) may look pretty dry from where we sit, but it&#39;s basically soaking in water. And soaking in ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde and pretty much every other simple molecule you can name. The low-temperature part can be inferred by the comparatively high amount of things like isopropylamine in the Ryugu samples as opposed to n-propylamine. The branched-chain compounds are more thermally stable; abundant short unbranched aliphatics indicate that the Bennu material has never undergone a good baking of any kind (and the high levels of volatile compounds of course line up with that as well).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So this is yet more evidence that the molecules of life (and plenty of other molecules that are in the same ballpark) are &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;. Asteroids, comets, interstellar dust clouds, planetary atmospheres and surfaces: every time we attain enough technological ability to collect data from these places we find amino acids, simple carbohydrates, nucleobases, and all the rest of simple organic and bio-organic chemistry. You &lt;em&gt;can&#39;t stop them&lt;/em&gt; from forming: it&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103500963656&quot;&gt;even been shown&lt;/a&gt; that a dilute sample of ammonium cyanide kept at liquid nitrogen temperatures for twenty-five years produces amino acids and purines while just sitting there. If life is uncommon in the universe, it&#39;s not for lack of starting materials - that&#39;s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/fresh-asteroid-getcher-fresh-asteroid-here</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/fresh-asteroid-getcher-fresh-asteroid-here</guid><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:24:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Right There At the Electrode</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve said it before (and I am an odds-on favorite to say it again), but one of the things that impresses me about the state of chemistry in the modern era is that we have some of the tools we need to &lt;em&gt;actually understand what the heck is going on&lt;/em&gt;. By that I mean down at the molecular level, around single molecules, small clusters in solution, near surfaces and interfaces, and so on. It&#39;s hard to overstate just how much of a black box a lot of this has been for most of the history of the science. Take catalytic hydrogenation, which was first discovered in the late 1890s. For most of that time, it has been the next thing to witchcraft: we knew that some catalysts were better (mostly) in some situations over others. Nickel, for example, was considered more likely to completely reduce a nitro group down to an amine for you, while palladium metal had a reputation for stalling out at intermediate stages. But why? And how? What does the surface of (say) a Raney nickel particle look like at the scale of the molecules you&#39;re asking it to reduce, and how does it turn the dihydrogen molecule into such an active reaction partner? These questions are really difficult to answer; you generally need serious instrumentation to make progress.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemistry is still very much in the &lt;em&gt;schwarze Kunst&lt;/em&gt; category for most of us, most of the time. It&#39;s good to see it being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/electrochemistry-lots-electrochemistry&quot;&gt;used more&lt;/a&gt; with the advent of more standardized equipment, but similar questions apply about what&#39;s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; going on at the surfaces of the anodes and cathodes. So I enjoyed &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.4c14420&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;, which takes a detailed look at one of the industrially important electrosynthesis reactions, the conversion of acrylonitrile to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiponitrile&quot;&gt;adiponitrile&lt;/a&gt; (ADN) through a reductive coupling. As I understand it, a good deal of adiponitrile is made via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2010/cc/c0cc01452d#:~:text=Monodentate%20ligands-,The%20DuPont%20adiponitrile%20process,3%2Dbutenenitrile%20(2M3BN).&quot;&gt;DuPont process&lt;/a&gt; from butadiene and HCN, but the Monsanto electrochemical synthesis has its fans, too (the large Ascend plant in Decatur, Alabama is using that route from what I can see, while the INVISTA plant in Shanghai uses a DuPont variation). In case you&#39;re wondering, pretty much all that adiponitrile, no matter how it&#39;s made, gets reduced down to the diamine and then turned into &quot;PA 6.6&quot;, where the PA stands for &quot;polyamide&quot; and the common trade name for the resulting material is Nylon.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The authors do a lot of &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; IR and EPR work to get the details. It was already known (by sheer experimentation) that the process was much cleaner and higher-yielding when you used tetrabutylammonium salts as the electrolyte in the aqueous reaction mixture. Without it, there&#39;s a tendency for trouble after the first stage of the reaction: that&#39;s the reduction and protonation of the acrylonitrile to give you a propionitrile free radical, but that one can get reduced and protonated &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; if you don&#39;t watch out, giving you plain propionitrile (a much less profitable direction for things to take). What you want that first radical to do is homocouple to another one to give you ADN, but it can also go on to react with more acrylonitrile to form some oligomeric products that you don&#39;t want, either.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The analytical work here (performed in a custom-built electrochemical flow cell, which took some doing) confirms one of the hypotheses about how the tetrabutylammonium salt helps to fix these problems. It turns out that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_layer_(surface_science)&quot;&gt;electrical double layer&lt;/a&gt; down at the cathode is crowded with tetralkylammonium cations, which make for a very localized greasy landscape that tends to expel water molecules while attracting acrylonitrile. Getting rid of the water suppresses the hydrogen evolution that otherwise could be taking place down there, which is another big advantage (oxygen does get produced over at the anode, though). It appears that the bulk of the radical couplings to make the ADN product occur out in the bulk solution, though. Meanwhile, isotope studies using deuterium oxide as solvent indicated that the proton transfer that&#39;s needed for that propionitrile side reaction is actually a rate-limiting step, which doesn&#39;t seem to be the case in the desired reaction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, that explains the empirical optimization that the reaction has undergone over the years: add a tetrabutylammonium electrolyte (and not a tetramethyl one, which is less efficacious), and keep things at a high pH to suppress the proton transfer step that leads to undesired propionitrile. These lessons may well be applicable to other free-radical electrosynthetic processes, and it&#39;s worth remembering that this one couldn&#39;t really compete with the traditional chemical routes until the recipe was improved in this way. It would be better to know where to start looking among all the possibilities and why, rather than just trying things until stuff improves (as time-honored a technique as that is). Because, you know, they don&#39;t always improve before your time, money, and patience run out!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/right-there-electrode</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/right-there-electrode</guid><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 09:35:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Annoying Enzyme Activity</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Chemical biology&quot; is a bit of a nebulous term, but for me, one of the things that lands squarely in any reasonable definition of it is the idea of conjugating synthetic molecules to biomolecules in order to make a species that shows activities that neither would show on their own. Antibody-drug conjugates are one of the classic examples, where you use an antibody to direct the localization of what is often (but doesn&#39;t have to be) some nasty warhead compound designed for chemotherapy. You also see this idea used with smaller ligands short of outright antibodies, just as long as they&#39;re selective enough and have good enough pharmacokinetics. The bifunctional protein degraders are an intracellular example of this, with one end binding a target protein and the other end binding to some part of the protein degradation machinery. In the last few years, a great many examples have been published of bifunctionals that aren&#39;t aimed at degradation at all, but rather cause unusual phosphorylation or dephosphorylation, acetylation, and more. The possibilities are actively being explored as I write this post and as you&#39;re reading it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This means that we&#39;re throwing a lot of pretty odd-looking molecules into cell and animal assays (and eventually into human patients), and you never know quite what to expect in &lt;em&gt;terra incognita&lt;/em&gt;. These conjugates are often rather hefty (molecular-weight-wise) and can have unusual polarity if one end of a bifunctional is significantly different in logD, hydrogen bonding groups, etc. People are working to get a handle on these effects, but for now the best advice if you have some funky-looking active bioconjugate or multimer is &quot;dose it and see&quot;. Sometimes you&#39;re pleasantly surprised at the uptake and stability, and sometimes not so pleasantly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.4c00432&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; points out an unexpected source of those downside surprises when you conjugate something to fatty acid groups via an amide bond. The authors find that many such compounds associate with the cell membrane (no particular surprise there) and are then cleaved by the enzyme activity of the protein complex known as gamma-secretase. Now that second part was not anticipated. Gamma-secretase&#39;s fame is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s12276-022-00754-8&quot;&gt;being part of&lt;/a&gt; the amyloid-processing pathway that generates the infamous 1-42 beta-amyloid that is so well known from Alzheimer&#39;s studies. Indeed, an earlier approach to AD therapy was to look for inhibitors of the enzyme activity, but these came to grief: they had no real beneficial effects in Alzheimer&#39;s patients, and they showed side effects from inhibition of gamma-secretase&#39;s long list of other functions, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notch_proteins&quot;&gt;Notch signaling&lt;/a&gt; probably at the top of the list. Actually, &quot;no beneficial effects&quot; is putting it too lightly, because one of the most promising drug candidates in this class (Lilly&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semagacestat&quot;&gt;semagacestat&lt;/a&gt;) actually made patients &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; as compared to placebo. Interestingly, that Notch-inhibiting activity has been converted from a bug into a feature by the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8018325/&quot;&gt;using such inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; in oncology, and some promising results &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2210140&quot;&gt;were reported&lt;/a&gt; last year using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirogacestat&quot;&gt;nirogacestat&lt;/a&gt; in rare-but-aggressive desmoid tumors.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But I don&#39;t think any of us suspected that it was in there cleaving our artificial fatty acid amides. Gamma-secretase (to my knowledge) is known for cleaving membrane-bound proteins inside their transmembrane regions, and that&#39;s presumably how it manages this feat as well. The long lipid chain of the conjugate molecules presumably fits into the membrane, exposing the amide part to the secretase&#39;s activity. By making a series of palmitic acid amides, the athors showed that a whole range of substrates are cleaved this way, including conjugates of small molecules, fluorescent dyes, and so on (and it&#39;s not just with palmitic acid derivatives, either). But amide conjugates that don&#39;t incorporate a membrane-localizing lipid tail seem to be safe - other things can and do happen to those, but it isn&#39;t gamma secretase&#39;s fault in those cases.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So anyone making compounds with such a lipid attachment might want to thing about this work. For the most part, we don&#39;t have lots of extra half-life and exposure to be giving away, and there seems to be no reason to attract this secretase cleavage activity if there&#39;s an alternative. That&#39;s annoying, because such amide linkages are just about the easiest, quickest, most high-yielding and most often successful couplings you can use. But nothing is handed to us for free.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/annoying-enzyme-activity</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/annoying-enzyme-activity</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2025 02:31:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Bacteria (and Their Metabolites) and Depression</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Now here&#39;s some natural products work whose direction I didn&#39;t see coming: the bacterium &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morganella_morganii&quot;&gt;Morganella morganii&lt;/a&gt; is considered to be a common part of the gut microbiome and an opportunistic pathogen in conditions like IBD and urinary tract infections. But in the (large and difficult) task of figuring out what the connections might be to that microbiome and human health (and human disease), &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; had an unusual turn in the spotlight a couple of years back. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00991-z&quot;&gt;This paper&lt;/a&gt; identified it as having a possible causal role in major depressive disorder, which is the sort of result that will first make you wonder if something has gone wrong in your analysis. But it was one of the strongest causal signals in the team&#39;s GWAS analysis (&lt;span&gt;2,801 microbial taxa and 7,967,866 human genetic variants from 5,959 individuals), and it was the only one that validated (&lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; levels versus major depression) when they went back and checked multi-year health records taken after the original microbiota samples.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; there&#39;s no reason to expect that a single bacterial species might be such a cause, and you immediately have to ask what a possible mechanism might be. Here&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.4c15158&quot;&gt;a new paper&lt;/a&gt; that takes a first step in that direction. The authors note that the bacterium also shows some association with other inflammatory-cascade conditions (the aforementioned IBD as well as type II diabetes), and went looking for unusual bacterial products that might tie in to such responses (there have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04396-8&quot;&gt;other such things&lt;/a&gt; proposed in the recent past). They found some odd ones: molecules that look a lot like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiolipin&quot;&gt;cardiolipins&lt;/a&gt;, which are lipid species found in many bacteria and in the inner membrane of mitochondria. That particular abundance is one of the lines of evidence that points to the bacterial origin of mitochondria themselves, actually.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But cardiolipins have a diphosphotidalglycerol structure common to all members of the family, whereas these new species have a diethanolamine in the middle of their structures rather than a glycerol. That gives them very similar structures to the real cardiolipins while making them distinctively different species - in fact, if you were faced as a medicinal chemist with making unnatural cardiolipin analogs (which would be no fun, believe me), this is quite possibly one of the things you&#39;d make just to see what happens. Where is this diethanolamine coming from? Well, it&#39;s not known to be a natural part of either human or bacterial biochemistry. Instead, it is an industrial contaminant, sadly, whose ability to be incorporated (at low levels) into animal and human lipids through the apparently-not-so-picky enzyme &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidate_cytidylyltransferase&quot;&gt;cardiolipin synthase&lt;/a&gt; has been confirmed for decades now. Knowing what these unnatural lipids do, though, that&#39;s another matter.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These particular weirdo lipids, it turns out, are rather strongly pro-inflammatory and act as TLR ligands to release IL-6. That makes the tale even more interesting, because IL-6 levels have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159121000842&quot;&gt;independently&lt;/a&gt; been seen as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.810302/full&quot;&gt;connected&lt;/a&gt; to major depression. So taken together, there would seem to be good reason to continue to continue to unravel the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6658985/&quot;&gt;long-hypothesized&lt;/a&gt; inflammation/depression &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627320304311&quot;&gt;connection&lt;/a&gt;, and particularly in regards to possible exacerbating factors such as higher levels of &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; infection or even higher environmental exposure to diethanolamine. We seem to have a lot to learn here!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/bacteria-and-their-metabolites-and-depression</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/bacteria-and-their-metabolites-and-depression</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 01:17:51 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Some Good MASH/NASH News For Once</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The disease formerly known as NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/mash&quot;&gt;recently renamed&lt;/a&gt; in the medical literature to the more descriptive MASH (metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis). In its advanced stages, this is what&#39;s commonly referred to as cirrhosis of the liver, and in its earlier stages is often called &quot;fatty liver disease&quot;. There are a number of other fatty-liver conditions that can come under that title, with various causes, but I think it&#39;s safe to say that the most widespread is indeed the standard metabolism-associated one. Decades ago you would encounter this more in the context of late-stage alcoholism, thus the earlier nomenclature to try to differentiate things, but now it&#39;s more likely to be seen along with obesity and other metabolic-associated problems (dyslipedemia, high blood pressure, type II diabetes and so on).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you call it, it&#39;s bad news. You only have one liver, and although its powers of regeneration are impressive indeed, you can do enough damage to it so that it cannot maintain its many functions that are absolutely crucial to remaining alive (thus the organ&#39;s common name, of course - ancient cultures and their physicians noted that (unlike, say, the spleen) it was an organ that could not be severely damaged without killing the person involved). Through the course of MASH you see the fat deposits that are the hallmark of trouble, followed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis&quot;&gt;fibrosis&lt;/a&gt;, which is a general tissue response to severe stress (physical damage, constant inflammation, etc.) that ends up making large swaths of it largely useless. When fibrotic damage accumulates to the point that blood flow through the liver itself (which is crucial to its functions) is impaired, then it&#39;s termed cirrhosis, and that is characterized as &quot;end-stage&quot; liver disease for grim and completely accurate reasons.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In times past, what happened then was you died, often after turning the jaundiced shades of yellow that are the hallmark of being unable to clear the constant stream of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin&quot;&gt;bilirubin&lt;/a&gt; waste any longer. In more recent decades you probably die anyway, but if you&#39;re very fortunate indeed you might receive a liver transplant, which is the only thing that can help at that point. Catching the disease at an earlier stage is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-treatment-patients-liver-scarring-due-fatty-liver-disease&quot;&gt;just starting&lt;/a&gt; to give you some other options. Some other late-stage strategies other than hoping for a fresh liver or getting your affairs in order would obviously be extremely welcome, and many, many biopharma companies have taken shots at the disease over the years. All of which, sadly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(20)30680-6/fulltext&quot;&gt;have failed&lt;/a&gt;, but there are always &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10524415/&quot;&gt;more ideas&lt;/a&gt; where those came from. Those clinical failures have of course been expensive and painful, but they have also helped clear up a number of mistakenly hopeful theories about MASH in general, which is just how medical science is supposed to work.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One of the best candidates recently has been a hormone called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor_21&quot;&gt;FGF21&lt;/a&gt;, which has a number of metabolic functions. A big one is the regulation of sugar uptake in adipocytes, and it has many liver-related roles as well. Levels of it are notably elevated in MASH patients, and a mutation in the corresponding gene is known to produce a &quot;sweet tooth syndrome&quot; in both humans and mice. (I might suggest that the author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/25/magazine/quit-sugar.html&quot;&gt;this recent &lt;em&gt;New York Times Magazine&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt; is polymorphic at that locus, although I don&#39;t know if she&#39;s interested in knowing that or not!) There are three different FGF21 receptor types, which makes the response landscape rather complex, and for that reason I think it&#39;s a good thing that there have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/boston-hits-phase-2-mash-goal-positioning-monthly-prospect-follow-akero-89bio-pivotal&quot;&gt;several analogs&lt;/a&gt; of the hormone (with different pharmacokinetic and receptor-binding profiles) entering clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One of these (exfruxifermin) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/27/akero-efruxifermin-liver-fibrosis-mash/&quot;&gt;just produced&lt;/a&gt; some extremely interesting clinical results. Akero Therapeutics reported 96-week data this morning in its trial of advanced MASH patients, and there seem really significant signs of improvement compared to placebo. In fact, some patients actually showed &lt;em&gt;reversal&lt;/em&gt; of cirrhotic damage, which I am pretty sure has to be a first. (This is one of those grim cases where a placebo-controlled trial is warranted versus a standard-of-care one, because there &lt;em&gt;is no&lt;/em&gt; standard of care by that point). Akero had reported 36-week data back in October of 2023, and those results actually were much less than observers were hoping for: the improvements at that point had not reached statistical significance, so their stock got pummeled, and investors started &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/06/17/2899964/0/en/Akero-Therapeutics-Inc-Investors-Class-action-lawsuit-filed-on-behalf-of-investors-the-Portnoy-Law-Firm.html&quot;&gt;lining up&lt;/a&gt; to sue the company&#39;s management).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But congratulations to Akero for staying the course, and for having raised enough money to stay that course (don&#39;t forget that part!) It now looks like FGF21 is indeed a solid mechanism for fatty liver disease therapy, even if it acts more slowly than expected. We can expect a number of other trial results from both Akero and their competitors (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.89bio.com/&quot;&gt;89bio&lt;/a&gt;) in the coming months - there are studies going on in different stages and presentations of the disease, in patients with and without simultaneous GLP-1 therapy, etc. After so many years of failure in this area, it is just great to see something succeed!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/some-good-mash-nash-news-once</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/some-good-mash-nash-news-once</guid><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 01:04:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Attacking Estrogen-Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: this post is a two-parter, in a way.

Those who have worked on new oncology drugs and targets well know that the proof of this field is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; in human patients - there have been many, many compounds with activity in mouse models (specifically mouse xenografts, where tissue is implanted into immune-compromised rodents) where that activity has not been as impressive in human clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But still. The compound under discussion would appear to have some &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; activity to burn and still be of great interest. It&#39;s part of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abf1383&quot;&gt;series of compounds&lt;/a&gt; reported by this team from Illinois (Champaign-Urbana), and I blogged about that initial 2021 paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/new-pathway-kill-resistant-breast-cancer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. As mentioned there, one of the mechanisms at work is stimulation of the &quot;unfolded protein response&quot; pathway, and another is dysregulation of intracellular cation concentrations through binding to the ion channel &lt;a href=&quot;https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/trpm4/#:~:text=The%20TRPM4%20gene%20provides%20instructions,into%20and%20out%20of%20cells.&quot;&gt;TRPM4&lt;/a&gt;. That part of the mechanism was not known at the time of the 2021 paper, but became apparent on further study. These pathways seem to lead to rapid cell death in estrogen-receptor-alpha driven tumor cell lines, and the papers so far have shown some impressive activity in both these cell lines and in preliminary animal models.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.zbm8dk9/rss/erso-1737743808687.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;But the compounds to date could not be dosed at higher concentrations i.v., and the team has been working on better-tolerated analogs. Their latest (denoted ErSO-TFPy) is shown at right. The tetrafluoropyrrolidine abbreviated in that name seems to do a great deal for the compound&#39;s properties (fluorine can indeed be magical), and this analog has nanomolar IC50 activities in a whole range of ER-alpha breast cancer cell lines. And unlike the previous compounds, this one has a maximum tolerated iv dose of 150 mg/kg in mice (a mighty bolus, I would say) and at least 50 mpk in rats and 5 mpk in dogs (they didn&#39;t push it higher in either case). At a 15 mg/kg dose in rodents it holds blood levels well above the cellular IC50 values for at least 8 hours, which is good to see.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What does it do at these doses? Well, comparing it in cells to a number of selective estrogen receptor degraders showed that all of the latter class took several days to reach what were basically cytostatic effects. But ErSO-TFPy is outright cytotoxic to these tumor lines (while not to normal cells) within 24 hours. Moving on to mouse models, MCF-7 xenograft mice showed significant tumor growth inhibition at a 5 mg/kg weekly iv dose, and outright tumor regression at 10 mpk. In a drug-resistant patient-derived xenograft model (a very challenging test) tumor regressions were seen in 8 out of 18 mice, with no other chemotherapy agents showing activity at all under these conditions (twice a week dosing for four weeks).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Given the activity at these relatively low doses, the team pushed up the doses to 25 and 50 mg/kg. These showed very strong effects &lt;em&gt;after a single dose of the drug&lt;/em&gt;, with five out of five mice in the latter group showing no signs of tumor tissue even after two months of observation. Even exceptionally large tumors showed greater than 90% regression response after single doses of ErSO-TFPy at these levels, which is very striking (in fact, to my knowledge, basically unheard of). That&#39;s what I mean by having &quot;&lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; activity to burn&quot;. Similar results were obtained with other xenograft lines. Necropsy time-course results suggest rapid destruction of the tumor tissue, with the rate-limiting step likely being removal of the necrotic tissue by macrophages after the damage is done. The only other cancer therapy that I know of where you had to worry about cell death being too rapid was in the initial human studies of CAR-T therapy, which nearly sent the first patient into kidney failure as his system tried to clear a huge mass of cellular debris all at once. This is a rare problem to have!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I agree with the authors here: such a compound could potentially have a great effect in human clinical practice, and I think studies in that direction should be moving now. Let&#39;s see if this really works in our species (or if other limiting problems come up when we try). The only way to be sure about either of those is to dose people, so let&#39;s do it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A note that I feel that I have to add:&lt;/strong&gt; a great deal of this work has been funded (as you can see from the end of manuscript) by NIH grants, and NCI money is involved as well. These agencies, along with all other federal health agencies, are currently under a communication ban imposed by the new administration, so you&#39;re not going to see any press releases from either of them just yet. Even more to the point is that the administration has (in the last few days) cancelled all NIH &quot;study sessions&quot; where grant applications and renewals are evaluated. These things happen on defined cycles, and if this round really has been arbitrarily dismissed without any recourse, it means that many labs will outright lose their funding and will have to stop their work and start dismissing people entirely. And just today comes work from people inside the NIH that &lt;em&gt;all purchasing&lt;/em&gt; (equipment, lab supplies) has now been put on indefinite hold. What the hell?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This screeching-halt effect will be felt for years to come, and the whole thing seems like a pointless and callous attack on one of country&#39;s great strengths, which is our world-renowned ability in basic research. I do not understand at all what the Trump administration is trying to accomplish here, outside of dropping a brick on an extremely useful federal agency and its clients. If you want an example of what NIH funding can accomplish, something that is easy to understand, then try this one: research towards a compound that appears to clear breast cancer tumors out in a single dose. Who in the Trump administration will tell me why this sort of thing has to stop?&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/attacking-estrogen-receptor-positive-breast-cancer</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/attacking-estrogen-receptor-positive-breast-cancer</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 12:42:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Killing Cancer Patients (Once the Payments Clear)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I was horrified by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/business/exthera-cancer-blood-filtering-device.html&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; from John Carryerou (the reporter who broke the Theranos story). It&#39;s another shady-medical-device story, but this one, for better or worse, is not as off-the-charts crazy as Theranos. But it has more actionable lessons, I think. The Theranos scandal had takeaways like &quot;Consider the possibility that the charismatic young founder of this hot company might have been lying about absolutely everything from Day One, over and over in every possible media venue&quot;. And that&#39;s worth taking on board, God knows, but it&#39;s not something that happens quite that egregiously quite that often.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This new story is about a company called ExThera, and the first thing to know is that they actually have a real medical device that actually seems to work, and which has been used in hundreds of patients. It&#39;s a blood filter consisting of tiny heparin-coated beads, and you use it on a dialysis setup, returning a patient&#39;s blood continuously after filtration. The idea is that the huge heparin-coated surface area retains pathogens (viral particles, for example) and that the circulating titer of these can be substantially reduced by such treatment. The EU approved the device (the Seraph 100 Microbind Affinity blood filter) in 2019 for severe bloodstream infections, and when the pandemic hit the next year it was shown to work against the coronavirus - the FDA has approved the device on an emergency basis for patients who are about to go into respiratory failure.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. The company, naturally enough, has been trying to see just how far this idea can go, and has been pursuing the hypothesis that the Seraph device might be able to filter out circulating tumor cells. These are the ones that have broken loose from an original cancer mass (often through mutations in their surface adhesion protein pathways) and wander off to start metastatic disease in distant organs. Attempted to clear these out seems like a worthy investigation, and indeed the FDA allowed ExThera to try the device on five patients in Oklahoma as a preliminary study.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Well, so far, so good there, too. But here&#39;s where things go off the rails, terribly. As Carreyrou details, ExThera&#39;s then-Chief Medical Officer (Sanja Ilic) met a Croatian doctor who wanted to try this idea out in a dozen patients. This work &lt;a href=&quot;https://karger.com/bpu/article/doi/10.1159/000542325/915514/First-In-Human-Rapid-Removal-of-Circulating-Tumor&quot;&gt;has been published&lt;/a&gt;, in a paper that is very light on details and certainly contains no dramatic stories of any cures, but it supposedly gave all kinds of positive results. They were positive enough that a member of the company&#39;s board (John Preston) pitched them to a billionaire investor of his acquaintance (Alan Quasha) who put up money to start up a clinic in Antigua. Why Antigua? Well, how about utter lack of any regulatory oversight? Speeds things up, you know. Move fast and break things, amIright?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Problem is, in biomedicine some of the things you break are human beings. ExThera ended up selling thousands of the blood filters to the billionaire&#39;s private equity firm (Quadrant Management, and its new brand Quadrant Clinical Care), and collecting large usage fees from them, and Quadrant began charging desperate cancer patients and their families $45,000 a pop to fly down to the Caribbean for a miracle cure. Well, that&#39;s per single course of treatment, let&#39;s be clear. Patients were encouraged to go through multiple rounds of filtration, naturally. Quadrant&#39;s clinic also urged its customers to stop taking their chemotherapy drugs, for reasons that are not clear to me, except for perhaps malevolent incompetence. Carreyrou has obtained recordings of Preston and Ilic telling potential customers about previous patients who experienced remarkable turnarounds, and that seems to have fetched a steady stream of applicants.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What they found in Antigua was. . .well, sadly, about what you might have expected:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt; 
 &lt;p class=&quot;css-at9mc1 evys1bk0&quot; style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The clinic Quadrant had hired lacked modern medical equipment, and the doctor in charge, a surgeon named Joey John, was making incisions under some patients’ collarbones to install dialysis catheters without using any medical imaging or sufficient anesthesia, according to two people familiar with what the ExThera team encountered. Dr. Chow (ExThera&#39;s Chief Medical Officer) witnessed patients bleeding profusely and, in one case, screaming in pain. He was also alarmed to learn that a patient was forgoing chemotherapy, a pillar of cancer care, for an experimental treatment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p class=&quot;css-at9mc1 evys1bk0&quot; style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ExThera had flown in Sarah Mobbs, a nurse who had experience treating Covid patients with the filter, to help administer the therapy. Company officials had told Ms. Mobbs that she would be assisting with a cancer study. But when she arrived at Dr. John’s clinic, she saw no signs of the guardrails that would normally accompany a clinical trial, three people with knowledge of the matter said. There was no treatment plan, no oversight from a medical board to ensure the supposed study was conducted safely and ethically. There wasn’t even an oncologist on site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p class=&quot;css-at9mc1 evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Dr. Chow, to his credit, warned the company that this operation was unethical and unsafe and urged them to shut it down. Both Ilic and Preston apparently have no further connection with ExThera. But Quadrant Clinical Care? They&#39;re still taking in patients and still processing their payments. After all, they bought a lot of blood filters - and at a cost of about a thousand dollars each, with revenues of $45,000 per round of treatment, why would they stop? The article goes into great and excruciating detail about the treatment of one patient in particular (David Hudlow) who was put through conditions that would appear to have further shortened his already-shortened lifespan and put him (and his wife) through a tremendous amount of needless suffering before he died. I have no reason to think that the article&#39;s descriptions of these are inaccurate, and if they are indeed as described they amount to multiple types of malpractice along with a callous and reckless disregard for human life and human dignity.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p class=&quot;css-at9mc1 evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This sort of thing is the exact opposite of the medical goal of &lt;em&gt;primum non nocere&lt;/em&gt; (first do no harm). Quadrant&#39;s clinicians seem to have not worried for a moment about the obvious and severe harm that they were causing their patients just so long as the payments (which were due up front) came in. And here, folks, is where we talk about the Regulatory State, which is an entity that is much in the news thanks to recent political developments.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p class=&quot;css-at9mc1 evys1bk0&quot;&gt;There has long been a romanticized vision floating around of what medical progress would be like if only the bureaucrats and paper-pushers would get out of the way. There is talk of an &quot;invisible graveyard&quot; of patients who died before the slow, painful process of regulated medical research could get around to helping them. And you know what? They&#39;re right - up to a point. If you just look at the successful treatments, then yes, you can say that If Only We&#39;d Sped That One Up we would have saved more lives. But too many of the Invisible Graveyard people don&#39;t do the full bookkeeping on all the stuff that doesn&#39;t work (or worse, makes people worse). The clinical trial system contains those failures and isolates them from the general population of patients, while at the same time providing real evidence for their failure and thus solid reasons to go away and try something else.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p class=&quot;css-at9mc1 evys1bk0&quot;&gt;If you kick out the jams and let Anyone Try Anything, what you get is the Quadrant Clinical Care facility in Antigua. Hell, that&#39;s actually &lt;em&gt;a best case&lt;/em&gt;. The rationale behind this one (as mentioned) might work, and is definitely worth further study. But depleting desperate people of their savings to treat an endless stream of random patients is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; &quot;further study&quot;. No one at the Antigua facility seems to have the faintest understanding of how you generate reliable clinical data, and no one there appears to give a damn that they don&#39;t. Because that&#39;s not the point of the place. This is a private equity investment from people who know nothing at all about medical practice, and its point is to &lt;em&gt;make cash now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p class=&quot;css-at9mc1 evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve said this before, and I&#39;m saying it again: if you destroy the horrible bureaucratic regulatory state out of your libertarian convictions, out of lack of understanding, out of spite and revenge, this is what you get. &lt;em&gt;At best&lt;/em&gt; this is what you get. Past the ExTheras and Quadrants of the world are a horde of predators who don&#39;t even care as much as they did. Turn them loose, and they will do what they do, because (sadly) that&#39;s what many people are like. &lt;em&gt;Homo homoni lupus&lt;/em&gt;: man is a wolf to man, and the point of laws and regulations is to keep the wolves at bay. Will we?&lt;/p&gt;

It includes several efforts that I hadn&#39;t been paying attention to at all, so it was definitely worth a look.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In that latter category are things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06153966?term=prion%20disease&amp;amp;rank=5&quot;&gt;ION-717&lt;/a&gt;, an antisense therapy that is attempting to lower the levels of prion protein expression in diseases like Creutzfeld-Jacob. The first results are going to be mostly pharmacokinetics and safety, but this is certainly of interest because as as far as I&#39;m aware there is nothing at all that can be currently be done for prion-driven neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05701657&quot;&gt;rather large nutrition trial&lt;/a&gt; is going to try to bring some more order to what has always been a chaotic field. They&#39;re studying 8000 diverse patients in two-week panels of defined diets to try to untangle how different patients respond differently to varying proportions of carbohydrates, fat, protein, etc., as well as looking for signals from the degree of processing of the foods involved, amounts of fiber, fruits and vegetables versus meat sources, and so on. It&#39;s a big area to cover, and I wish them luck. I hope it doesn&#39;t end up just confusing us more!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Among ones that I&#39;ve been looking forward to as well is &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05456880&quot;&gt;Beam&#39;s look&lt;/a&gt; at single-base DNA editing in hematopoetic stem cells for sickle cell disease, but as you&#39;ll see from &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.beamtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beam-therapeutics-announces-progress-hematology-and-genetic&quot;&gt;this press release&lt;/a&gt;, they have &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.beamtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beam-therapeutics-announces-progress-hematology-and-genetic&quot;&gt;several other readouts&lt;/a&gt; coming this year as well (in glycogen storage disease and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency). As many will be aware, there was a patient death in the sickle cell trial, but this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/beam-sickle-cell-base-editing-study-data-abstract/731931/&quot;&gt;has been evaluated&lt;/a&gt; as due to the chemotherapy used to prepare the bone marrow for transplant, not to anything associated with the edited cells themselves.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/biotech-pharma-clinical-trials-watch-2025/736120/&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; lists several more high-profile trials that are on the way to reading out as well. There are a number of big efforts in the GLP-1 field, naturally, and that area is going to be a high-stakes battle for some time to come. This year we should see some results from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000205079&quot;&gt;an ambitious effort&lt;/a&gt; by Novo Nordisk to see if semaglutide can slow the progression of Alzheimer&#39;s, for example. But I&#39;m also very interested in Arvinas getting Phase III data on their estrogen receptor degrader &lt;span&gt;vepdegestrant (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11325148/&quot;&gt;ARV-471&lt;/a&gt;), a key test for targeted protein degradation and Vera&#39;s fusion protein (atacicept) for IgA nephropathy - the Phase II for that one looked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538%2824%2900236-9/fulltext&quot;&gt;very impressive&lt;/a&gt;, and the next readout is from a Phase 3. We&#39;re also going to hear &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/update-human-crispr&quot;&gt;more from Verve&lt;/a&gt; and their human-CRISPR PCSK9 therapy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That&#39;s only the beginning - there&#39;s a lot of really innovative and nervy stuff going on in the industry right now, and I hope for the best. Waiting for data like this is one of the most nerve-wracking parts of the whole business!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/clinical-trial-readouts-are-comin</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/clinical-trial-readouts-are-comin</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 01:08:51 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Current Environment</title><description>&lt;p&gt;After yesterday&#39;s presidential inauguration here in the US, I found it difficult to sit down and cover one of the topics that I had queued up for a blog post today, so I think it might be useful to get a couple of things off my chest before returning to those. I&#39;ll try not to go on too long - in fact, not going on too long will be part of the point.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/choice&quot;&gt;opinions&lt;/a&gt; around President &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/politics-unfortunately&quot;&gt;Trump&lt;/a&gt; and the makeup of his new administration have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/choice-made&quot;&gt;not changed&lt;/a&gt; (unless they have grown even more despairingly hostile, which I can&#39;t rule out). I have not warmed up to the man, to his behavior, or to his oft-stated positions, nor can I really say that I have even reached a state of equilibrium yet about any of these. I hope to, but such a state should not be confused with any sort of acceptance. Rather, I&#39;m trying to reach a &lt;em&gt;modus vivendi&lt;/em&gt; around the Trump administration that will allow me to preserve my physical and mental health during it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Which isn&#39;t easy. I am vigorously opposed to many of the new administration&#39;s key proposals, and I am often disgusted by their presentation and the rhetoric surrounding them. Trust me, I could go on for ten thousand words about all of this, right now, page after page of invective. I am actively resisting that temptation, because it will do no good for anyone else and it will actively do me harm. I don&#39;t mean to my reputation or anything like that - I mean actual physical harm as the stress hormones dump into my blood, as my heart rate increases and my fists clench up. Anyone who reads this site already knows how I feel about Trump and his minions - this post today will just lay down another marker for 2025. Make no mistake: I think we are likely headed into the most disastrous presidential term in American history, and furthermore the fact that things have gotten this far means that our politics and our very society are displaying serious symptoms of fundamental trouble.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But inveighing against all this day after day is not the answer. I&#39;m saving my energies to fight on battlegrounds of my choosing. For example, I would urge everyone (even and especially those people in states with Republican senators) to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm&quot;&gt;contact theirs&lt;/a&gt; to voice their displeasure with the administration&#39;s cabinet nominees, many of whom are historically, catastrophically bad, to the point of being indistinguishable from direct insults. As to the usual subject of this blog, the nominees for major health, biomedical, and scientific positions range from &quot;Not reassuring&quot; down to &quot;nightmarish&quot;. One of the techniques that aspiring autocrats use is to cultivate an aura of huge support and inevitability, to make it seem as if resisting their ideas is like resisting a hurricane or something. I recommend puncturing this whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So if there&#39;s some political outrage going on - and God knows there are already, and there will be many, many more - and you come to this site and I&#39;m not writing about it, don&#39;t take that as a sign of acquiescence or despair. I&#39;m not giving in to either, but I&#39;m pacing myself as well. Let me fire off one last quote in the high style, and then tomorrow we get back to science, which I hope will help to keep all of us sane. From Alexsandr Solzhenitsyn&#39;s Nobel lecture: &lt;em&gt;&quot;The simple act of an ordinary brave man is not to participate in lies, not to support false actions. His rule should be: let the lie come into the world, let it even triumph - but not through me.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/current-environment</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/current-environment</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 12:52:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Snake Antivenoms, Computed</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08393-x&quot;&gt;really interesting paper&lt;/a&gt; from the Baker lab at Washington and co-workers on a very real-world problem where machine learning looks to be able to help. Now, I realize that statement might make a few readers raise their eyebrows, because over the last few years I have developed a reputation as an AI/ML skeptic. And I&#39;d say that&#39;s true, although given the hype that envelopes the field, almost anyone who isn&#39;t running around flapping their arms and emitting ecstatic bird-like shrieks comes across as a skeptic (!) These things are relative, y&#39;know.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&#39;m not is an across-the-board reflexive skeptic. There are indeed current applications for these technologies (as opposed to those in the great and glorious future coming Real Soon Now), and in the biology/chemistry territory one of those applications is clearly protein design and structure. It&#39;s a perfect fit for machine learning approaches (as witness the success of the tools we now have for protein structure prediction), and although it&#39;s not the Infalliable Machine Oracle - nothing is - it&#39;s still very valuable. This new paper, on designing proteins to neutralize various three-finger motif snake venoms, can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adk1867&quot;&gt;compared to one&lt;/a&gt; I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/antibodies-everywhere&quot;&gt;blogged about&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago from an antibody design group at Scripps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&#39;re going after the same targets (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-finger_toxin&quot;&gt;three-finger toxins&lt;/a&gt;), and for good reason. Snakebites kill or disable hundreds of thousands of people a year, although if you live in (say) London or New York you probably don&#39;t have that problem very high on your list. It&#39;s sure not on mine out here in eastern Massachusetts; my entire state can barely round up a few fugitive rattlesnakes and copperheads, and it&#39;s a real event if you see one in the wild. Not that I blame the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;&gt;poisonous&lt;/span&gt; venemous snakes - it gets pretty damned cold around here, and we are bereft of any lizard species for the same reason. But if you live in warmer climates, the story is different, and if you live in the tropics, the story can get very different indeed. There are some flamboyantly venemous species out there, some of which are ill-tempered and prone to fang first and ask questions later, and if you&#39;re on the receiving end of such a bite your prospects are iffy without antivenom treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a constant overall shortage of such antivenoms, and the the ones for three-finger-toxin venoms also suffer from high costs and cold-chain handling problems. It would be a great improvement if more stable treatments could be manufactured at scale and distributed for later use, and that&#39;s the goal of these different protein design efforts. The new paper linked above found that modeling via the RFdiffusion method provided very potent de novo protein sequences that bind tightly (nanomolar affinity and below) to the three-finger motifs of snake neurotoxins, and they found them rather quickly (after just a few dozen analogs). They also show a designed protein against a consensus cytotoxin sequence - that one&#39;s about 270 nM, which needs to be better, but it has a very unusual binding structure without a hydrophobic core holding it together (not the sort of thing you&#39;d go after, otherwise). All of these appear to be quite thermostable, and their X-ray structures bound to their targets were in solid agreement with prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments in mice showed that the anti-neurotoxin candidates did indeed protect mice from lethal challenges of their protein partners, both when given simultaneously or when given fifteen minutes after toxin injection. These were in tenfold excess to the toxin dose, and given the rather low volumes that snakes deliver that seems doable for human therapy. The mice themselves showed no acute ill effects during or after the treatments, but if these get moved on towards humans the usual warnings for protein therapies apply: you&#39;ll have to make sure that you don&#39;t set off unwanted immune responses to the drugs themselves, as well as looking at metabolic stability and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing this work to the Scripps antibody paper mentioned earlier shows a lot of similarities. The antibodies might have well have the edge in wider range, since they were deliberately chosen to be cross-reactive against several toxins. But as the Scripps group noted, their starting library contained about 60 billion antibodies, and they only found 16 that bound to all their candidate toxins (they then engineered that down to their best candidate). The diffusion team from the Baker group would seem to have an advantage in producing potent binders more or less from thin air, but on the ever-present other hand, using the natural antibody scaffold should give you a definite leg up on having developable properties for the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is that we&#39;re going to see things converge a bit to produce candidates with the best features of both approaches. These are still not going to snakebite cures by themselves, though, it has to be noted. There are other classes of nasty ingredients in snake venoms, with phospholipase enzymes near the top of the list. But these same techniques might be expected to deliver neutralizing proteins against these other targets, given the money, effort, and time, and the eventual therapy would surely be a cocktail of different proteins, ready to inject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will only come, though, if someone is willing to put in those last ingredients, especially the money. Who will step up for snakebite victims? We&#39;re attacking other tropical diseases, and this should be on the list, too.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/snake-antivenoms-computed</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/snake-antivenoms-computed</guid><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 12:36:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Versatile Chaperones</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/dealing-being-tumor-cell&quot;&gt;writing about&lt;/a&gt; chaperone proteins such as the HSPs, and today I want to mention a different sort of protein partner: pharmacological chaperones, otherwise known as &quot;correctors&quot; or &quot;stabilizers&quot;. These rose to fame with Vertex&#39;s cystic fibrosis drugs targeting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis_transmembrane_conductance_regulator&quot;&gt;CFTR&lt;/a&gt; mechanism - that&#39;s a membrane protein that serves as an ion channel (chloride and bicarbonate), and it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis_transmembrane_conductance_regulator&quot;&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; in 1989 that mutations in this protein are in fact the cause of cystic fibrosis itself. A company in San Diego (Aurora Biosciences) that specialized in ion channel behavior got a grant from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to see if there were any drug discovery approaches that might work on this target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a big task. Ion channels are famously complicated, in their behavior and in the number and variety of their small-molecular binding sites. But the team began to track down such molecules that seemed to restore some function to the protein, and this continued for years &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2019/10/23/we-conquered-a-disease-how-vertex-delivered-a-transformative-medicine-for-cystic-fibrosis/&quot;&gt;after Vertex bought Aurora&lt;/a&gt; in 2001. It&#39;s safe to say that the CF program wasn&#39;t a huge driver of that deal, but hey, it did come with its own funding. The molecules worked through some odd and not-very-well-defined mechanisms: the first one to be approved (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivacaftor&quot;&gt;ivacaftor&lt;/a&gt;) was found to work by binding to some mutants of CFTR and causing them to be able to transport chloride better than before. That turned out to be by opening a nonstandard &quot;gating&quot; process that I don&#39;t think anyone could have predicted &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;. Vertex went on to discovery other such potentiators as well as corrector molecules (starting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumacaftor&quot;&gt;lumacaftor&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and going on to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tezacaftor&quot;&gt;tezacaftor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elexacaftor&quot;&gt;elexacaftor&lt;/a&gt;) that in turn increased the amount of the protein that was properly localized to the cell membrane. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor&quot;&gt;Combinations&lt;/a&gt; of these drugs now treat a huge number of CF patients. All of the correctors work by binding to CFTR and changing its conformation so that it can be better localized from the cytoplasm (although they don&#39;t all bind to it in the same way!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that proves definitively that various sorts of small-molecule chaperones can indeed be very effective therapies, and there&#39;s been a lot of work put in to finding others. There are indeed many genetically defined diseases that are caused by less-functional mutant proteins, and the idea of fixing these &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; to a useful degree is very appealing. Another big example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migalastat&quot;&gt;migalastat&lt;/a&gt; and related correctors for the glycosidase enzymes whose mutated forms are the cause of many lysosomal storage disorders (weirdly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/132290/1/C6CC01564F.pdf&quot;&gt;many of these&lt;/a&gt; are pretty potent inhibitors of the wild-type enzyme, but can restore function to many of the mutants, although not all of them). And there&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafamidis&quot;&gt;tafamidis&lt;/a&gt; to stabilize mutant forms of &lt;span&gt;transthyretin, which otherwise tend to form harmful amyloid aggregates. &lt;/span&gt;But knowing that such things are possible doesn&#39;t make it easy to find and develop them, of course. You&#39;ll want to put a lot of effort into robust assays, in as close to real-world conditions as possible, and it will certainly help if you can rig these up for high-throughput screening. That&#39;s because trying to find such correctors or potentiators computationally is really asking for more than our current technologies are likely to be able to deliver, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.28.625821v1&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s a recent preprint&lt;/a&gt; that give some more hope to some of these discovery efforts. The authors are looking at mutated forms of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasopressin_receptor_2&quot;&gt;vasopressin 2&lt;/a&gt; G-protein coupled receptor (V2R), which are known to be a cause of the rare disease &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus&quot;&gt;nephrogenic diabetes insipidus&lt;/a&gt; (also known as arginine vasopressin resistance). These mutants are defective in the water reabsorption function of the kidneys, and patients with them are generally chronically dehydrated. Small-molecule chaperones have been identified in recent years that seem to restore some function to such V2R mutantsbut the big question is (as always) is how broad their activity might be. Note that with the CFTR drugs that several had to be discovered in order to cover the current wide range of treatable mutations, and even so the efficacy varies according to the mutation involved (and some rare mutations are still beyond treatment so far).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This latest work attacks the problem full-force by using saturation mutagenesis to make all possible single-amino-acid variants of the V2R sequence. About 7,400 of these are missense and nonsense variants, and the authors were able to study over 6800 of these in detail (although as you would figure, not all of them express well). They believe that close to 3,000 of these are truly pathological variants. The most damaging mutations are ones in any of the seven transmembrane regions, presumably because they have large effects on the conformation of the receptor in its native environment. Of these, changes in the TM3 helix are the worst, and that one had already been implicated in key parts of the receptor&#39;s functions, so that makes plenty of sense. Mutations in the transmembrane region that make these helices less hydrophobic impair both function and localization to the membrane, which also makes sense (indeed, most of the known pathogenic mutations are also poorly expressed). Meanwhile, the intra- and extracellular loops tend to be less trouble (and they&#39;re both about the same compared to each other, for that matter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking across the whole landscape at a known small-molecule V2R corrector (tolvaptan) that up until now had only been studied with about fifteen mutant forms of the receptor, the team found that &lt;em&gt;almost all of the mutant forms&lt;/em&gt; had their function improved by it. This is by far the largest study of this type that&#39;s appeared so far, and you&#39;d have to say that it&#39;s good news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accordingly, small molecules may represent a much more general strategy to rescue poorly expressed variants than is commonly perceived. The law of mass action means that to rescue expression, a small molecule only needs to bind specifically to the folded conformation of a protein and with sufficient energy to shift the folding equilibrium towards the folded state (Fig. 6). There is no requirement to specifically recognize the mutated amino acid and no requirement to bind any particular region of the protein. Similar principles apply when multiple mutations are combined in a protein, where large-scale experimental analyses have revealed that changes in fold stability are nearly always additive when diverse mutations are combined in a single protein. We believe, therefore, that many small molecules binding to proteins with sufficient free energy will behave as general or universal PCs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s hope so! The prospect of having to develop a whole list of drugs for each vulnerable protein is not an appealing one. This makes you wonder if some of the earlier cases of less-broad-spectrum pharmacological chaperones were situations where the binding of the small molecule to the protein just did not impart enough energetic stability, whereas a better one could cover more territory. This is a hypothesis that will certainly be put to the test in coming years. . .&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/versatile-chaperones</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/versatile-chaperones</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:44:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Dealing With Being a Tumor Cell</title><description>&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve made a huge amount of progress in cancer therapies over the years, but that might be a hard case to make to someone who&#39;s recently had a friend or relation die from the disease. Both viewpoints are accurate; they just come from different vantage points. Compared to what we used to know (and what we used to be able to offer), cancer treatment has never been more wide-ranging and powerful. But compared to the total landscape of oncology, there are huge gaps in our abilities and in our knowledge, and so many patients die hard deaths much too soon because of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So two types of papers cheer me up about this: the ones with immediate applications to a specific cancer type, because I know that those can start doing some good very quickly, and the big fundamental-biology ones. Those take longer to have an impact, but we need a lot of those to fill in those knowledge gaps. &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.87301&quot;&gt;This recent paper&lt;/a&gt; is an example. It&#39;s looking at how cancer cells manage to handle being, well, cancer cells. The uncontrolled growth phenotype is a hard life that comes with a lot of complications, and at the cellular level a lot of tumors are constantly racing just ahead of their own mounting problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central to that is mutational load. A great many tumor types have (famously) a lot of genomic instability, and in some cases that&#39;s what put them on the cancer pathway to start with. Such mutations can take the brakes off of cell growth and/or shut down the usual cellular death triggers that are supposed to go off in case that happens, but they obviously come with a burden of mutated proteins. That&#39;s especially true for the tumor types that spin off mutation after mutation due to defects in DNA repair and quality control mechanisms, and those are just what I had in mind with that image of cells that are just managing to outrun their own troubles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s why there have been many therapeutic ideas directed towards throwing sand into the gears of the DNA maintenance systems, in the hopes that this will push such cells past the point of no return. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn&#39;t. But the current paper illustrates an interesting split in how tumor cells handle the burden of constantly pushing out mutated (and likely misfolded) proteins, which is an unavoidable sequel of genomic instability itself. We already knew about the way that some types of cancer rev up their protein degradation machinery to clear out such proteinaceous deadwood, and that&#39;s the idea behind proteasome inhibitors like Velcade (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortezomib&quot;&gt;bortezomib&lt;/a&gt;) that inhibit the proteasome. The authors here show that another mechanism to deal with the problem is the crank up the protein chaperone/refolding pathways, in an effort to rescue these proteins before just sending them to the proteasomal shredder or into lysosomal compartments for similar destruction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misfolded proteins are of course a fact of life for any living cell, and there are a host of mechanisms that have evolved to deal with them. The so-called &quot;heat shock proteins&quot; (HSPs) are the canonical example - as the name shows they were discovered to be upregulated in cells that had been placed under artificial stress, such as sudden exposure to damaging heat. There are many HSP subtypes, but one big division is between the chaperone types that are trying to get things to fold correctly and the salvage types (the small heat shock proteins) that appear to be sequestering misfolded species in order to keep them from starting to form toxic aggregates. Such aggregation is another fact of life - there are a lot of proteins (maybe even the majority) that will clump up under the right conditions (too high a concentration, pH changes, loss of their usual partners, misfolding that exposes normally-hidden surfaces). And these aggregates can be real trouble once they form. Clearing them out is not easy, partly because of their often brick-dust-like lack of solubility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper mentioned shows that there are tumor cells that strongly upregulate the chaperone HSPs while downregulating the small HSPs. Interestingly, they also find mechanisms that seem to be engaging in quality control back at the RNA stage, sending some pre-mRNA transcripts down degradation pathways before they have a chance to be read off into proteins at all. This seems to be going on particularly with production of cytoplasmic ribosomes (themselves the means of protein production), but not with mitochondrial ribosomes (which are actually upregulated), and that has to be telling us something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, over the years there have been a number of attempts to go after the HSPs in cancer therapy, and it has to be said that these have not been as impressive as everyone hoped. But this new work suggests that if you pick your patients carefully it could still be valuable - you just have to make sure that you&#39;re dealing with cancer lines that have gone big for the &quot;crank up the chaperone proteins&quot; strategy. The authors suggest that the HSP inhibitors (and the proteasome inhibitors) be directed at cancers that are showing very high mutational load, because these should be the most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, natural selection is working very hard and fast in cancer cells, which is one of the reasons that the field can remind one so much of antibacterial and antiviral work. Indeed, organisms like yeast and bacteria (and many viruses) invest in high levels of chaperone proteins because of this same sort of mutational burden. In cancer, selection is at work promoting growth pathways (the cells that mutate into these outcompete the ones that don&#39;t), but it&#39;s also at work selecting for cells that can find some way to handle the consequences of such growth (the fast-growers that mutate into those pathways outcompete the fast growers that don&#39;t).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and they note one last thing: you know what other cells have to deal with continued accumulation of mutations, albeit not at cancer-cell pace? Old ones! But aging human tissues seem to go more for the upregulation of the small heat shock proteins and autophagy as a clearance mechanism, and the reasons for this are not yet clear. Figuring that out, and figuring out what the evolutionary pressures are the lead to these different strategies for what are similar underlying problems, will tell us a lot. . .&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/dealing-being-tumor-cell</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/dealing-being-tumor-cell</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 12:29:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Pain Comes With the Territory</title><description>&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;I last wrote here &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/new-pain-mechanism-works-pretty-much&quot;&gt;several months ago&lt;/a&gt; about the sodium channel (NaV1.8) inhibitor VX-548 (now known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzetrigine&quot;&gt;suzetrigine&lt;/a&gt;), which is under investigation as a pain relief medication. There is of course a gigantic need for effective but nonaddictive drugs in this category, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/painful-history-substance-p&quot;&gt;whole list&lt;/a&gt; of plausible ideas have gone to grief over the last few decades trying to meet it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;In that earlier post on this drug, it had shown some very interesting (though modest) activity in post-surgical patients, albeit with some questions about its efficacy relative to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocodone/paracetamol&quot;&gt;Vicodin&lt;/a&gt; standard-of-care. Vertex has been running a number of trials, because if there’s one thing that we can take away from the failed drug development projects of the past (other than “dang, pain is a hard target”), it’s that there are many kinds of pain. Acute, chronic, neuropathic, burns, cancer, phantom-limb: they are all different, and even in everyday speech we distinguish between all sorts of pain sensations (“sharp”, “dull”, “stabbing”, “shooting”, “throbbing”, “burning” and many more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;And just before the holiday break Vertex reported on another of these trials with suzetrigine in sciatica patients. More specifically, these were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430837/&quot;&gt;lumbosacral radiculopathy&lt;/a&gt; sufferers, classic sciatica where compression of nerves up by the spine lead to pain in the lower pack and down one leg. The results in over a hundred patients showed that their pain did in fact decrease. Unfortunately, an equal-sized group of patients got a placebo instead, and they saw their pain decrease, too, by a statistically indistinguishable amount as compared to the Vertex drug. Oh dear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;You really do need to run a big, robust placebo control in a pain trial, because there can be a pretty strong effect (as apparently seen here). Vertex is saying that the placebo response was all over the place in the data, and that they believe that the number is higher than it should be and that a larger Phase III trial should iron that effect out. Maybe - but in other areas where there is a substantial placebo response (such as with antidepressants) that’s not always the case. They&#39;re going to have to spend the time and money to find out. In a previous trial of the drug against diabetic neuropathic pain, suzetrigine again showed statistically significant pain reduction, but that one was not powered to make comparisons with the placebo group (although the latter patients again showed efficacy). It did beat placebo in the post-surgical pain trials, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Still, it’s hard not to see the trial results as a real dent in the suzetrigine story. A decision is due by the end of this month for Vertex’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-announces-fda-acceptance-new-drug-application-suzetrigine#:~:text=The%20FDA%20has%20granted%20suzetrigine,%2Dto%2Dsevere%20acute%20pain.&quot;&gt;filing for approval&lt;/a&gt; of the drug for moderate-to-severe acute pain, and that’s certainly being watched closely by investors and by the medical community in general. These latest results are not part of the submission to the FDA (it&#39;s directed towards acute pain, not chronic) but everyone in the room will know about them, for what it&#39;s worth. If the drug does get approved (the likely outcome), the next thing to watch will be uptake in the market. Vicodin, for all its problems, does indeed reduce a number of types of acute pain (including that of sciatica, in reference to this most recent trial), and although one hates to bring this up, it is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; cheaper than suzetrigine is going to be. The reaction of insurance companies to this situation will be crucial for the drug’s success, along of course with the experience of patients and physicians out in the real world of clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;A truly effective pain relief drug - say, one that reliably worked just the same as the hydrocodone/acetaminophen combination and without addiction/abuse potential would be a huge blockbuster. But suzetrigine probably isn’t that drug. We’ll soon start to find out just what sort of drug it really is.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/pain-comes-territory</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/pain-comes-territory</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 03:17:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A New Antiviral Target, On the Host Side</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell-chemical-biology/abstract/S2451-9456(24)00444-6&quot;&gt;This recent paper&lt;/a&gt; has a rather unexpected finding that could have some bearing on antiviral therapies. It&#39;s well established that viruses come in with a pretty minimal set of proteins to code for, and hijack as much of the host-cell machinery as they can in order to replicate. Many antiviral drugs are targeted towards such viral enzymes, since these targets have the advantage of (usually) not looking too much like host-cell human ones. That said, the universe of protein catalytic mechanisms is not infinite by any means, so if you&#39;re going after a viral polymerase you will have to make sure that you aren&#39;t developing a shotgun of a drug candidate that will go after the human ones, too, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to approach the problem is to look at those human host proteins and see if there are vulnerabilities there. The cell surface proteins that different viruses use for entry through the membrane are one of the first places people look, and you&#39;ll recall that there was an awful lot of work during the earlier part of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41580-021-00418-x&quot;&gt;entry mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; (such as ACE2). The paper I&#39;m discussing today isn&#39;t one of those, though, which makes it stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that the protein &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphingomyelin_synthase&quot;&gt;SMS1&lt;/a&gt; (sphingomyelin synthase 1) is needed for the replication of many RNA viruses, and it turns out that that&#39;s because sphingomyelin itself is needed for the functioning of the viral RNA polymerases. Cells that had SMS1 knocked out were extremely resistant to infection by RNA viruses, but supplementing them with extra sphingomyelin restored the ability of the viruses to reproduce. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphingomyelin&quot;&gt;Sphingomyelin itself&lt;/a&gt; is one of a broader class of sphinolipids, of which it is the king in terms of cellular abundance. Up to 20% of a cell&#39;s membrane can consist of it, and it&#39;s very important in intracellular membrane structures as well. But it&#39;s not just scaffolding - the molecule is involved in a number of signaling pathways, as are related ones that are produced during its synthesis and degradation (it&#39;s the usual forest of added functions you find after a couple of billion years of just letting things run).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it appears that RNA viruses have joined that particular party. They carry no machinery of their own to make sphingomyelin, but borrow it from the infected cell for their own purposes (and apparently cannot do without it). The authors show that inhibitors at several points of the SM synthesis and trafficking pathways are capable of disrupting viral infection, and they have also tracked down the site of the sphingomyelin action, both in the cell (at the Golgi apparatus) and on a protein level (a particular region of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, residues 480-513.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all ties in with previous reports that have implicated the sphingomyelin pathway in RNA viral infection and seems to clear the story up a great deal. It looks, in fact, like a long list of RNA viruses have the key binding site in their RdRp enzymes, which suggests the very interesting chance of a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy. The paper in fact shows that a small-molecule SMS1 enzyme inhibitor seems to have beneficial activity against several RNA viruses, our dear friend SARS-CoV-2 being one of them. Their compound in fact protected mice from an otherwise fatal infectious load of SVTSV (severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus), an emerging tick-borne illness. Interestingly, a host factor screen &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8523828/&quot;&gt;has been done&lt;/a&gt; with that one, but it did not turn up the sphingomyelin connection. There&#39;s always room to go back in and try these genomic/proteomic experiments again from a different angle, never forget!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&#39;s keep an eye on this idea. I assume that we humans will be able to deal with a sphingomyelin synthase inhibitor long enough to get past a viral infection, but of course that remains to be proven. The usefulness of a broad-spectrum RNA-virus drug is definitely worth the effort!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/new-antiviral-target-host-side</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/new-antiviral-target-host-side</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 01:27:28 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Inside a Fentanyl Kitchen</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s take one of our occasional visits to the dark side of pharmaceutical chemistry, prompted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/world/americas/inside-fentanyl-lab-mexico.html&quot;&gt;this deeply alarming first-hand visit&lt;/a&gt; of some &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reporters to a fentanyl lab in Sinaloa.

But these two (and a photographer, even) managed to get access, and holy crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;We had just walked into the fentanyl lab when the cook poured a white powder into a stockpot full of liquid. He began mixing it with an immersion blender and fumes rose from the pot, filling the small kitchen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;We wore gas masks and hazmat suits, but the cook had on only a surgical mask. He and his partner had rushed here to fulfill an order for 10 kilograms of fentanyl. While one sniff of the toxic chemicals could kill us, they explained, they had built up a tolerance to the lethal drug.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;But then, the cook jerked back. &quot;It really hit me,&quot; he said, looking dazed. &quot;I need to take a breather&quot;. The young man rushed out of the room.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a turf war among rival drug cartels in the state since last fall, which the article mentions has broken up and scattered the usual patterns of fentanyl manufacture. Out go economies of scale and centralized production, to the extent that those were in effect (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/not-such-better-living-through-chemistry&quot;&gt;they are&lt;/a&gt; for methamphetamine synthesis) and in come the kitchens of houses on residential streets. The very high potency of the drug makes this feasible - 10kg, as many will realize, is a hell of a lot of fentanyl by most people&#39;s standards. Now, I wouldn&#39;t go in that kitchen without a gas mask and a hazmat suit either (and you&#39;d probably have to pull a gun on me even then, which conditions I&#39;m sure the gentlemen involved would be able to provide, but it&#39;s not as much from the worries about fentanyl exposure itself. It is a powerful drug, no doubt about it, but the lore around it makes it seems as if it can kill you from ten feet away, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/fainting-fentanyl-exposure-nope&quot;&gt;this is not the case&lt;/a&gt;. Even being exposed to the fumes from someone smoking the stuff is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychiatrist.com/news/why-the-fear-of-second-hand-fentanyl-smoke-may-be-overblown/&quot;&gt;not nearly as hazardous&lt;/a&gt; as you&#39;d imagine, although I would still very much advise avoiding that situation on general principles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I&#39;d be more worried about good old fashioned chemical fumes, and I would think that this is what probably overcame the drug cook in the above excerpt. I would not expect the vapors to be carrying fentanyl itself - although admittedly on a ten-kilo scale they wouldn&#39;t have to carry very much to be problematic. (In the case of being around a fent user, the smoke you&#39;re exposed to is almost completely pre-extracted by exposure to the lungs of said user). So what might have that have been?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s hard to say what step of the synthesis the NY Times folks were seeing there, though. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.euda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/fentanyl_en&quot;&gt;standard fentanyl synthesis&lt;/a&gt; starts from 4-piperidone hydrochloride, which is reacted in the presence of base with either phenethyl bromide or phenethyl tosylate to alkylate the piperidone nitrogen. The next step is reductive amination on the ketone with aniline, and then the product of that reaction is reacting with propionyl chloride to form the amide. So the white powder described could be several things, but only the last step produces actual fentanyl. And it seems highly unlikely that even that would produce fentanyl-laden fumes on addition. The reporters also describe a fire in a stovetop pot that filled the room with &quot;reddish-tinted&quot; smoke, and it&#39;s hard to pin that down, too (my first thought there was a nitric acid reaction, but the synthesis that I&#39;m familiar with doesn&#39;t use it). Now, none of the solvents and reagents involved are going to improve you if you stand around breathing them - phenethyl bromide is a dollar-store-level tear gas, for starters, and propionyl chloride manages to be acrid, corrosive, and smell repulsive all at the same time. I don&#39;t recommend soaking up aniline fumes, either. The cookpot dude got a strong gust of one of these and/or reaction solvent, and that&#39;s more than enough to send anyone into the hallway. No doubt these folks do have a greater-than-normal tolerance for fentanyl, but no one works up a tolerance for propionyl chloride. Of that you can be sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article and the accompanying photos/video show a couple of masked guys stirring stewpots of white powder suspension over open burners, and there are few if any organic solvents that I would recommend doing that with. Everything is being done with kitchen-and-hardware-store materials (serving spoons, used plastic mayonnaise jars, metal buckets, etc.) The article mentions acetone being brought in, a solvent that I can well believe, and also shows a tray of what they were told was sodium hydroxide (&quot;a fentanyl ingredient&quot;), and it certainly does look like it (down to being a bit shiny as it picks up humidity from the air - that stuff hadn&#39;t been sitting there for long). That might well be the base in the first-step alkylation? But you wouldn&#39;t do that in acetone; the solvent would be too reactive. An unexpected shot shows one of the chefs adding blue dye to a finished batch of the drug - that shade is the particular cartel&#39;s trade dress, it seems, along with presses that leave any desired insignia in the surfaces of the pills themselves. A different world, and one that I hope I never see in much greater detail!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/inside-fentanyl-kitchen</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/inside-fentanyl-kitchen</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:47:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Carbyne Remains Elusive</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/new-forms-carbon&quot;&gt;wrote here&lt;/a&gt; some years ago about a report of the preparation of carbyne, a hypothetical allotrope of carbon made up of long rods of connected CC triple bonds. The mental picture that evokes raises some immediate questions, such as what might be at the ends of said chains (just a hydrogen, or?) and especially about the stability of such a structure. What&#39;s been explored of the conjugated acetylenes (polyynes) is not encouraging. There are examples known of up to ten or twelve units, but in order for the longer ones to exist they generally need some sort of large blocking organometallic group. Unsubstituted polyynes are notoriously reactive and prone to sudden, vigorous, exothermic crosslinking reactions, and if you&#39;re imagining that this is accompanied by loud noises and things breaking, you are correct-o-tronic. So it&#39;s been difficult to figure how you could get real samples of bulk-phase carbyne given this behavior, unless some other factors kick in at longer chain lengths (and it&#39;s hard to figure what those could be, other than maybe things that make the stabilities even worse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.z02qs56/rss/pseudocarbyne-1736346637267.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;Nobelist Harry Kroto was a vocal critic of papers claiming to have prepared carbyne (and there have been quite a few). Indeed, his &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.6b00671&quot;&gt;last publication&lt;/a&gt; (during his lifetime) &lt;a href=&quot;https://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i20/Harry-Krotos-last-words-carbyne.html&quot;&gt;suggested that&lt;/a&gt; the same report that I blogged about above was in error, and the the gold used in the compound&#39;s preparation was instead incorporated into the structure of a &quot;pseudocarbyne&quot;. And now the same group that co-authored with him on that work has returned with experimental evidence &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-80359-5&quot;&gt;in a new paper&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s taken a great deal of careful X-ray and electron microscopy work, but they have the structure of the gold-derived putative carbyne, and it is indeed a complex of carbyne chains (six- and eight-carbon ones) with repeating gold atoms as an integral part of its structure, stabilising the conjugated carbons along their length. The spacing around the gold atoms also keeps the chains from crosslinking with each other so readily. Interestingly, similarly gold-compound-stabilized polyyne chains have recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008622324003373?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;been reported by another group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests several conclusions: the 2015 report of &quot;real carbyne&quot; is wrong, for starters. And it&#39;s also very likely that the other reports of carbyne preparations are similarly flawed - it would not at all be surprising if they are all being stabilized by inter-chain metal atoms as in gold examples. These are dissipating the charge so as to keep things from falling (violently) apart, and these results raise even more doubt about whether carbyne &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; can exist at all. But these bundles-of-carbon-sticks-and-metals are interesting in their own right, and worth study. To get the most out of them, though, we&#39;re going to have to stop pretending that they&#39;re The Long Sought Carbyne and deal with them as they are rather what we might wish they were.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/carbyne-remains-elusive</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/carbyne-remains-elusive</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 08:56:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Another GLP-1 Year</title><description>&lt;p&gt;If you thought that 2024 (or 2023) was the Year of the GLP-1 Agonists, then hold on for 2025. (I sound like the sponsored-year calendar system in &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3C0hrfZ&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!) This has of course been a huge story (in drug discovery, in business, in public health, and in society in general) and it&#39;s not going to get any less prominent. I enjoyed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03380-1&quot;&gt;this overview&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; about the major unanswered questions around these drugs, and I think that they provide a good framework to evaluate the news that will be coming about them. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. We already have seen effects on protection of other organs (with kidney disease being one of the most dramatic so far). And there appear to be many others that could benefit. But what&#39;s not clear yet is how far these will extend to people without diabetes or who are not very obese to start with. And the balance between &quot;benefits due to weight loss&quot; and &quot;benefits due to GLP-1 agonism itself&quot; is also not well understood. This is going to take quite a while to figure out, but we&#39;re going to learn a lot in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. How long do you need to take these drugs, anyway? And what happens if and when you stop? That&#39;s going to be tied up with that first question, because different organ systems may well respond differently under these conditions. And of course there&#39;s going to be the problem of untangling effects that are caused by the cessation of added GLP-1 stimulation versus those that are caused by regaining adipose tissue. While we&#39;re on that topic, just how much weight will someone regain, and how long will that take? Will they respond just as strongly to another round of therapy, or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. What&#39;s the effect of GLP-1 agonism on addiction? There are a number of trials (of varying size and power) that have attempted (and are attempting) to answer this question. Naturally, there&#39;s a huge amount of interest here, but I think we&#39;re also going to have a lot of dust in the air around this question. There are biochemical similarities among various addictive behaviors, for sure, but there are clear differences as well. The ideal situation would be for GLP-1 to hit things at a very basic level and prove beneficial for all kinds of situations, but you&#39;d have to think that the answer is going to be more heterogeneous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. How about other CNS effects? There&#39;s some hope that GLP-1 drugs could slow neurodegeneration, but getting hard data on that is going to be even more of an uphill climb in some ways. Good clinical data on such agents comes on slowly, because so does neurodegeneration. And there are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of forms of neurodegeneration, so the question will be similar to the last one: will GLP-1 agonisms affect some fundamental processes that are common to many (or all) of them, or not? It is very much worth finding out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. What are the differences between GLP-1 agonist effects in men and women? It may be surprising that we don&#39;t really have a solid answer to this yet, but here we might be closer to an answer, given the huge number of people taking them. Observational studies will be able to tell us quite a bit here, I hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. And finally, is an oral GLP-1 therapy feasible? Vast amounts of money are being thrown at this question, because taking a pill is always going to be more appealing than get an injection. Some proportion of that money will turn out to have been thrown into a giant incinerator, but unfortunately we don&#39;t know which part of the work those are yet! It will only become clear as the smoke starts to rise into the sky. There are subsidiary questions about the level of efficacy seen via the two routes and its duration, along with how the side effect profile might be. One of the most prominent disadvantages of the current drugs is gastrointestinal trouble, so will dropping the drugs directly into the gut make that worse, or not? There&#39;s only one way to find out - the expensive one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So hang on, because we&#39;re going to get looks at all of these and more with time. The drug companies involved are even more interested in the question of Whose Drug Comes Out On Top, naturally, but that&#39;s going to take some time to figure out, too, given the number of variations on the theme that we&#39;re seeing put into development. . .&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/another-glp-1-year</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/another-glp-1-year</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 01:00:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Two More Great Names Pass</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Right as last year closed out came news of the deaths of two well-known chemists: J. Fraser Stoddart and Martin Karplus. Both were Nobel laureates (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2016/stoddart/facts/&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2013/karplus/facts/&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, blogged about at this site &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/molecular-machinery-2016-nobel-prize-chemistry&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/2013-nobel-prize-chemistry&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Stoddart&#39;s prize was in macromolecular chemistry, large assemblies of unusual synthetic structures. This was an area that went from a research curiosity to a far more active area of study over the years as the tools needed to make and analyze such structures improved, and what has resulted is foundational work for actual nanotechnology applications (molecular-sized switches, actuators, amplifiers and more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Karplus&#39; name is first &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karplus_equation&quot;&gt;familiar to anyone&lt;/a&gt; who has ever taken a proton NMR spectrum. The &quot;Karplus curve&quot; relates proton-proton coupling constants to the dihedral angle between them and was worked out in the early days of NMR. It has has proven spectacularly useful in structural and conformational studies and it&#39;s one of the first things you learn in interpreting an NMR spectrum in organic chemistry. But in more recent decades he did a great deal of foundational work in computational chemistry, specifically molecular dynamics (the simulation and prediction of time-dependent changes in molecular shapes and interactions). This is of course a massive area of research to this day and is vital to the modeling of protein behavior (and protein-ligand behavior), to catalyst function, and to many other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time does indeed move on. Vladimir Nabokov was asked once in an interview about rumors that he was going to leave his adopted city of Montreaux, and replied &quot;There is a rumor that everyone in Montreaux is going to leave it eventually&quot;. But scientists like Stoddart and Karplus (and authors like Nabokov!) have a legacy that will live after them. Science especially will go on to build larger, more complex, and more powerful tools and structures as time goes on, and the work of both famous practitioners like Stoddart and Karplus and that of huge numbers of lesser-known scientists will be a part of it forever.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/two-more-great-names-pass</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/two-more-great-names-pass</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2025 11:54:29 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Recipes Blogging: Kebab-e-Koobideh</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m starting to ease back into work, but I wanted to note that I do actually use my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site:science.org/content/blog-post+recipe&quot;&gt;recipes&lt;/a&gt; that I post here during holidays. I made a batch of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/holiday-blogging-gingersnaps&quot;&gt;gingersnaps&lt;/a&gt; for Christmas, for starters. We had the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/another-cold-weather-recipe-chicken-pot-pie&quot;&gt;chicken pot pie&lt;/a&gt; while my mother-in-law was here as well, and yesterday I made the (traditional around this house) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/recipe-blogging-bean-soup-country-ham-and-cornbread&quot;&gt;bean soup and cornbread&lt;/a&gt; for New Year&#39;s Day. There&#39;s a big jar of the giardiniera &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/recipe-blogging-varieties-pickles&quot;&gt;pickles&lt;/a&gt; in the fridge, and another jar of the sauerkraut from that post fermenting downstairs as I write. The lemon-fennel &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/cold-weather-food-lemon-fennel-roasted-chicken&quot;&gt;roast chicken&lt;/a&gt; was on the table not long ago, too, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/recipe-blogging-joojeh-kebab&quot;&gt;joojeh kebab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/recipe-time-adas-pollo&quot;&gt;adas pollo&lt;/a&gt; are in regular rotation around here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the spirit of those last two, let me add another kebab recipe from my wife&#39;s side of the family, one that will be familiar to anyone who&#39;s had food from that region: kebab-e-koobideh. This is to be found in pretty much any Iranian restaurant, and in pretty much any place where Iranians have a grill going, in my experience (!) I realize that it&#39;s January and I&#39;m telling you about a dish that is best grilled over an open fire, but what the heck: You&#39;ll need a pound and a half to two pounds (900g) of ground beef, or a 1:1 mixture of ground beef and ground lamb, if you&#39;re feeling particularly fancy. I would advise buying the 85% ground beef; you really do need some fat content in this dish or it can turn out dry and crumbly. Take a small-to-medium onion and chop it up very finely until you have a wet onion slush (a food processor will do a good job) and strain out the pungent onion water from it by pressing it on a colander (or in a pinch, by squeezing it in a paper towel). Add the now-less-slushy onion to the ground meat, and add a beaten egg to the mix as well. Throw in about a teaspoon of table salt (3g), a half teaspoon of ground black pepper (a bit over a gram), and a half teaspoon of turmeric powder (1.5g). If for some reason you have the Persian spice mixture called &quot;advieh&quot; around, use that instead of the turmeric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mix all of this together, and you might as well go ahead and use your hands, because you&#39;re going to need to use them to form the kebabs anyway! The traditional form for these is flattened rods long enough to cross your plate, and that&#39;s because the traditional way to grill them is to form them around a long flat metal skewer. You can buy those at Middle Eastern shops, but realistically, you&#39;re probably not going to have them around otherwise. So in that case I would recommend forming them into the needed shape without a skewer, perhaps a bit shorter than you would otherwise, and prepare to cook them on the grill grates with a spatula flip partway through. Trying to do them on a rod-type skewer is inviting trouble during the cooking process. You can also broil them in an oven, which works pretty well if they&#39;re on a grate or rack, and the last expedient is to cook them in a hot pan (which gets the job done in utilitarian fashion, but the grilling is really the way to go if you can manage it). If you&#39;re in a pan, you&#39;ll want to get the cooking juices out of there as things go on or you&#39;ll just be boiling/steaming the meat instead. It&#39;s common to brush these with melted butter as they cook, and if you&#39;re going to be really Persian about the whole thing you&#39;ll use butter with a bit of saffron mixed into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cook pretty quickly over a hot fire, so if you&#39;re going to have the traditional vegetables on the side you&#39;ll need to start those first. Plum tomatoes, white onion, and green or red peppers are the usual, and here&#39;s a chance to note that all of these take different amounts of time to cook properly. Those pictures many of us grew up seeing of colorful kebab mixtures together on a skewer? That&#39;s generally not the best way to do it, in my view. The kebabs and veggies are almost invariably served with basmati rice, and the traditional seasoning once off the grill is dark-red ground sumac (which you can also find at Middle Eastern stores).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are variations: some people put a bit of finely chopped garlic into the kebab meat, for example. And there are cookbooks that advocate adding a bit of baking soda to it as well, supposedly to give the meat a lighter texture as it cooks (I&#39;ve never actually done this). If you want to wow the crowd, try using a piece of thin &lt;em&gt;lavash&lt;/em&gt; bread (folded a bit!) to take the kebabs off the skewer once they&#39;re done - this is how the real &quot;kebabi men&quot; do it in the homeland of this dish, but I haven&#39;t tried that one either!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/recipes-blogging-kebab-e-koobideh</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/recipes-blogging-kebab-e-koobideh</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2025 11:05:36 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Recipe Blogging: Varieties of Pickles</title><description>&lt;p&gt;We go through a lot of pickles around here - my wife and I, and both of our kids when they&#39;re here. They grew up that way, and regard their occasional contacts with people who dislike pickles (or are just indifferent to them) with puzzlement and pity. We always have store-bought ones around, but the fridge generally has home-made varieties in it, and I thought I&#39;d pass some of those along.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.zc5drm1/rss/gardiniera-1735581283897.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;These range from &quot;Extremely easy, nay, downright cheating&quot; all the way to real fermentation. I&#39;ll take them in that order, so the first one is a home version of the &lt;strong&gt;giardiniera vegetable pickle mix&lt;/strong&gt; that you can buy jarred at the store. You get to choose what goes in there this way - we generally have carrots, cauliflower, onion, celery, and bell pepper, and make some jars with a sliced-up garlic clove and some without. Your choice! You&#39;ll want to wash these and cut them into useful-sized pieces since you&#39;ll be fishing them out of the jar and eating them later on. Pack the mixture pretty firmly into jars with lids - you won&#39;t be canning these per se, but the Mason-type jars used for that work great. Failing that, you can use plastic containers or even sturdy zip-closure plastic bags if you like living on the edge. &lt;em&gt;The finished pickles will need to be kept in a refrigerator until eaten&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you&#39;ll make a vinegar brine. I use 2 1/2 cups (590 mL) of water and 2 1/2 cups of white vinegar, with 1 tablespoon of Morton&#39;s kosher salt. The salt is always the finicky part in such recipes, because (1) a lot of home/traditional recipes in the US measure it by volume the way I just did and (2) there sure are a lot of varieties of salt out there. You&#39;re better off with weight if you have a kitchen scale - that tablespoon of Morton&#39;s is 16g, and that of course means 16 grams of whatever salt you&#39;re using yourself (although I will say that iodized table salt can give an off flavor for some people - I&#39;m pro-iodine in table salt, but not necessarily for this application). If you have Diamond Crystal, the other big brand of kosher salt, a tablespoon of that is only 10 grams, while a tablespoon of &quot;regular&quot; table salt is 23! So by volume that one tablespoon of Morton&#39;s kosher would be 1.5 tablespoons of Diamond Crystal or just under two teaspoons of table salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heat up the vinegar-water-salt mixture to dissolve the salt, and I pour that over the vegetables in their jars while it&#39;s still warm (in the theory that it softens them up a bit). You&#39;ll want to cover all the vegetable pieces as much as you can. But you&#39;ll be fine if you don&#39;t heat anything up - remember, these are being stored in the fridge. I do leave them standing covered with their lids overnight before transferring into the cold, and that&#39;s no problem. I like to leave them in there a week or two before starting in on them - they will get softer with time, as would any of us if we were immersed in dilute acetic acid, to be fair. So make what you&#39;ll eat in a reasonable amount of time (two or three months).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second variation is &lt;strong&gt;cucumber bread and butter pickles&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;This recipe is also not canned, and needs to be stored in the refrigerator&lt;/em&gt;. Where I grew up, &quot;bread and butter&quot; referred to &quot;simultaneously vinegary and sweet&quot; pickles, but the ratio varies a lot from place to place. Some bread-and-butter mixtures are just too syrupy for me; the recipe below is a bit more bracing, and you can adjust for taste when you see how it goes. It should be noted that this one may be more of a summer recipe, because it&#39;ll work best with fresh cucumbers. I do this one with a mixture of small (pickling/Kirby) cucumbers and sliced white onions, packing these into glass jars like the gardiniera mixture above. But feel free to extend the recipe to other vegetables and experiment! In this case, the brine I use is 2 cups of water (about 235 mL) and 2 cups of white vinegar (same 1:1 ratio as before), and this one has 4 tablespoons (1/4 cup) of Morton&#39;s kosher salts (aka 64 grams salt - I actually go a bit scant on that quarter cup, so you should be fine with 50 to 60 grams of salt) along with 1/2 cup white sugar (100g). You&#39;ll probably have to heat this one up to dissolve it relatively quickly - I let it cool a bit but again I pour it over the vegetables while it&#39;s still warm. Store them in the cold, and again, I give them at least a week before starting to eat them. But see what works for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for some fermentation, with &lt;strong&gt;half-sour cucumber pickles&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the sort of pickle you&#39;ll get at delis in the greater NYC area and throughout the urban Northeast, and they are very tasty, but I don&#39;t make them as much because they are a bit of a moving target due to the natural fermentation. &lt;em&gt;Note that these are also stored cold&lt;/em&gt;. You&#39;ll start out with pickling cucumbers again (so again, this may be more of a summer recipe because of the availability of good ones). Leave them whole (you can slice a bit off the blossom end, which is said to improve them during pickling, but I&#39;ve done it both ways). These are traditionally seasoned with garlic at the very least (about four cloves for a one-quart jar), and generally with fresh dill as well (several good-sized sprigs of it). A few black peppercorns are a good addition, and you can add some coriander seeds (which also show up in a lot of recipes). For this one, the brine is 20g of salt in four cups (470 mL) of water. That salt would be two tablespoons of Diamond Crystal, a fairly scant tablespoon of table salt, or a tablespoon plus a teaspoon of Morton&#39;s kosher. You see why weight is preferable! Pour this over the whole cucumbers in the jars, but leave some room at the top, and don&#39;t tighten the lids down! That&#39;s because these guys are going to start real fermentation with real lactobacilli (present on the surfaces of all real cucumbers!) Put them in the fridge for at least four or five days before eating them. They&#39;ll be good at least up to a month in there, but they will get less bright green, a bit softer, and more sour as time goes on. If you get some white stuff on the surface of the liquid, fear not - that&#39;s some adventitious yeast and will do no harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.zc5drm1/rss/sauerkraut-1735581283897.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;The last on the list is outright &lt;strong&gt;sauerkraut&lt;/strong&gt;, which is ridiculously easy (outside of finding a good kraut-weight; see below). I never liked it as a kid, but developed a taste for it later on, and the home-made stuff is superior to most of the stuff you can buy. You also again have your choice of when to eat it, but I find that it changes much less rapidly than the half-sour pickles can. Start with some green/white cabbage and shred it finely, with an eye to what you can firmly pack into jars (but definitely not all the way up to the top!) and also to how much sauerkraut you&#39;re up to eating in the next weeks or months. The only other key ingredient is salt, and the best way to do it (again) is by weight. I use 2% salt by weight to the cabbage. You can mix this up in a bowl and pack it into jars then, or layer cabbage into the jars with repeated salt sprinklings from your pre-weighed amount (just be sure to use the whole 2%). Other additions can include caraway seeds, a couple of juniper berries (if you have &#39;em), perhaps even a couple of garlic cloves. But try it plain the first time. At this point you&#39;ll want to put something in the jar to keep the cabbage below the level of the liquid that will develop - I do this is wide-mouth pickling jars, and we I use a tiny &quot;gift-sized&quot; jam jar that will just fit through the opening. I weigh that one down with water or salt and screw down its lid, then put it in a small plastic bag to reduce the possible mess, and lower that down onto the top of the cabbage. There are plenty of other ways to do it, and you can even buy thick glass discs to drop into the jars. You&#39;ll want to store the fresh kraut prep somewhere cooler than room temperature, but not really at refrigerator levels, either (in my case, our basement works well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes your cabbage will be fresh enough to release enough liquid to cover itself; often (in my experience) it won&#39;t. In that case, you can add some more brine after a day or two, about 4 or 5 grams of salt per cup of water, to fill it more and cover the cabbage. The idea behind that weight is to keep the packed cabbage under the liquid level. That&#39;s one reason I say not to pack it all the way up to the top, because you need some head space of liquid (and weight) up there. The other reason is that in the first week or so you will get some vigorous lactobacilli fermentation with the formation of plenty of carbon dioxide bubbles within the shredded cabbage, which tends to expand its volume. You can see this effect in the photo. Prepare for possible spillovers! After about a week you&#39;ll be at the crunchy-but-definitely-fermented &quot;fresh kraut&quot; stage, and as time goes on it will get softer and a bit more transparent. You&#39;ll be able to see that commercial sauerkraut is generally heavily aged by home standards. If you want to extend any particular stage you reach, put the jar in the fridge and things will slow down dramatically. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/recipe-blogging-varieties-pickles</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/recipe-blogging-varieties-pickles</guid><pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2024 11:08:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Targeted Cancer Drugs, Succeeding and Failing</title><description>&lt;p&gt;You get widely varied perspective on targeted cancer therapeutics depending on where you get your information from. Cancer therapy centers in the US like to advertise as if they can zero right in on a particular patient&#39;s particular sort of cancer and then reach up on the shelves to pick out which of the thousands of alternatives will be most efficacious. Now it&#39;s true that we can do more of that than we used to, but the real-world situation is messier: there are indeed targeted cancer therapies out there, but they don&#39;t cover very broad swaths of the cancer landscape. It&#39;s hard to feel fortunate with a cancer diagnosis, but if you end up with one that lands squarely on one of the targeted drugs, then fortunate is the only way to describe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, inside the industry narrowly targeted therapies are (and long have been) a real balancing act. Market size versus efficacy will do that, because outright cures are worth a great deal, but are extremely rare, and the scale slides down from there. If there are only a small number of patients who will ever be taking the drug, it&#39;s going to be expensive (and it means that those few had better be pretty well served by it). But if there&#39;s a huge population of patients, you can be sure that some of them will respond better to it than others, generally due to factors beyond anyone&#39;s control (if they&#39;re understood at all). Mechanistically, there are some tumor types that really do seem to be driven by a particular pathway, and if you hammer that pathway then patients have a very strong chance of benefiting from the treatment. The BCR-Abl therapies directed towards acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are an example of this. But other tumor types are unfortunately more versatile (and often contain a wider variety of mutated cells), and these are the very-bad-prognosis ones like glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer. It is highly unlikely that you&#39;ll find a single pathway to target for those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acsptsci.4c00492&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; illustrates some of the details. It&#39;s looking at a particular kinase inhibitor (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasatinib&quot;&gt;dasatinib&lt;/a&gt;, Sprycel) that is very effective indeed against Philadelphia-chromosome-positive CML and is also included in ALL therapies, both because of its Abl kinase inhibitor activity. (Nice note about its generic name &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20171210232159/http://cenblog.org/the-haystack/2012/01/jagabandhu-das-dasatinib/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!) Dasatinib was considered a second-generation drug after &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib&quot;&gt;imatinib&lt;/a&gt; (Gleevec), a prototype in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcr-Abl_tyrosine-kinase_inhibitor&quot;&gt;this area&lt;/a&gt;, and has been particularly &lt;a href=&quot;https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/66/11/5790/525698/The-Structure-of-Dasatinib-BMS-354825-Bound-to&quot;&gt;useful&lt;/a&gt; in some imatinib-resistant cases. It also is a strong inhibitor of Src kinase, and this led to a whole string of clinical trials against solid tumors where Src is known to be important. But in contrast to the Ph+ leukemia trials, these have been pretty unrewarding (Ph- blood cancers likewise). Table 2 of the paper has the grim statistics - failure after failure in trials against various sorts of lung and breast cancer and several others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the paper argues, no one had shown that Src activity was a primary driver of any particular tumor type (against, as opposed to the Philadelphia chromosome Abl activity in those leukemia types). Dasatinib is outright cytotoxic to those latter cells, and the resulting elimination of them is a big factor in its clinical success. But shutting down Src doesn&#39;t really kill cancer cells - it slows down their growth and cell division, sure, and you&#39;d hope that such cytostatic activity would be worth something, but the clinical results say otherwise. (I&#39;m reminded once again about the similarities between oncology treatments and antibacterials, where there has been a longrunning debate about the usefulness of bacteriostatic agents as opposed to the bacteriocidal ones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors stress that the preclinical cell and animal model tests of dasatinib really did predict its activity in the clinic, although at the time many people talked about a disconnect. The problem was that slowing solid tumor growth was considered enough of a reason to be optimistic, and it really wasn&#39;t. That means, they say, that oncology research teams really should value selective cytotoxicity and prioritize targets and compounds that show evidence of it, rather than chasing after cytostatic agents that might never show enough power on their own. But that &quot;on their own&quot; is there for a reason, because something like dasatinib can be a valuable thing to throw into a cocktail that features &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; cytotoxic agents (and indeed, there are several examples of this). You&#39;d rather work on something that can be a frontline therapy, other things being equal, but we have a number of these compounds out there and they can still be put to use.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/targeted-cancer-drugs-succeeding-and-failing</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/targeted-cancer-drugs-succeeding-and-failing</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2024 11:40:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Drugs Inside Cells - A Bit of Light</title><description>&lt;p&gt;People outside of drug discovery are often quite surprised to find out how little we know about what happens to our compounds once they get into cells. It&#39;s a hard problem, though - the quantities are small, and the compounds don&#39;t have any particular handles on them to let you see them or track them. And of course the cellular environment is complex, to put it mildly. The cytoplasm itself is a near-gelatinous mixture of thousands of components, and there are multiple organelles scattered around, each with their own membranes and transport phenomena. The difference between a drug candidate working and not working can easily come down to its intracellular fate, but we spend a lot of time putting compounds into cellular assays and crossing our fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.97255&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; (a collaboration between the Weizmann Institue and the Czech Academy of Sciences) sheds some light on the topic, and there are some actionable recommendation in it. The authors have not solved the &quot;Where&#39;s my molecule&quot; problem in general, but instead have used several drugs that have enough intrinsic fluorescence for their preferred analytical technique. That&#39;s a refined version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_recovery_after_photobleaching&quot;&gt;FRAP&lt;/a&gt; (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching), which can tell you quite a bit about molecular diffusion and compartmentalization. The idea behind FRAP is that you introduce some fluorescent species into a cell (a small molecule or a modified-and-now-fluorescent protein) and use the appropriate excitation wavelength to make it glow. Then you pick a small (subcellular) region of interest and hit that very hard with a blast of light to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photobleaching&quot;&gt;photobleach&lt;/a&gt;&quot; the fluorescent compounds/proteins in that spot - that&#39;s the term for chemically decomposing it so that it&#39;s not even a fluorescent species any more. Most fluorescent species will fall apart like this if you hit them too hard and/or too long, and fluorescent imagine experiments always have to be designed with that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So once you&#39;ve bleached out that small spot, if you go back to &quot;normal&quot; illumination you&#39;ll have a cell with lit-up green areas (or whatever color you&#39;re working with) and a dark spot where you zapped it. Now you sit back and wait to see &lt;em&gt;how long it takes for that fluorescence to recover&lt;/em&gt;. The molecules you bleached out are not going to do it; they&#39;re out of the game for good. Any fluorescence that shows up in the dark spot has to come from the movement of fresh ones into that region (by diffusion and/or transporters), and it can be very interesting to see how long that takes and under what conditions it happens.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors in this team have previously done a lot of work using a variant of this technique called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283621000929&quot;&gt;Line-FRAP&quot;&lt;/a&gt; where the bleaching light is scanned rapidly across a single line in a cell, and this allows for much better time resolution of the resulting changes. There are always going to be some assumptions about the diffusion of molecules built into the data workup of a FRAP experiment, but this method cuts back on those as well. What they find is that acidic or neutral proteins diffuse freely in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells, as do negatively charged acidic molecules like fluorescein. It&#39;s true, though, that a fraction of it seems to become sequestered or somehow immobile at a 24-hour checkpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to basic molecules, though, the situation changes. A GSK3 inhibitor (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3383737/&quot;&gt;SB216763&lt;/a&gt;) with some intrinsic fluorescence showed accumulation in lysosomes, which is what we expect from basic compounds. This accumulation increased on a scale of hours, and the FRAP measurements also supported the idea of diffusion being rather slow. The same holds for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mepacrine&quot;&gt;quinacrine&lt;/a&gt;, an old antimalarial compound. It&#39;s more soluble than the kinase inhibitor, but it still has slow diffusion rates in the cytoplasm, and by 24 hours it&#39;s pretty much all piled up in the acidic compartments of lysosomes as well. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primaquine&quot;&gt;Primaquine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Amidoquine&quot;&gt;amidoquine&lt;/a&gt; have very similar behavior, as does the anticancer quinone drug &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitoxantrone&quot;&gt;mitoxantrone&lt;/a&gt;. Going back to fluorescein, the use of 5-amino fluorescein showed that it now fit into this category - a weakly basic drug that shows slow cytosolic diffusion and lysosomal accumulation. The extra amino group was all it needed. Other dyes and antibodies did not reveal any sites of accumulation other than the lysosomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bafilomycin&quot;&gt;Bafilomycin A1&lt;/a&gt; and also sodium azide as agents to inhibit ATPase activity and thus block the acidification of the lysosomal compartments. You have to be careful with these, because they&#39;re quite toxic and can just send cells spiraling down apoptosis pathways, but it&#39;s true that HeLa cells are not all that easy to kill, comparatively speaking. These additions greatly reduced lysosomal volumes and drug accumulation therein, but the slow diffusion in the cytoplasm didn&#39;t really change, showing that these are separate and unrelated effects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, taking slow-diffusing species such as primaquine and BODIPY-NH2 and acetylating them (to remove their basic character) greatly improve their diffusion rates in the cytoplasm (as well as keeping them out of the lysosomes). But as just mentioned, the FRAP measurements that this paper provides show that the slow diffusion is not just a consequence of the compounds piling up the that compartment - their diffusion is very slow while they&#39;re still out in the cytoplasm itself, and the authors note that this is not a phenomenon that can be easily reproduced in abiotic model systems. They conclude that &quot;&lt;em&gt;in vitro biophysical crowding studies for small molecule drugs are of limited value&lt;/em&gt;&quot; and that reducing the basicity of drug candidates not only alters their eventual destinations in the cell but greatly changes their behavior from the moment they hit the cytoplasm. The higher diffusion rates would, one would think, greatly increase the chances of these compounds finding their targets (and likely the doses needed to achieve that as well).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s really something for us drug-hunting types to think about, because we sure do make a lot of drugs with basic functional groups on them. It seems that we would (other things being equal) be better off not using those, but unfortunately other things aren&#39;t equal all that often. Basic groups such as piperidines, piperazines, morpholines and others are often key binding motifs in the active sites of drug targets. But it&#39;s good for us to be aware of their effects on compound behaviors in the cytoplasm, and to keep our eyes open for chances to mitigate them if we can.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/drugs-inside-cells-bit-light</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/drugs-inside-cells-bit-light</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 12:23:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>HPV Infections: Friend and Foe</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Biology as we find it is full of Chesterton&#39;s Fence situations. That&#39;s an analogy that gets trotted out in a lot of political and regulatory situations, but we&#39;re dealing with it because we have arrive to sentience and technological agency after several billion years of evolution. I.e., the party has been going on for quite a while before we walked in the door. There&#39;s no better way to explain the idea than to go to the man himself, since G. K. Chesterton generally wrote in a peculiarly vigorous and quotable style:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot; style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&quot;In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, &quot;I don&#39;t see the use of this; let us clear it away.&quot; To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: &quot;If you don&#39;t see the use of it, I certainly won&#39;t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;This paradox rests on the most elementary common sense. The gate or fence did not grow there. It was not set up by somnambulists who built it in their sleep. It is highly improbable that it was put there by escaped lunatics who were for some reason loose in the street. Some person had some reason for thinking it would be a good thing for somebody. And until we know what the reason was, we really cannot judge whether the reason was reasonable. It is extremely probable that we have overlooked some whole aspect of the question, if something set up by human beings like ourselves seems to be entirely meaningless and mysterious. There are reformers who get over this difficulty by assuming that all their fathers were fools; but if that be so, we can only say that folly appears to be a hereditary disease. But the truth is that nobody has any business to destroy a social institution until he has really seen it as an historical institution. If he knows how it arose, and what purposes it was supposed to serve, he may really be able to say that they were bad purposes, that they have since become bad purposes, or that they are purposes which are no longer served. But if he simply stares at the thing as a senseless monstrosity that has somehow sprung up in his path, it is he and not the traditionalist who is suffering from an illusion.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see what I mean about the prose style! The man is full of stuff like this - some of it is tremendous and some of it is bizarrely wrongheaded, but it&#39;s mostly expressed as if his pen were a magical flaming sword. For that technique applied to fiction, try his &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3ZIuzOL&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Man Who Was Thursday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything else quite like it. But you can also see what I mean about evolutionary biology, because there is a lot of bizarre stuff in there once you&#39;re able to unpack the details. Of course, the user&#39;s manual and annotations are, well, unavailable, so we have to work out what we find on our own. Some things turn out to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholinesterase&quot;&gt;wildly&lt;/a&gt; well-optimized (and some of them that look &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuBisCO&quot;&gt;stupid and clunky&lt;/a&gt; turn out actually to be wildly well-optimized, too). Others aren&#39;t quite so impressive, but have hung around because they at least don&#39;t do any harm (or not enough to matter for fitness in passing on genes to the next generation). And some of the processes and solutions seem to be hung together in weird, bizarre ways that are absolutely alien to how Anyone Else Woulda Dunnit, but are with us because they worked (even if they were often repurposed from something else entirely), and they worked a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time ago, and they are now imbedded deep into the machinery. It&#39;s kind of like how there&#39;s still some &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL&quot;&gt;COBOL&lt;/a&gt; code inside a lot of huge business and financial systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case in point: the relationship between humans and human papilloma viruses (HPVs). There are a lot of those (over 200!), because we&#39;ve been evolving together for an extended period. It is safe to say that every human being on earth &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus_infection&quot;&gt;is infected&lt;/a&gt; with a whole list of these, and the process starts immediate after birth. Broadly, they divide into alpha and beta types, with the alphas infecting mucous membranes and the betas infecting skin epidermis. Several of the alpha types are (famously) associated with some types of cancer - the great majority of all cervical, vaginal, and anal types, some oral, head-and-neck, and others. And this is why the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPV_vaccine&quot;&gt;HPV vaccines&lt;/a&gt; are such a wonderful idea: they protect against a number of the viral types most associated with the cancers mentioned above. A dramatic example of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/human-papillomavirus-hpv/cervical-cancer-plummets-after-hpv-vaccination-scotland-rising-disease&quot;&gt;showed up recently&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to records of the Scottish national health service. Their vaccination program began in 2008, and so far the women who were vaccinated as 12- or 13-year-olds have shown &lt;em&gt;not one single case of cervical cancer&lt;/em&gt;. And the rate in women who were vaccinated at later ages was 80% lower than the unvaccinated. Cervical cancer is almost completely preventable through such vaccination programs, and the anti-vaccine activists who have come out against them (such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/note-robert-f-kennedy-jr&quot;&gt;dangerous fool&lt;/a&gt; nominated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/rfk-jr-and-what-we-re&quot;&gt;to be&lt;/a&gt; secretary of HHS) can go to hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about the beta-HPV types? Well, as mentioned, we all have them. Estimates are the babies are infected almost immediately by their parents, since these viruses are spread by skin contact. There&#39;s been &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7165336/&quot;&gt;a lot of argument&lt;/a&gt; over their roles in various types of dermal cancer, and you have to wonder if it could be worthwhile to develop a vaccine against some of the beta-HPV types as well if we can firm up some of those linkages. (It should be noted that the association of the various HPV-alpha types with cervical cancer and the like is far more glaringly obvious from the data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/abstract/S1535-6108(24)00448-3&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s a new paper&lt;/a&gt; that makes the story more complicated. First off, that beta-HPV vaccine idea has a big problem with it: it turns out that the beta-HPVs already set off much more of an immune response than the alpha- ones (which is why you need to stimulate the immune system with a vaccine towards the latter in the first place). Immunocompromised individuals can start to have skin problem with beta-HPVs, but a functional immune system seems to hold them down completely. That&#39;s the compromise we&#39;ve struck over evolutionary time: the beta-HPVs spread all they want, infecting the entire human race, but they don&#39;t do much once that happens. (Remember not to assign agency or forethought to these things - viruses are not trying to make you sick or give you cancer. They&#39;re trying to reproduce and spread and everything else is downstream of that, and will only be noticed, evolutionarily, if it shows any effect on reproductive fitness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because we&#39;ve all been infected all the time with beta-HPV types, more stuff has grown up around that situation. One of the things that keeps these viruses from doing anything else in the cells is surveillance by p53 (one of the key abnormal-cellular-behavior regulatory proteins). You can lose p53 protection several ways, and for the skin, a key one is damage from the ultraviolet part of sunlight. This new paper (a collaboration between Harvard, Louisville, and Mass General) shows that such p53 ablation allows the beta-HPV to start reproducing and taking over the cellular machinery, &lt;em&gt;and that triggers an immune reponse&lt;/em&gt;, preventing clonal expansion of the mutated cells. The lifelong presence of bHPV ends up being a surveillance system for skin cancer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all works because of the ubiquitous nature of bHPV infection and its strong immune-response profile: the minute it starts to poke its head up (by increased levels of viral antigen proteins presented on the cell surfaces) it&#39;s a sign that something has gone wrong with the normal order of things. What&#39;s more, it appears that actinic keratoses (known to be a form of precancerous lesion) actually seem to have &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; bHPV levels, which could imply that this monitoring mechanism is then disrupted and that cancerous cells have a better chance to spread in these tissues as opposed to normal skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, then, is a fence against skin cancer. Unlike Chesterton&#39;s example, it is not even recognizable as a fence at first, and we have to get to that step to even start on the rest of the discussion. But we should be alert for more of these with the typical commensual viruses and bacteria that we all carry - after all, we&#39;ve been together for a long time, and a lot can happen!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/hpv-infections-friend-and-foe</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/hpv-infections-friend-and-foe</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:17:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Ripping Through The Crystal</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.4c01429&quot;&gt;This is another&lt;/a&gt; one of those tales that could only be told with the advent of modern analytical methods, for sure. I&#39;ve written about micro-electron diffraction several times on the site, and that&#39;s the starting point for this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In traditional diffraction methods for solving the structures of crystalline compounds, you of course &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_diffraction&quot;&gt;use X-rays instead&lt;/a&gt;, an idea that is over 100 years old and earned &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_von_Laue&quot;&gt;Max von Laue&lt;/a&gt; a well-deserved Nobel. He and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Peter_Ewald&quot;&gt;Peter Ewald&lt;/a&gt; (also a founding father of this whole field) had discussed the idea of crystals diffracting electromagnetic radiation, and von Laue realized that X-rays might have the appropriate wavelength for that to occur. An experiment showed that it could indeed happen, and as von Laue related, he was walking home from the lab after this historic first run when the mathematical relationships between the scattering angles of the X-rays coming out of the crystal and the orientation and spacing of the planes of atoms inside it suddenly hit him! He was right on target, and X-ray diffraction became an extraordinarily useful way to go from &quot;I have a crystal of something&quot; to &quot;Here&#39;s what the actual molecules that make up that crystal look like, complete with their three-dimensional shapes and how they are fitted together&quot;. You can see where the enthusiasm comes from!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last century this technique has just become more and more powerful - the size of the molecules you could apply it to went from things like sodium chloride to entire gigantic protein complexes thanks to improvements in the brightness and coherence of the X-ray sources, the sensitivities of the detectors on the other end of the crystal, and the algorithms and processing power available to deal with the resulting data. The structural data from XRD has been a fountain of Nobel prizes and profound insights into biology, chemistry, materials science and more. I love the stuff - I am very far from being a crystallographer, but I have tremendously enjoyed the time I&#39;ve spent setting up crystals myself and interacting with the field&#39;s real practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all that said, x-ray diffraction has its limitations (don&#39;t we all). The crystal used has to be above a certain size to get reliable data out of it, and naturally it has to be of a reasonable quality as well. And it can be very hard to grow decent-sized crystals of many substances that aren&#39;t full of invalidating defects and impurities. That&#39;s where the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_diffraction&quot;&gt;electron diffraction&lt;/a&gt; comes in. Electrons will be hitting your crystals with even shorter wavelengths than X-rays (depending on how much energy you put behind them), and they interact with the atoms therein in different ways as well. The idea of shooting electron beams at-and/or-through samples was realized in the late 1920s and early 1930s by several groups in Germany who were working on the early electron microscopes (and who left behind such a messy situation in the associated documents that assigned credit even now is a fraught undertaking).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electron diffraction was observed with those early instruments, but the field needed a lot of technical improvements over the decades for ED to become a useful technique. The more recent advent of cryo-electron microscopy as a structure-solving technique (cryo-EM) has led to a real bloom of electron diffraction work for molecular structures, because many people realized that the instruments they were purchasing were most of the way towards being practical ED machines as well. When things go well, you can get useful structures (using similar algorithmic treatments to those used for X-ray crystallography) on far smaller crystals that XRD is usually able to work with, and this area has been advancing rapidly in the last ten years or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&#39;s a price to be paid for zapping your precious crystals with savagely bright X-rays or electron beams: you are not going to be able to use them for anything else afterwards (and in some cases, as with X-ray lasers, small ones may not even exist after the beam hits them). Irradiation causes a lot of damage, as one can appreciate, and it&#39;s been a race between the brightness of the beams and the abilities of the detectors to collect enough data for the algorithms in the limited time a crystal can be exposed. And that&#39;s where the paper linked above (from a team at UCLA) comes in. Rather than just treating such radiation damage as a necessary annoyance, the authors lean into it and ask what it can do for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.zdrx36m/rss/dewarbenzenes-1734378494800.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.zdrx36m/rss/dewarbenzenes-1734378494800.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In this case they&#39;re using crystals of a &quot;Dewar benzene&quot; derivative. Those are alternate structures that fit the same empirical formulae as &quot;regular&quot; benzene, but they are not aromatic (in the chemical sense!) and they are highly strained. But they exist (in many cases), and can transform back to their lower-energy benzene cousins if given the right push (which can be light, chemical reagents, or. . .a beam of electrons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.zdrx36m/rss/crystalrearrangement-1734378494800.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;Yep, the authors take crystals of the Dewar benzene compound shown at right and subject them to an ED beam, and note that the diffraction spots that it generates completely disappear within seconds. That&#39;s because the electrons are hitting the molecules therein and causing them to rearrange, and this process is capable of spreading to a nearby Dewar benzene molecule once it&#39;s done (the radical cation that is formed reacts with such a nearby molecule, which leaves another radical cation after the rearrangement, which reacts with another nearby molecule, etc.) By careful experimentation (varying the intensity of the beam, the exposure time, the temperature, and so on), the team has shown that a single electron can set off a chain reaction that transforms up to 90,000 Dewar benzene molecules before it terminates out. That termination could be at some electron-donating impurity, or perhaps occurs through radical-radical bond formation; it&#39;s not clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you can degrade crystals of the &quot;regular&quot; benzene isomer 2 with an electron beam as well, but loss of diffraction takes a lot longer (at least 90 seconds), showing that the damage in that case is more chaotic and not amplified by a chain reaction. You can readily solve the structure of isomer 2 by ED under more or less normal conditions, whereas getting a structure of 1 by ED takes some very careful handling with a low-intensity beam (the authors show that it can be done, and note that it&#39;s only possible with recent advances in detection and processing). By contrast, you can solve the structures of either isomer with X-ray diffraction, which doesn&#39;t set off the radical chain reaction in the crystals of compound 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this annoying-decomposition thing can, in some cases, be the start of a defined chemical reaction. It&#39;ll be interesting to see what other applications this might have, and if there are compounds that are otherwise difficult to access that might be achievable through some sort of toppling-domino arrangement that&#39;s set off by an electron beam. Even if it doesn&#39;t find wide use, I find it (paraphrasing Samuel Johnson) remarkable that it can be done at all!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/ripping-through-crystal</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/ripping-through-crystal</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2024 12:37:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Real High Throughput Chemistry Through Mass Spec</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to highlight a couple of papers that illustrate the long-running world conquest of mass spectrometry methods (and I for one have long welcomed our mass spec overlords). The number of useful variations that can be worked on this technique is a continual source of amazement, and there&#39;s no reason to think that it will stop any time soon. Both of the papers mentioned today are aiming at analyzing a large number of chemical reactions simultaneously, with the goal of speeding up organic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c11037&quot;&gt;This paper&lt;/a&gt; from a team at Purdue is notable because the reactions are taking place &lt;em&gt;during the mass spec process itself&lt;/em&gt;, i.e., in the charged microdroplets produced by electrospray ionization. There&#39;s been a huge amount of work in recent years on the unusual reactivities that are seen in small water droplets at the air/water interfact, and many of these ideas apply even more to the deliberately charged ones produced during electrospray. The authors combine starting molecules with nucleophilic groups (hydroxy, amines, etc.) with various electrophilic reagents and then use desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) mass spec on the mixtures. The nucleophile-electrophile reactions are accelerated in the microdroplets enough for the products to be detected by their mass signatures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same idea is used for multistep reactions (reductive amination via imine formation followed by borohydride reduction), epoxide formation via MCPBA acting on alkenes followed by nucleophilic opening, and more. You can screen through these multistage operations by mass spec as well, only following through on the ones that show reactions in the first step by their mass spec signature. The overall speed of analysis looks to be about one reaction mixture/second, which will certainly allow you to plow through a great many screening reactions. The authors note that of the twenty reaction types they examined, only three of them needed any incubation time - the others just relied on the rate acceleration from the electrospray droplet conditions. The authors say that &quot;&lt;em&gt;. . .any subsequent evaluation of drug analogs can be easily carried out by directly translating such conditions to product collection approaches using microdroplet reactors&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, and I am looking forward to seeing if that can be realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08211-4&quot;&gt;second paper&lt;/a&gt; uses an ingenious application of fragmentation patterns to monitor reaction mixtures. This is of course how mass spec proteomics is done, determining protein sequences by the predictable patterns of their breakups under the mass spec conditions. The authors here are asking &quot;Why not apply that to small molecules as well?&quot; The universe of small molecule structure and chemical behavior is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; larger than that of protein sequences, but it&#39;s a worthy goal to reach for. The paper studies the fragmentation behavior of synthetic intermediates such as TIDA boronates, with special attention paid to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.waters.com/nextgen/us/en/library/application-notes/2023/application-of-neutral-loss-and-precursor-ion-scanning-by-tandem-quadrupole-mass-spectrometry-to-monitor-for-drug-metabolites-in-in-vivo-and-in-vitro-samples.html?srsltid=AfmBOoq4xvXipVD6YGSHDdtNYPdsCH838FyKdUl-EfOfyqZpbzOhGlz6&quot;&gt;neutral loss&lt;/a&gt;&quot; mass spec analysis, in which things are set up to detect loss of a common species across all analytes in the sample. It turns out that TIDA boronates almost always lose an 86 Dalton piece (methacrylic acid), and a scan through unrelated molecules suggests that this fragmentation is quite diagnostic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with that in mind, you can use mass spec analysis to rip through a large number of metal-catalyzed coupling conditions (catalysts, additives, solvents) to see which ones cause the TIDA coupling partner to disappear most thoroughly. And if you have such a TIDA group in your molecule, you can go on to monitor other reaction types (reductive amination, amide formation, etc.) by using it as a detection handle. The paper goes on to show how this approach can be generalized to &quot;fragmentation first&quot; analysis - there are many other compounds (and compound classes) that show unique and useful fragmentation signatures that can in turn be used for reaction monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also multiplex this stuff: the paper demonstrates this with 96 aryl amines reacting with 8 halo-TIDA boronates, which gives you 768 potential products. They ran each of these pairs under 16 different conditions, which gives you 12,288 reactions across thirty-two 384-well plates. These reaction wells were then redistributed (acoustic liquid dispenser) into a single 1536-well plate with 8 reactions piled into each well, and the neutral loss MS analysis allowed all of these to be checked in 32 minutes. The paper goes on to demonstrate several other applications of this same workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, mass spec rules, and it looks to go on ruling. The Olympic motto is &quot;&lt;em&gt;citius, altius, fortius&lt;/em&gt;&quot; (faster, higher, stronger), but the mass spec motto is clearly &lt;em&gt;citius, minorius, accuratius&lt;/em&gt;: faster, smaller, more accurate. The limits of those qualities have yet to be reached.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/real-high-throughput-chemistry-through-mass-spec</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/real-high-throughput-chemistry-through-mass-spec</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2024 09:56:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>PPAR Binding Strikes Again</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Some years ago I spent time working in the nuclear receptor field, specifically the PPAR subtypes. It&#39;s a complex area, as we all discovered (there were a number of companies working in it at the time), and one of the lessons that I took away very quickly was that whoever imported the GPCR terms &quot;agonist&quot; and &quot;antagonist&quot; into the nuclear receptor field should be tarred and feathered. Those are useful terms for G-protein coupled receptors, although there are complications in them the minute you start looking more closely (partial agonists, inverse agonists, and the list goes on). But nuclear receptors are just a different thing altogether. Their signaling pathways just do not fit what we think of when we use agonist/antagonist nomenclature, and I am completely sure that it has confused people far more than it has ever helped them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.99782&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; illustrates that point, and the point about nuclear receptor complexities in general. It&#39;s looking at the best-studied of the PPARs, PPAR-gamma, and specifically at the actions of two covalent compounds (GW9662 and T0070907) that are labeled as &quot;antagonists&quot;. Now, in a GPCR world, that would mean that these compounds bind to the active site of the receptor in a way that blocks agonist compounds from coming in and setting off the intracellular signals that the receptor is wired for. But what does it mean in a protein like PPAR-gamma, whose binding site is notoriously roomy and whose downstream signals span a huge range, depending on which protein cofactors associate with it after compound binding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.selleckchem.com/products/gw9662.html&quot;&gt;catalogs&lt;/a&gt; you&#39;ll see that GW9662 is listed as just that sort of thing: an &quot;antagonist&quot; that &quot;prevents activation of PPAR-gamma&quot;, and the chemically similar T007097 gets the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medchemexpress.com/t0070907.html?srsltid=AfmBOoqZPlcI6IkP-pfwQhHDDdjmWoWY3lkG64ecgMmbPF3UkmuaAK1c&quot;&gt;same sort of descriptions&lt;/a&gt;. What this new paper (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/43320&quot;&gt;previous ones&lt;/a&gt; from the authors) shows, though, is that these two compounds (which do indeed modify a particular Cys residue in the binding pocket) can bind at the same time as natural PPAR-gamma ligands (of which there are several), and in doing so move them over to an alternate binding region and shift the subsequent signaling into new pathways. In this paper they&#39;re looking at what happens when you pretreat PPAR-gamma with one of these two covalent compounds and then add in some of the known synthetic PPAR ligands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s quite a landscape! It turns out that each of the synthetic ligands can still bind PPAR-gamma (it&#39;s not that the covalent &quot;antagonist&quot; occupies the site and pushes them out of being able to bind at all). And each of them is capable of doing that in a different way! Some of them get moved over into a different region (as seen with the natural PPAR ligands), and some of them actually come in and shove the covalent compound aside into a different conformation to get into their &quot;usual&quot; binding site (!) Overall, the model is that if there&#39;s no ligand at all, the PPAR-gamma protein is in an equilibrium between two general conformational state - one where its helix 12 is buried over by the binding pocket which makes the whole think transcriptionally repressive, and another transcriptionally active one where that same helix 12 is exposed to solvent. If you add T007097, you slow the rate of exchange between those two states (both the active and repressive ones have longer lifetimes). On the other hand, treatment with GW9662 also slows the exchange, but shifts the equilibrium to give you more of the active state at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you first bind T007097 and then come in with another synthetic &quot;agonist&quot; molecule, what happens (by NMR evidence) is that the repressive conformation just disappears completely (!) The ligand-binding domain can&#39;t access that helix-12-buried conformation any more with both molecules present, and it gets stuck in the transcriptionally active mode. There have been many signs that something like this could be happening, but this is the most detailed biophysical evidence yet. Unfortunately, as is so damn often the case, the literature has not caught up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our findings may have profound implications as these GW9662 and T0070907 have been used in many published studies as covalent inhibitors to block ligand binding to PPARγ to test for binding and functional specificity in cells. As of May 2024, more than 1900 citations referring to ‘GW9662 or T0070907’ are reported in PubMed. Nearly 1000 of these publications were published in 2015 or later, after the original report that GW9662 and T0070907 are not effective inhibitors of ligand binding (Hughes et al., 2016), yet many in the field continue to use these compounds as covalent inhibitors. Our findings strongly suggest GW9662 and T0070907 should not be used as antagonists to block binding of other synthetic PPARγ ligands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also strongly suggest that we expunge the &quot;agonist&quot; and &quot;antagonist&quot; nomenclature from the whole field, but it&#39;s too late for that, isn&#39;t it? With nuclear receptors it&#39;s just not so simple as &quot;antagonist blocks agonist, stops signaling&quot;. It&#39;s not even always that simple with good ol&#39; GPCRs, but it&#39;s really wildly misleading with nuclear receptors. I was ranting about this topic in off-puttingly-annoyed tones back in like 2005, and I wasn&#39;t alone, either, so it&#39;s not too thrilling to see these issues still throwing people off here in 2024. Better late than never, though! Get a clue, nuclear receptor labs. Please, please get up to speed. The literature on these things is a trackless swamp, and we need to do better.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/ppar-binding-strikes-again</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/ppar-binding-strikes-again</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 01:23:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Bad Bar Graphs</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I hadn&#39;t seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.20.609464v2&quot;&gt;this preprint&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03996-w&quot;&gt;this &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt; called my attention to it, but it&#39;s certainly worth a look. The authors have gone back over the recent biology literature (3387 articles from 2023 in 15 high-profile journals) and they find that 88% of these use some sort of bar graph to present data. And I can well believe it! But unfortunately, about a third of those have presentation mistakes in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two most common mistakes are (1) not starting the Y axis at zero and (2) log-scale problems. In general, the first of those will tend to make differences between two data sets look larger than they really are (because you end up &quot;zooming in&quot; on the top of the actual bars), and the second will tend to make them look smaller (since you need much more of a change to show up on a log-scale plot). The authors found that the log-scale mistakes cause more distortion than the axis-zeroing ones, and I can believe that, too, since presenting data in logarithmic space can get out of hand pretty fast.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what it&#39;s worth, the journals with the most visualization problems were &lt;em&gt;Nature‬‭ Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;‬‭,‬‭ &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;‬‭,‬‭ &lt;em&gt;Science Translational‬&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;‭Medicine&lt;/em&gt;‬‭, and‬‭ &lt;em&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/em&gt;. That last journal seemed to make mostly axis-zeroing mistakes (&lt;em&gt;Nature Plants&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; had a similar pattern), while the other leaders were more evenly divided, except for &lt;em&gt;Nature Cancer&lt;/em&gt;, which stood out as the only one of the 15 journals that had a solid preference for log-scale mistakes. I don&#39;t know if we can draw many conclusions from all that, since this is only one time period&#39;s worth of data (i.e., perhaps other years might have other winners - well, losers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors provide a useful flow chart of advice in their Figure 2C about using bar graphs (and when to avoid them). There are situations where they&#39;re the appropriate way to show your data, of course, but not when you&#39;re reaching for things like a nonzeroed y axis. Their Extended Data Figure 2 presents the same example data set presented in a number of different formats, most of which are distortions and should be avoided. It&#39;s not that bar graphs are inherently misleading or that log axes are, either: but either one of them can be misleading when misapplied, and it&#39;s very easy to misapply them even if you&#39;re not actually trying to hide anything. Sticking with these principles would improve the literature, but I&#39;m world-weary enough to think that if the authors revisit the same journals in (say) three years they will find the same problems occurring at similar rates. I hope I&#39;m wrong!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/bad-bar-graphs</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/bad-bar-graphs</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 01:49:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Infant RSV Vaccination Trouble</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Respiratory Syncytial Virus (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_syncytial_virus&quot;&gt;RSV&lt;/a&gt;) is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/jpids/article/13/Supplement_2/S103/7641088&quot;&gt;major public health issue&lt;/a&gt;, but its damage is concentrated at the two ends of the age spectrum: infants and older adults. It&#39;s a common virus for all ages, but once out of early childhood the symptoms are much less severe for adolescents and adults (because they&#39;ve been almost always infected before as children!) But in the elderly population it can and does cause trouble again and can lead to outright pneumonia, which is in general still a major cause of death at those ages. Almost all children get it before the age of two, and the younger the exposure, the greater the chance of more severe respiratory illness. So overall it would be very beneficial to give a long-lasting vaccine as early in life as possible (with boosters in old age).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it has been very, very difficult to get to that point. RSV vaccination in children had a famous setback in the 1960s in trials using a chemically-inactivated-virus vaccine candidate. Infants who were vaccinated with this candidate actually ended up far worse off when they encountered wild-type RSV in what was later believed to be a case of one type of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/antibody-dependent-enhancement&quot;&gt;antibody-dependent enhancement&lt;/a&gt;. Readers will recognize that topic from several posts during the worst of the pandemic! ADE occurs when a vaccine (or a real pathogen) produces a response of non-neutralizing antibodies in a person&#39;s system, which lead to more efficient infection and spread when the pathogen is encountered again. This vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) is exactly what you &lt;em&gt;don&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; want, and it&#39;s one of the major things that you watch out for in vaccine development. (It does indeed &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC368388/&quot;&gt;seem to happen&lt;/a&gt; in real RSV infections in human children, too, although the 1960s vaccine definitely seems to have been worse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you would figure, this is a particularly severe issue when vaccinating infants or young children, because if their first exposure to these antigens results in these harmful antibodies you have set things up for severe trouble. It was not until 2023 that two vaccines were approved for RSV, and both of those are approved only for the adult population (older patients and the immunocompromised) and not for infants. As it stands now, infants at high risk for RSV can be given an antibody for protection, although this requires multiple doses, or the mother can make sure to be vaccinated while pregnant (which &quot;passive immunization&quot; technique passes her antibodies along to the infant for protection during the earliest weeks of life). But there is no outright RSV vaccine for infants or children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it doesn&#39;t look like there&#39;s going to be one for the foreseeable future. The developers of the existing (and potential) RSV vaccines have been stepping very carefully into younger patients, and it appears that an alarm bell just went off. Here, via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/action/alexander-a-tin.bsky.social&quot;&gt;Alexander Tin&lt;/a&gt; of CBS on BlueSky, is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/media/184301/download&quot;&gt;FDA&#39;s briefing document&lt;/a&gt; for an RSV safety advisory committee meeting coming up later this week. It looks like Moderna&#39;s trial in infants showed a noticeabe increase in severe respiratory disease in babies from 5 months up to 8 months old - about 26% of the vaccinated infants with symptomatic RSV progressed to more severe disease, versus 8% in the placebo control group. This was noted back in July, and the study was immediately put on hold. Moderna announced in September that the entire Phase I trial was being discontinued. (Their RSV vaccine for adults, however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-approves-modernas-rsv-vaccine-its-second-marketed-product-2024-05-31/&quot;&gt;did get FDA approval&lt;/a&gt; earlier in 2024, albeit after showing lower efficacy than the competing Pfizer and GSK vaccines in clinical trials).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The briefing document goes into detail on these problems with the trial, and it also says that &quot;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Currently, enrollment of children &amp;lt;2 years of age and RSV-naïve children 2 through 5 years of age is on hold for all clinical studies of RSV vaccine candidates under U.S. IND&lt;/em&gt;.&quot; It goes on to ask the committee what would be needed to get things going again, and what areas we need more understanding in (early safety signals and so on). It doesn&#39;t look to me like any early-childhood RSV vaccines are going to enter testing any time soon, much less make it to approval but we&#39;ll see what the committee recommendations are.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This isn&#39;t good news, obviously - it would be far better if we could just prevent the most common of cause severe respiratory illness in infants with a simple shot. But it&#39;s not going to be as easy as that, sadly. I&#39;m just glad that things were set up to notice very quickly that thing were going off the rails, once again. Immunology, folks, is hard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/infant-rsv-vaccination-trouble</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/infant-rsv-vaccination-trouble</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2024 02:45:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The BioSecure Act Falters?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/biosecure-act-moves-along&quot;&gt;last exciting installment&lt;/a&gt;, the BioSecure Act (which would prevent Federal agencies from doing business with a number of Chinese biopharma service companies) had passed in the House of Representatives and moved on to the Senate. And there it has run into some dead ends. The latest news is that the bill&#39;s language was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; included in a big must-pass defense omnibus bill (the &lt;span&gt;US National Defense Authorization Act), which is the route that many thought it could take to becoming law. And this is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biocentury.com/article/654396/biosecure-compromise-in-the-works-fate-uncertain-as-deadline-nears&quot;&gt;after reports&lt;/a&gt; that attempts at compromise language to get it through had been going on. It had definitely been diluted along the way even to get to this point, with longer timelines, possible waivers, and a statement that Medicare reimbursement would not qualify as doing business with a Chinese firm for the purposes of the law. Shares of WuXi and other companies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/wuxi-firms-surge-on-slimmer-chances-of-us-biosecure-passage-11733719911656.html&quot;&gt;jumped sharply&lt;/a&gt; on the news, and analysts seem to think that the bill is likely not going to make it through at all this year. Probably the only chance is if it makes it in some form into a continuing resolution on spending, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-trade/2024/12/09/ndaa-text-snubs-china-trade-hawks-00193208&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; that the Speaker of the House still wants to get something like this done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But if that doesn&#39;t happen, well, the whole process will have to start again in the next Congress. You can look at that from several perspectives: one might be that the new administration might be interested in the profitable angle of not introducing such provisions at all while not getting the government involved in more regulations. But then you have rhetoric from their own proposed Cabinet appointees that makes it sound like they&#39;d like to hammer the evil drug companies to strike some populist poses as well. And you have the Chinese political angle, too - a revived BioSecure Act could be (or again be) dressed up in red, white, and blue as a national security issue. There&#39;s also the way that it&#39;s going to be difficult to get a lot of things through the House of Representatives at all for the next two years - it&#39;s been lost in all the huge amounts of noise over Trump&#39;s re-election, but the Republican majority in the House actually &lt;em&gt;narrowed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and they already had plenty of problems getting anything done before that. It&#39;s true that some of the most obstructionist members are no longer there, but the margin of error is very small indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If some last-minute compromise isn&#39;t reached in this session, my thinking is that we&#39;re probably going to see so much chaotic stuff in the next Congress that the BioSecure Act (or its successor) will be outshouted by all kinds of other concerns. There&#39;s always the chance this something like it will catch the fancy of people high up in the new administration and the whole thing will come roaring back to life, so you can&#39;t rule anything out. But if I had to bet, I would bet that this is going to evaporate.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/biosecure-act-falters</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/biosecure-act-falters</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 11:37:29 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Computational Care</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.mit.edu/2023/speeding-drug-discovery-with-diffusion-generative-models-diffdock-0331&quot;&gt;there was news&lt;/a&gt; about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01776&quot;&gt;new docking program&lt;/a&gt; for fitting small molecule ligands into proteins that used diffusion-based methods. DiffDock made a splash, and there was no small amount of hype around it - for example, that press release linked in the first sentence says that &quot;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;The model&#39;s unique approach to computational drug design is a paradigm shift from current state-of-the-art tools that most pharmaceutical companies use, presenting a major opportunity for an overhaul of the traditional drug development pipeline&lt;/em&gt;.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/action/a%20significant%20step%20forward%20in%20molecular%20docking,%20offering%20better%20accuracy,%20efficiency,%20and%20flexibility%20compared%20to%20traditional%20search-based%20molecular%20docking%20methods&quot;&gt;And one&lt;/a&gt; from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (a source of funding for the project at MIT) called it &quot;&lt;em&gt;a significant step forward in molecular docking, offering better accuracy, efficiency, and flexibility compared to traditional search-based molecular docking methods&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The pitch was that those traditional methods treat docking as a regression problem zeroing in on a single right answer, whereas the diffusion-based DiffDock is supposed to allow for a whole range of ligand ideas at once. This was said to lead to notably better results - I&#39;ll quote the MIT press release again:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not only is DiffDock significantly more accurate than previous approaches to traditional docking benchmarks, thanks to its ability to reason at a higher scale and implicitly model some of the protein flexibility, DiffDock maintains high performance, even as other docking models begin to fail. In the more realistic scenario involving the use of computationally generated unbound protein structures, DiffDock places 22 percent of its predictions within 2 angstroms (widely considered to be the threshold for an accurate pose, 1Å corresponds to one over 10 billion meters), more than double other docking models barely hovering over 10 percent for some and dropping as low as 1.7 percent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Perhaps you can see where this post is headed. Even earlier this year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://310.ai/blog/diffdock-for-drug-discovery&quot;&gt;there were reports&lt;/a&gt; that the program was not exactly an oracle of molecular docking. And there&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02889&quot;&gt;a new preprint&lt;/a&gt; out this week from Ajay Jain and Ann Cleves at Optibrium (in Cambridge, UK) and Pat Walters (a former colleague of mine, now at Relay in Cambridge, MA), and it has a detailed look at DiffDock&#39;s performance compared to a more traditional docking workflow (using &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3398190/&quot;&gt;Surflex-Dock&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schrodinger.com/platform/products/glide/&quot;&gt;Glide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://vina.scripps.edu/&quot;&gt;Vina&lt;/a&gt;, etc.. It does not go well for the diffusion methods. The authors find that standard docking protocols actually outperform DiffDock in every way. When the binding site on the protein is known, the difference is very large, and even when the binding site is unknown there&#39;s still an extremely significant gap in the number of accurate predictions and how close they are to reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the preprint highlights a major problem behind the DiffDock team&#39;s approach. As a training set, they used roughly 98% of the known small-molecule-bound structures in the literature, and reserved the other 2% to evaluate the program&#39;s performance as a test set. This is wildly inappropriate; a better balance would be in the other direction (more in the test set than in the training!) As the authors emphasize, bound structures are for the most part not random experiments from nature - they are chosen by humans (mostly medicinal chemists and the like, in industry and academia), and that choice extends to both the proteins that are being studies and to the structures of the ligands that are bound. That is, there are many structures available for well-known important druggable binding sites on well-known proteins, and when there are multiple ligand structures available for one protein they are often chemically related.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This means that training on 98% of the known structures means that your program has probably &lt;em&gt;already been exposed&lt;/em&gt; to very similar problems compared to the ones you&#39;re going to ask it to solve for you. In other words, the deck is stacked, as opposed to traditional docking programs where everything is treated every time from first principles. Clearing out the test examples where the answers were going to be extremely similar to the test set data caused DiffDock&#39;s performance to suffer hugely on the remaining hard problems. The same objection can be applied to the (non-diffusion-based) docking program &lt;a href=&quot;https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-021-00522-2&quot;&gt;Gnina&lt;/a&gt;, which also uses deep-learning assists and may well have memorized some of the answer sets already as well. As the authors say:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is possible that the DiffDock training procedure has learned an interesting encoding of a large set of structures of protein-ligand complexes. However, what it appears to be doing cannot be considered to be either “docking” or “identification” of ligand binding sites. The reported results are overwhelmingly contaminated with near neighbors to test cases within the extensive training set.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The key word here is &quot;appears to be doing&quot;. That&#39;s exactly the same situation with Large Language Models which appear to be answering your queries. What they&#39;re really doing is simulating a string of words that looks close to what an answer to such a query might look like, based on their training sets. As humans, we can&#39;t help but be impressed by what appear to be right answers, and we assume (consciously or unconsciously) that these answers were arrived at by similar processes to the ones that we use in our own brains. But this is nowhere near the case, and it makes us all easy to fool. For an example of this in recent LLMs that appear to be doing mathematical reasoning, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05229&quot;&gt;this preprint&lt;/a&gt; from engineers at Apple. No reasoning is involved, and the ease with which such system can be broken is proof.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This new paper closes with an extremely valuable set of observations on this field, and I urge everyone with an interest in computational drug design to read them. One of the key ones notes that with LLMs and the like that the main uses are to produce outputs that are &lt;em&gt;extremely similar&lt;/em&gt; to the sort of things that were found in the training set (which is why they can seem eerily prescient when dealing with natural-language queries). But the point of computational drug design is to deal with cases that are &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;. New proteins, new chemical matter. Copying from what we know already will only get you so far.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;But what about AlphaFold?&quot; That&#39;s a natural response to such a statement. I gave a presentation recently that emphasized that the &quot;language&quot; of protein sequence, structure, and function is a highly compressed one with a very limited set of characters. Indeed, from a Shannon-information-entropy standpoint (communication across a noisy channel) it&#39;s very impressive indeed, which is what a few billion years of get-it-right-or-die-off selection pressure will get you. As such, it&#39;s a great opportunity for a machine learning approach. But small molecules binding to proteins, that&#39;s a &lt;em&gt;very much&lt;/em&gt; larger and more varied space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, Jain, Cleves, and Walters have a point to make about what happens when new hyped methods like this one hit. I&#39;ll reproduce it in full, and I subscribe to every word of it:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publication of studies such as the DiffDock report are not cost-free to the CADD field. Magical sounding claims generate interest and take time for groups to investigate and debunk. Many groups must independently test and understand the validity of such claims. This is because most groups, certainly those focused primarily on developing new drugs, do not have the time to publish extensive rebuttals such as this. Therefore their effort in validation/debunking is replicated many fold. The waste of time and effort is substantial, and the process of drug discovery is difficult enough without additional unnecessary challenges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All too true.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There are some good reasons for this, and the biggest is that rings of these sizes are harder to form than the smaller ones (or the larger ones, too, perversely). A lot of study has gone into this topic, with Jack Baldwin&#39;s &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Logic_of_Organic_Synthesis_(Rao)/02%3A_Rules_and_Guidelines_Governing_Organic_Synthesis/2.01%3A_Baldwins_Rule_for_Ring_Closure_Reactions&quot;&gt;Rules for Ring Closure&lt;/a&gt;&quot; as a comparatively early and very influential contribution. Another classic in the field is &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ar00064a001&quot;&gt;this 1981 review&lt;/a&gt; by Illuminati and Mandolini of intramolecular ring closures as a function of ring size, and their widely reproduced Figure 1 (lactone closure rates) is shown at right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that five-membered lactones are the easiest to close (fastest rate) followed by the six-membered and then the four-membered. Seven-membered rings drop off pretty steeply, and then you enter the ring size Valley of Despair where things are very slow indeed (note that the Y axis is a log scale!) Entropy is a big factor, as intuited by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Ru%C5%BEi%C4%8Dka&quot;&gt;Leo &lt;span&gt;Ružička&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; back in the 1920s: the two reacting ends of the chain have to come close to each other, and the more floppy chain that&#39;s in between them, the lower the probability of this happening. There are a number of other forces at work, too, because the medium-sized carbon rings have several types of structural strain in them that get evened out as the ring sizes get larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you&#39;re going to make interesting compounds &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6420057/&quot;&gt;in this range&lt;/a&gt; - which have a greater chance, I should add, of being novel and patentable - you&#39;re going to want to avoid brute-force ring closure. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-024-01668-w&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; is a good example of what works instead: expanding an existing ring &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt;. There are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8905531/&quot;&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chinesechemsoc.org/doi/10.31635/ccschem.020.202000469&quot;&gt;reactions&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscatal.1c03711&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; that have &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jo9905064&quot;&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; over the years, but this looks like a particularly powerful one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.zma50p8/rss/ringscheme-1733418515817.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;You add two carbons via a functionalized glycine derivative (as shown in the scheme at right), which gives you several handles for functionalization. The ruthenium-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shvo_catalyst&quot;&gt;Shvo catalyst&lt;/a&gt; drives the insertion in the presence of an additive such as acetophenone or (even better) trifluoromethylacetophenone (it&#39;s an Ru-H acceptor in the proposed mechanism). The product can be turned into an alpha-ketolactam, with many other synthetic possibilities after that, or reduced to the lactam or all the way down to the aza-heterocycles. Alternatively, other functionality can be brought in on the glycine synthon and retained. The paper shows this working on a wide range of starting materials (including some pharmaceutical structures), and the reaction provide quick access to a lot of compounds that would otherwise be pretty annoying to prepare. More &quot;skeletal editing&quot; reactions are always welcome!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/rings-less-traveled</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/rings-less-traveled</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2024 11:19:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Now That&#39;s What I Call Disordered</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve written here many times about disordered proteins, those floppy fuzzballs that have outsized role in living cells. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/uses-disorder&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s an early post&lt;/a&gt;, and more are linked below. Their actions can be a challenge to a guy like me, merely a poor chemist from the hinterlands, because instead of having defined stuctures - folds and pockets like any normal protein - they (as the name implies) have no defined structure at all. There&#39;s not a good macroscale analogy handy to help me picture this. I keep ending up with rather exotic images like a long spaghetti noodle wobbbling around in free fall on the International Space Station, which takes more overhead than I like my analogies to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair to them, some of these disordered proteins (or disordered regions) do take on defined structures when they encounter a binding partner, and some of them can in fact take on a whole range of different ones in the presence of different partners. That&#39;s a bit alarming, but in the way that the biology of living systems is intrinsically alarming (&quot;You mean to tell me it can do &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;?&quot;) But the ones that really get me are the ones that remain disordered even in the presence of their biological partner(s), and I&#39;ve written about that situation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/alarmingly-functional-disorder&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/fuzzy-free-for-all&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me just this morning that I can make a connection between this situation and another oft-blogged-about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/fluorescent-tags-are-basically-never-silent&quot;&gt;topic&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/condensates-new-organizing-principle-cells&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, biomolecular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/inside-those-condensates&quot;&gt;condensates&lt;/a&gt;. Those are essentially phase-separated liquid droplets of proteins, RNA, and whatnot, and liquids I can deal with, mentally. I don&#39;t expect them to have defined structures - I mean, that&#39;s their whole thing. So it hit me that a disordered complex of two disordered proteins is a sort of liquid droplet &lt;em&gt;consisting of only two molecules&lt;/em&gt;. Somehow that makes it easier for me to grasp, but no warranty is expressed or implied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08271-6&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; really drives the point home about these disordered complexes. The authors are studying a whole set of protein-protein (or protein-peptide) interactions, from well-defined things (sometimes with a small molecule ligand involved) all the way to the total free-for-all described above. And at each step along this continuum, they prepared the complexes &lt;em&gt;but with one of the partners made up of D-amino acids&lt;/em&gt;. Yep, a completely enantiomeric protein compared to the natural order of things, and you will search long and hard to find examples of such outside of a laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they found was what you might have pictured, but it needed to be proven: the degree to which such mirror-image partners could bind their natural partners matched very closely with the degree of disorder in the resulting complex. That is, complexes with well-defined binding domains (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5589576/&quot;&gt;MCL1 and PUMA&lt;/a&gt;, an interaction important in regulating apoptosis) just fall apart when you turn one of the partners into an otherworldly D-protein. Whereas the ones that were known to be completely disordered (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29466338/&quot;&gt;prothymosin-alpha&lt;/a&gt; and the C-terminal of histone 1.0) just don&#39;t notice it at all. The enantiomeric protein is of course still disordered, so why not? And complexes that lie between these show the appropriately varying degrees of sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stereoselectivity, the authors conclude, seems to come along with the relative importance of the folding of the protein backbone. There are several interesting areas to explore, then, and one might be seeing if D-peptides (which tend to be rather biologically stable) could serve as drugs to target intrinsically disordered proteins &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Another line of thought goes back to origins-of-life studies: it might well be that protein-protein interactions were functionally feasible before life (or life&#39;s precursor!) became homochiral. Now that&#39;s going &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; back there! We&#39;ll see what comes out of this. . .&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/now-s-what-i-call-disordered</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/now-s-what-i-call-disordered</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2024 01:08:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Do They Even Bind?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54409-5&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; is the sort of thing that you don&#39;t see all that often, although perhaps we should. The authors are working in the (ever-larger) field of bifunctional molecules, and among the many examples of these in the literature are species called (by their discoverers) &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6984452/&quot;&gt;ATTECs&lt;/a&gt;, for autophagosome-tethering compounds. Instead of calling in the ubiquitination/proteasome machinery to degrade a target (as the by-now-well-known PROTAC molecules do), these are meant to engage another cellular clearance pathway, autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That one&#39;s a major waste disposal route - there are a lot of moving parts, but a common pathway (macroautophagy) involves putting things inside an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagosome&quot;&gt;autophagosome&lt;/a&gt; membrane capsule, which is then delivered to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome&quot;&gt;lysosomes&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-020-0141-7&quot;&gt;complete destruction&lt;/a&gt;. You can throw most anything into one autophagy pathway or another, from individual proteins all the way up to whole organelles. The group publishing on ATTECs reported finding small molecules that bound to a protein called LC3 that&#39;s key to forming those autophagosomes, and had a series of papers showing the bifunctionals with those on one end and target ligands on another could &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/cc/d1cc04661f&quot;&gt;degrade proteins&lt;/a&gt;. They &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8410765/&quot;&gt;extended that idea&lt;/a&gt; by putting on a targeting group that sequestered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41580-018-0085-z&quot;&gt;lipid droplets&lt;/a&gt; within the cell and apparently &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8726627/&quot;&gt;degrading&lt;/a&gt; them entirely, even in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15548627.2023.2220540#abstract&quot;&gt;animal models&lt;/a&gt; (which is really only something you&#39;d expect the autophagy pathways to be able to do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that was certainly interesting work. But the paper linked in the first sentence of this post has a bucket of cold water to throw: the authors note that many attempts have been made at finding such LC3 ligands without much success, and that &quot;&lt;em&gt;we found that thorough biophysical characterization, evaluation, cellular target engagement or cell-based controls for the developed ATTEC ligands were largely lacking&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. So they tried a whole list of them. But neither fluorescence polarization, NMR, nor calorimetry (ITC) assays showed any interaction between the reported ligands and their reported targets, although the known weakly-binding compounds (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novobiocin&quot;&gt;novobiocin&lt;/a&gt;) did reproduce. They went on to do cellular target-finding assays with two of the reported ligands, with lack of success. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c02001&quot;&gt;One of them&lt;/a&gt;, however, is a known spindle kinase inhibitor (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2844774/&quot;&gt;ispinesib&lt;/a&gt;), so that pathway certainly showed up in those pulldown assays, and the authors suggest that its anti-mitotic action could account for some of the effects seen in cell assays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&#39;s hard to explain all the published results that way, for sure. The new paper (which goes on to show some new fragment screens that suggest that the LC3 proteins and others in this pathway are indeed &quot;ligandable&quot;), ends up with a general call for higher standards in the field, having failed to come up with a general explanation for how a whole multi-year &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S295034772300004X&quot;&gt;multi-publication&lt;/a&gt; research effort on autophagy-targeting bifunctionals can go on with compounds that don&#39;t appear to even hit their stated cellular targets in the first place. I&#39;d like to know the answer to that one myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/do-they-even-bind</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/do-they-even-bind</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2024 11:30:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Fluorescent Tags Are Basically Never Silent</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone doing chemical biology work rapidly becomes familiar with what I&#39;ll call the Tagger&#39;s Paradox, after the quantum mechanical &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer%27s_paradox&quot;&gt;observer&#39;s paradox&lt;/a&gt;. That one is of course the problem that so many things that allow you to observe the behavior of tiny quantum-mechanics-driven systems can also end up perturbing them. Social scientists have a similar problem - telling people that they&#39;re part of a study to observe how they behave will inevitably change their behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s our problem, then: when you&#39;re working with proteins and other biomolecules, it can be very hard to observe them at all unless you &quot;tag&quot; things somehow, with a very common method being adding some sort of fluorescent group. You can see how that comes in handy: most mammalian cells generally do not go around emitting light on their own or in response to illumination by some particular wavelength. It can be and has been amazingly useful to have different parts of a cell or different species of biomolecules suddenly take on the ability to glow in green, red, blue, and yellow. There are of course technical problems to look out for - how bright or long-lasting such fluorescence is (which is a key influence on how low a concentration you can track), and whether you can &quot;wear it out&quot; or not by continued stimulation (photochemical bleaching), and so on. When it works right, though, you can see where your labled structures are, where they&#39;re going, and how they get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the biggest worry is always that sticking the fluorescent group on them will make them do things that they wouldn&#39;t otherwise do. Perhaps it will affect membrane penetration and transport mechanisms, or cause your labeled species to bind to things that it otherwise wouldn&#39;t. Even worse, perhaps it will interfere with binding and downstream mechanisms of the things it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to interact with. Maybe it&#39;ll make it notably more stable (or notably less!) than the unlabeled form. There&#39;s really no way to tell without running the experiment and being aware of all these problems, and trying to correct for them as much as you can. In general, I think it&#39;s best to assume that no fluorescently labeled species is likely to ever be an exact match for its unlabeled counterpart, so the best you can do is to try to make sure that you&#39;re not messing up the pathways that you care about the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.23.624970v1&quot;&gt;This new preprint&lt;/a&gt; is an illustration of the problem. The authors are studying biomolecular condensates, which I&#39;ve written about many times here over the past few years. These liquid-y droplets that separate out from the cytoplasm and other cellular compartments are clearly an important part of how living cells function, and it&#39;s one that for a long time did not get the recognition it needed. There&#39;s been an explosion of work in this area, and a good deal of it has involved using fluorescent labels to study the behaviors of such species. But what does that fluorescent labeling do to condensate behavior?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, quite a bit - at least in the example reported here, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Db=gene&amp;amp;Cmd=DetailsSearch&amp;amp;Term=851394&quot;&gt;yeast protein Dhh1&lt;/a&gt;. That&#39;s a key part of &quot;P bodies&quot; in yeast (processing bodies), which are indeed biomolecular condensates involved in RNA handling and metabolism. A lot of the condensates have vague names like that, because they were noticed over the years by microscopy and picked up nomenclature as various sorts of &quot;bodies&quot;, &quot;granules&quot;, &quot;speckles&quot; and &quot;punctae&quot; before people realized what they all had in common (reversible, controllable phase separation). Now there are a lot of types of condensate out there doing a lot of different things, but the ones that are full of proteins and RNA are known to be extremely important, and they&#39;ve been heavily studied. So this would seem to be a very relevant example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why it&#39;s disconcerting that tagging Dhh1 causes so many changes! Labeling it with the classic&amp;nbsp; GFP (green fluorescent protein), or a whole list of other such tags of various colors (mKate2, mVenus, mCherry, mNeonGreen, mRuby2 &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;) along with the commonly used polyhistidine &quot;His tag&quot; (not fluorescent but useful for purification) led to all sorts of stuff. With isolated proteins &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, the concentration needed to start condensation with the protein and added RNA varied significantly between several of these, and in both directions. The sensitivity to the amounts of added RNA varied as well, and the sensitivity to pH changes in the buffer also started changing after tagging. Importantly, many of these effects could be mitigated by spiking in smaller amounts of the fluorescently labeled proteins into the unaltered systems, but even then you have to be careful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to expression in cells, the first thing the team noted was the N-terminal tags mostly expressed similarly (with the exception of the notoriously recalcitrant mCherry), while C-terminal tags with the different groups had widely varying levels show up. The number of P bodies formed in the cells for the C-terminal tags were all over the place, too, and these differences persisted even after accounting for the changes in expression level. Dhh1 seems to be much less picky about having things stuck on to its N-terminus, but your own protein of interest is going to have to be checked out in turn. In the C-terminal tags, some of them led to P-body formation under conditions where the unlabled protein never forms condensates at all! Likewise, localization of the protein seemed to be affected as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And unfortunately, the &quot;spike-in&quot; idea did not carry over as well to the cell experiments. Even small amounts of added fluorescent protein could mess things up, and it looks like the authors were not able to come up with a solution to the problem. There may not be one. The conclusion is that fluorescently tagged condensate proteins are going to have to be evaluated very closely indeed, as are the results that have been reported for them so far in the literature. It&#39;s not that these results immediately have to all be assumed to be wrong, but it certainly means that you can&#39;t assume that they&#39;re all correct, either! This is a lesson that we get to learn again and again. . .&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/fluorescent-tags-are-basically-never-silent</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/fluorescent-tags-are-basically-never-silent</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 11:10:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Holiday Kitchen Synthesis Time</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.z2q106s/rss/pecanpiesmall-1732725439243.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;It&#39;s the day before Thanksgiving here in the US, which means that (as longtime readers know) I will be preparing a chocolate pecan pie, as I do every year. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/holiday-organic-synthesis-chocolate-pecan-pie&quot;&gt;The recipe is here&lt;/a&gt;, and I&#39;ve been making it the same way for nearly thirty years, so I think I can put this one in the &quot;reliable&quot; category. That&#39;s it at right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m also in charge of preparing the turkey around here - the menu is (pretty much as always) said turkey, stuffing (my mother-in-law&#39;s idiosyncratic but tasty recipe, involving bread cubes, apples, celery, onions, cranberries and pepperoni), Iranian rice (basmati, made with slivers of almonds and pistachios, orange zest, saffron, and zereshk, which are sour red dried barberries), mashed potatoes, turkey gravy, green beans with country ham added, pan-roasted Brussels sprouts, pearl onions with cream sauce and sage, and stuffed mushrooms. It&#39;s usually enough. We&#39;ve run close variations on this menu for many years now, so no surprises, I hope. Well, one time about twenty years ago we did unwrap the turkey out of the fridge and found that it had already gone bad, but that is now just in the &quot;Hey, remember that time&quot; category, fortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many already know, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascience.org%2Fcontent%2Fblog-post+recipes&quot;&gt;quite a few recipes&lt;/a&gt; here on the site (that link should call them up, albeit in no particular order). I tend to post those during the Thanksgiving/Christmas season, and I&#39;m thinking about what new ones to add this year. There will of course be &quot;standard blogging&quot; until later on in December, but not much after that except the occasional food suggestion!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope my US readers have a good Thanksgiving and weekend, and I&#39;ll see everyone again on Monday. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/holiday-kitchen-synthesis-time</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/holiday-kitchen-synthesis-time</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 11:10:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Cassava Saga Finally Ends</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I have written about Cassava Sciences several times on this blog over the years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/cassava-revisited&quot;&gt;most recently here&lt;/a&gt;. The short summary is that they are a small biotech with a new mechanism of action for Alzheimer&#39;s and other neurodegenerative disorders, one that came out of work at a lab at CUNY some years ago. So far that doesn&#39;t sound so bad, does it? We need new ideas in that field, and academia is where a great many of those ideas come from. But if you just turn one more page, everything goes to hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original papers from the academic group have been flagged for what appears to be faked data, and audits of their work showed huge problems. The early trials of a small-molecule drug (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simufilam&quot;&gt;simufilam&lt;/a&gt;) based on the work were compromised by all this, since some of the data were worked up by the CUNY lab (a fact that was not widely known at the time). The professor running that lab has since been indicted on charges of defrauding the NIH, and the SEC fined the company for stock manipulation around the data for the (supposedly at the time successful) Phase II trials, and two of its principal executives left under a huge cloud of suspicion. (One of them, it turns out, had stripped out a lot of the less-impressive Phase II data before the general public got a chance to see any results). You really couldn&#39;t ask for an uglier situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while all that was going on, a Phase III trial was underway, and it was accompanied by cries from many observers that it should be halted in light of the vast number of problems in the data that had taken things to that point. It wasn&#39;t, though. And it just read out. To no competent observer&#39;s surprise, the results were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/cassava-sciences-alzheimer-s-treatment-didn-t-meet-endpoints-in-study-shares-dive-update-f3a2f3c4&quot;&gt;completely negative&lt;/a&gt;. No effect whatsoever. The company has noted that the drug was safe, but damn it, so is lemonade and we&#39;re not trying to cure Alzheimer&#39;s patients with that while burning hundreds of millions of dollars of investor money. The entire simufilam story has been a complete waste of time, money, effort, and the hopes of desperate patients, and what&#39;s worse is that along the way there were so many big, bright, flashing warning signs that that&#39;s exactly what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at the comments sections to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/saga-cassava&quot;&gt;earlier posts&lt;/a&gt; on the subject, though, you will see some strongly worded opinions from the company&#39;s fans. I got even more of those in my email each time, including someone from inside the company. I was a shill, I was ignorant, I was in the pay of short-sellers, I was not telling the whole story, I needed to actually understand the subject matter, and so on. These folks are the ones holding the bag today, and I don&#39;t know who they will complain to now. If you want to read someone who was right early on about Cassava and who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/14/cassava-sciences-mild-alzheimers-patients-simufilam/&quot;&gt;never stopped&lt;/a&gt; being right all the way, that would be Adam Feuerstein at &lt;em&gt;Stat&lt;/em&gt;. He has written about them for years and has taken a lot more abuse for it than I ever have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although the US stock markets have been a tremendous financial engine that has provided funding to a long list of great ideas and made untold millions of people (big investors and small ones) more secure and wealthy along the way, it. . .well, it&#39;s also full of idiots. Why wouldn&#39;t it be? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/a-high-potential-bull-put-strategy-on-cassava-sciences/ar-AA1tWAxQ&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s someone&lt;/a&gt; from two weeks ago saying that &quot;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most signs point to SAVA experiencing little risk of significant volatility. Unless something changes between now and the next earnings date (expected in February 2025), it’s quite possible SAVA stock will face neutral or moderately bullish price movements&lt;/em&gt;&quot; and recommending a &quot;high potential&quot; options trade around the stock. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.benzinga.com/content/41682269/analysts-believe-cassava-sciences-now-has-300-upside-from-here&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; turns out to be a pretty accurate summary of the company&#39;s many problems, but the headline is all about how &quot;analysts&quot; see a 300% upside to the stock. Exciting! And here&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/down-83-93-4-weeks-143502592.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMgpEsCzvgFSvqV5LjqzM7u6GAOvRRYI_HLbKte2PITZsKuVv6JjUadM1mPPdUVA8w82Wfeo-L4xOKa7q_HPZRCdo0wYLJrvBL-WhOBzT7gN85arGzp4gHXQn5uFTRerDAIUdIytjV37jGRm20vh6pqBLy7Bq3Jznpyzhhgx23ii&quot;&gt;another one&lt;/a&gt; that says that there&#39;s been &quot;too much selling pressure&quot; and &quot;&lt;em&gt;. . .given the fact that it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts are majorly in agreement about the company&#39;s ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier, the stock could be due for a turnaround&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. Sure thing, dude. The &lt;em&gt;Hindenberg&lt;/em&gt; has better chances of a big comeback, but you do you. You&#39;ll note that many such glass-brained takes are due to treating stocks as wiggly lines on a screen instead of looking at what the companies involved are actually doing, but that&#39;s a very old mistake indeed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, there are Alzheimer&#39;s patients, and their families and friends. Who are still hoping for a drug that will actually help. There&#39;s the ones I feel the worst for in all of this, and the problem is, there are plenty of people ready to take advantage of them again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/cassava-saga-finally-ends</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/cassava-saga-finally-ends</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 11:48:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Vaccine Progress Against &quot;C diff&quot;</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn4955&quot;&gt;This is a neat application&lt;/a&gt; of mRNA vaccine technology from researchers at Penn and the Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia that might address a pretty widespread bacterial problem. Significant disruptions of the human gut microbiome, through disease or through antibiotic treatment can lead to a very unwelcome new status quo in the intestine: a takeover by the bacterium &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridioides_difficile&quot;&gt;Clostridioides difficile&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; known to its (many) non-admirers as &quot;C diff&quot;. It&#39;s a Gram-positive anaerobe that is found in small populations even in healthy colons, but if it gets a chance to bloom (due to other resident species being killed off or reduced), it can cause a wide range of problems. These range from very unpleasant diarrhea at the mild end to death at the not-so-mild end, and in between you can have patients who are fighting the stuff off for weeks, months, or longer. It&#39;s a major worldwide health problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as such, there have been many attempts to deal with it. Courses of antibiotics, as mentioned, are sometimes what leads to the problem in the first place, but you can always try knocking the &lt;em&gt;Clostridiodes&lt;/em&gt; down with another agent (these days, usually vancomycin, which should give you some idea of how nasty an infection this is). That sometimes works, and sometimes doesn&#39;t, and a good number of patients relapse into another round of infection after treatment (and indeed might continue to do so for years, sadly). And that&#39;s especially bad news because the severity tends to increase each time. Fecal microbiome transplants have been looked at as an adjunct to such treatment or as a standalone therapy, and the limited data so far look promising - but some patients flare into inflammatory bowel disease as a result of it, which is not what you want, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be far better not to get infected with the bacterium to start with, but that&#39;s not easy, since it&#39;s found in the environment pretty much all around the world. There have been a couple of attempts at developing traditional vaccines, but (to the best of my knowledge) none of these have actually been able to prevent human infection and have thus never progressed. The new paper linked above describes a combination mRNA vaccine that hits several targets at once: it has antigens from domains in the toxins that &lt;em&gt;C. diff.&lt;/em&gt; produces (&lt;span&gt;TcdA and TcdB), which is what the previous vaccines were targeting. But it also includes antigen domains from an important bacterial enzyme, Pro-Pro endopeptidase 1 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.febslet.2015.10.027&quot;&gt;PPEP-1&lt;/a&gt;). That one is involved in motility, adhesion to human tissues, and colony formation, and is considered a key virulence factor. And as the authors note, it has the additional advantage of being highly conserved across the numerous isolated strains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In rodent models, the team found that their multivalent vaccine produced a stronger immune response than the corresponding alum-adjuvanted recombinent protein vaccines, and that the potency did not diminish as you added in more targets (different sites on the toxin proteins and PPEP-1). One dose was enough to get a strong response to the toxins, but two were needed to get antibodies and T-cells specific to PPEP-1 as well. The vaccine seemed very well tolerated (no weight loss or other side effects noted), and the efficacy was truly impressive. When challenged with five times the LD100 dose of TcdA and TcdB toxins (that is, five times the does that kills all unprotected mice), the ones that had been vaccinated with recombinant protein antigens and no aduvant all died within 24 hours. The ones vaccinated with these antigens and alum as adjuvant had a 20% survival rate. But the ones that got mRNA vaccines against either toxin had &lt;em&gt;100% survival&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These results continued to the infection-challenge model, which as mentioned has been a difficult hurdle to clear. When presented with twenty times the lethal dose of live &lt;em&gt;C. diff.&lt;/em&gt; bacteria, the vaccinated mice again showed a 100% survival rate with only mild symptoms of infection. Now that&#39;s a vaccine! This model also showed that vaccination against PPEP-1 alone was not sufficient - you needed that &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the toxin antigens, but that combination was extremely effective. Another experiment looked at vaccination in mice that had survived one round of infection (similar to the situation in many human patients before a relapse) and found that the vaccine did indeed elicit a strong response. This is good news, because one of the effects of the bacterial toxins is to suppress mucosal immunity, an problem that this new treatment seems to be able to overcome. The immunity seems reasonably long-lasting as well, at least in mice: animals challenged six months after vaccination were still able to shake off lethal challenges with live bacteria.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To complete the picture, though, the team added an antigen to a protein called CdeM, which is found on the surface of &lt;em&gt;C. diff.&lt;/em&gt; spores. Like many bacteria, this one can alternate between free-living cells and a spore form that can stay dormant for extended periods, making long-term control quite difficult. This tetravalent vaccine led to even higher immune response than the trivalent one, and also was significantly better at controlling infection when the mice were challenged with bacterial spores rather than live cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Overall, this looks like a very promising vaccine candidate. The paper takes the story as far as eliciting immune responses in primates, but the next steps will be infection challenges in these animals and detailed safety studies. Those will need to include monitoring for what happens when you mount a durable immune response to a resident gut bacterium: can you get away with that without setting off other problems? The rodents in this study showed no signs of such trouble, but that will be a key thing to watch for as this work goes on. So far, so good, though! This seems to be the best shot against prevention of this problem that has yet been developed. Good luck to all involved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/vaccine-progress-against-c-diff</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/vaccine-progress-against-c-diff</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 01:31:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Thermal Shifts - All of Them</title><description>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/95595&quot;&gt;a rather startling paper&lt;/a&gt; for those of us who remember the earlier days of what are generally called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_shift_assay&quot;&gt;thermal shift assays&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. The idea behind these is that proteins have a certain amount of thermal stability, that they can hold something like their normal three-dimensional shape for a while as the temperature is increased. But eventually this gives way to a more &quot;melted&quot; (denatured) form where things start to come apart. If you have a ligand bound to your protein, though, the whole complex is almost always more stable than the unbound protein is, and thus the melting-point temperature will be higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use these to find new protein ligands and to rank them in order of their rough binding affinities, and the usual way this gets done is by the addition of some sort of dye that likes to bind to the hydrophobic surfaces of proteins. You pick one that will fluoresce under those protein-bound conditions but whose fluorescence is quenched by being out in aqueous solution - that way, the onset of the fluorescence is an indicator that the protein structure has started to unravel and that normally buried hydrophobic regions are now becoming exposed for the dye to stick to. There are a lot of variations on this theme, using different dyes, intrinsic protein fluorescence, modified target proteins, different sorts of instrumentation to read out the signals, and so on, but this is the general idea, and although there are several possible complications, it really works quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as chemical biologists all appreciate, it has the major advantage of working in cell lysates or in living cells themselves (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2014.138&quot;&gt;CETSA assay&lt;/a&gt;). That opens up the idea of using thermal shift for target ID when you find some small molecule with interesting activity but unknown mechanism of action, and the combination of the CETSA technique with mass-spec driven proteomics has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089619309174?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;really taken off,&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and you see all sorts of variations (such as monitoring changes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acschembio.2c00334&quot;&gt;real time&lt;/a&gt;). You&#39;ll surely miss some things due to detection limits and other factors, but you&#39;re able to find &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0388-4&quot;&gt;a lot of interactions&lt;/a&gt; that would otherwise be very hard to tease out. It&#39;s a real chemical biology bonanza when it works well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new paper linked in the first sentence of this post is an example of the state of the art: the authors are using a recent modification (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00500&quot;&gt;PISA&lt;/a&gt;) that monitors protein solubility more than direct changes in the melting curves, a change that results in much higher throughput across large protein sets. And they really put the technique to the test, using 96 anticancer drugs and tool compounds of known mechanism in live-cell assays to see if this improved workflow can reproduce what we know about their targets (70 of these were also done in cell lysates). They quantified about 6800 proteins per run and even more in the lysates, and as you&#39;d imagine it took a while to tune things up to get the nonspecific binding noise out, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the end it seems to have worked quite well. The compounds generally showed clear signals for their known targets, although there were some interesting exceptions. For example, there were two compounds in the set that target the kinase AKT1: &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MK-2206&quot;&gt;MK-2206&lt;/a&gt; as an allosteric inhibitor and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4944842/&quot;&gt;CCT128930&lt;/a&gt; as a classic ATP-competitive one. The allosteric compound showed a clear solubility shift with AKT1, but the competitive inhibitor was almost silent. In addition, they were able to see all sorts of off-target interactions, particularly with the kinase inhibitors (which almost always hit some related enzymes along the way). For instance, the compound &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Otssp167&quot;&gt;OTS167&lt;/a&gt; showed responses with 154 proteins! Meanwhile, PF-3758309 is annotated as a PAK4 inhibitor, but the this whole-proteome screen unexpected showed a lot of interactions with spliceosome proteins. There were also a number of compounds that showed a &lt;em&gt;decrease&lt;/em&gt; in complex solubility, but (fortunately) these correlated very well with effects that had been seen in more traditional CETSA assays.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The cell-lysate experiments turned out to be a valuable complement to the cell data, as with traditional CETSA, since some proteins are much more likely to show strong signals under one of those conditions and not the other, but with one major glitch: several compounds showed what appeared to be interactions with a huge number of proteins in the lysates, and this turned out to be an artifact (although the authors are still working out how!) Outside of that problem, hits in lysate assays are more likely to be from direct target interactions, while hits in the live cells can go on to show you protein-protein interaction networks that are disrupted in the lysates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So overall this technique seems to be doing what it was designed to do, and looks to be a solid way to search for mechnisms of action, off-target effects, and more at a scale (and speed) that has previously not been available. And this paper is a very useful comparison between &quot;classic&quot; CETSA and the newer PISA technique. There are going to be more refinements in things like the temperature range(s) used and the use of multiple compounds concentrations, but I think we can look forward to being inundated with more chem-bio data than ever before. For me, that&#39;s a feature!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/thermal-shifts-all-them</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/thermal-shifts-all-them</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Nov 2024 11:59:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Lab Motions</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I was at the bench yesterday afternoon (yep, I still have a hood, and I still make some compounds - mostly weird stuff that I would feel bad asking someone else to spend time making!) And while isolating and purifying a couple of new probes, it occurred to me that there are a lot of muscle-memory tasks that I&#39;ve built up over the years that are nearly unconscious for me by now. That shouldn&#39;t be a surprise, I guess - my first real &quot;research reactions&quot; were back in the summer of 1981 as an undergraduate, so one way or another I&#39;ve been doing lab work for over forty years now. Here are some of them; see if this ring a bell for some of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a lower solvent layer out of a separatory funnel, and letting the stuff on the sides &quot;catch up&quot; and go down to the bottom where the stopcock is (sometimes with a light swirl to get it moving). Then once the last bits are drained out, reaching up with the vial/flask/tube to the glass tip to catch that drop that&#39;s always hanging on up there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, using a Pasteur pipette to take one of the layers out of a small vial that has an organic/aqueous interface in it, and looking in the narrow tip region to see if there&#39;s a little zone of &quot;lower-layer&quot; stuff that I can carefully drip back out before adding the rest of the upper-layer-stuff to its separate flask. The other move is to pipet out the lower-layer solvent into its separate flask, slowing down near the end to avoid adding any of the separated upper-layer solvent that&#39;s now moving down the pipet tip. Takes some fine finger control not to overshoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening one of those disposable needles for a polypropylene syringe - peeling back the paper and then using a fingernail to get the plastic fitting of the needle itself to disengage from the safety covering it&#39;s fitted into. Putting it onto the end of the syringe and giving it a twist (necessary for the ones that have a threaded fitting down there, of course, but I do it even with the 1mL and 2.5mL ones that don&#39;t, to make sure it&#39;s on tight. And when taking solvent up in one of those green-plungered 1 mL ones, tapping the side of the barrel to get a stubborn air bubble to move to the top so I can read out the volume correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When pipetting out solvent from a drying layer of sodium sulfate at the bottom of the flask/vial, trying a couple of spots to see if I can draw up the solvent without bringing along a snowglobe&#39;s worth of the particles of the sodium sulfate itself. Often you can find a spot where the solid packs in a way that it acts as its own filter, and as long as you&#39;re not too sudden about it you can draw up a clean pipet&#39;s worth of solvent to transfer. Then there&#39;s the move where you seem to be unable to pipet any more out of the vessel, but a brief tap resettles the sodium sulfate and suddenly there&#39;s plenty more solvent you can bring up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transferring a sample to an NMR tube, where if you&#39;re like me you invariably put the tip of the pipette against the inner wall of the tube and let it run down, filling it up that way. I suppose the odds of inserting the pipette straight down to where it&#39;s not touching anything are lower, and there&#39;s no need to go to the effort of doing it that way! Afterwards, I always make sure that the little plastic NMR cap is on the tube more or less even - I think that some part of my brain thinks that it&#39;ll spin unevenly in the machine or something if it&#39;s tilted, although I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not an actual thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are movements that are probably particular to whatever analytical system your lab is using - over the last twenty years or so, a good example would be walkup LC/MS (which has of course utterly displaced thin-layer chromatography in almost all cases where it&#39;s available). There will be some sort of little vials (polypropylene or glass) that the system is built to handle, with various sorts of closures. Some screw on, others have a filtering plunger built into them that you press down, and others are simple press-and-snap plastic bits. Whichever type you&#39;re using, you&#39;re probably using a lot of them, though, and the distinctive motions of putting together the samples will be part of the rhythm of your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings up the motions that I used to know but haven&#39;t done in a long time, mostly to do with things like packing my own silica gel columns to do house-air-pressure flash chromatography separations. There was a whole set of actions that I performed God-only-knows how many times in the 80s and 90s, having to do with cotton wool in the bottom of the column, making a solvent slurry of the silica gel and pouring it, adding a layer of sand on top, and then adding my crude sample to the top of that once everything had settled down. Running one of those columns was a whole standardized set of movements, too, with one hand sometimes up on top pushing the air line fitting down (if it was a smaller column - larger ones I&#39;d use a metal clamp) and the other hand cutting fractions into vials or flasks of various sizes at the bottom at regular intervals. A trick I picked up in grad school (it was one of the Native Handicrafts of my group) was to use steel wire to make a bonded-together rack of vials for fraction collection, usually 5x5 in a sort of staggered diagonal-diamond shape. These were very handy for orderly column-running, since you had them all together in a form where the numbered was built in and nothing could be easily turned over. I had a whole collection of these at one point, several duplicates of several sizes of vials. You did have to take the fractions out one by one by pipette as opposed to taking test tubes out of a rack, but we didn&#39;t have luxuries like automated fraction collectors and thus no standardarized test tube racks to fit into them. You would just wash the whole vial assembly out with acetone or what-have-you at the end and leave it upside down to dry; I used the same ones for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biologists will of course have their own completely different repertoires of these things, and I invite descriptions from them and from other chemists below in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/lab-motions</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/lab-motions</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 11:05:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Down There in the Nano-Flow</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve often mentioned one of the biggest differences between the modern literature and the papers that I was reading while I was doing my graduate work (which era has now entered the Forty Years Ago zone for me, and yes, that does seem like some kind of a joke, although I&#39;ve definitelyheard more entertaining ones). That&#39;s the emphasis on the nanoscale, the things that happen in very small regions around surfaces and interfaces or around individual molecules. We&#39;ve always known that this is a different world than the bulk phases that we&#39;re used to, but only with time have we attained the technology needed to really study it and begin understanding it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.4c01094&quot;&gt;This recent paper&lt;/a&gt; is exactly what I mean. The authors are looking at the behavior of enzymes when the individual enzyme molecules themselves are physically confined in different ways. That sort of thing would have been mostly a hand-waving thought experiment Back In The Day, but over the &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0036024424030208&quot;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt; there&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2022/na/d2na00021k&quot;&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c01292&quot;&gt;good&lt;/a&gt; amount of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2013/cs/c3cs60234f&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; put into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-020-0652-2&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt;. As well there should be! It&#39;s been clear for a long time that one of the key features of enzyme action is this sort of bespoke single-molecule confinement, and it can produce extraordinary changes in reaction rates, pathways, and selectivities. But even with the tools we have in our hands now, it&#39;s not an easy place to make progress. Making these special tiny chambers and getting the desired molecules in and out of them is not a straightforward task, and we will need to get a lot better at it to accumulate enough knowledge to put these effects to our own uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper linked above is an attempt to make things easier. The authors use a multilayered reactor that has an enzyme (in this case alkaline phosphatase) immobilized to its surface, and its behavior in this state is characterized. Then a structured polymethyldisiloxane (PDMS) layer is pressed onto this substrate, and the &quot;microposts&quot; of the PDMS are allowed to stick to the glass. As the pressure on these layers increases, the microposts (originally 80 microns wide) spread out more and more, leading to tighter confinement in the remaining spaces. The behavior down there can be investigated by fluorescently stained molecules of lambda-DNA. At no extra pressure, these resemble the ones in solution, just floating around in a fairly compact state. But as the pressure is increased, the DNA becomes more and more linear, which is similar to behavior observed previously with fabricated nanoslits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the enzyme reactions, a solution of substrate is introduced that will generate an insoluble fluorescent product on cleavage. The paper first shows some simulations based on the confinement size, diffusion rates (in both dimensions) around the immobilized enzymes, and the effects of various changes in reaction rates, concentration of substrate and insoluble product, and so on. Using 15-micron microposts spaced 15 microns apart, the &quot;non-pressed&quot; state strongly resembled the solution reaction (just as with the fluorescent DNA behavior). But under pressure, the reaction rate of the enzyme reaction was substantially increased under the posts, with the fluorescent substrate seen (by confocal microscopy) to be especially accumulating under the edges of the posts )lining the microchannels). (Meanwhile, the reaction on the umasked parts of the surface, out in the open channels, was suppressed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing the size of the microposts and their spacing led to a number of changes in the reaction rates and the spatial distribution of the insoluble product. For example, increased the size of the microposts to 40 microns or larger (with the same size/spacing ratios as before) led to what the authors describe as &quot;donut-shaped&quot; distributions of product - the reaction was enhanced around the edges of the squeezed-down posts, but suppressed in the middle of them (probably due to diffusion limitations). They could get the same behavior with the smaller microposts by increasing the substrate concentration. In fact, you can do good ol&#39; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaelis%E2%80%93Menten_kinetics&quot;&gt;Michaelis− Menten&lt;/a&gt; enzyme kinetics on these various zones, with different numbers for affinity and reaction rate coming out as if they were different enzymes entirely. Similar results were obtained with a horseradish peroxidase system, suggesting that the local rate enhancements under confinement may well be a general phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is not a very complex tool, but it&#39;s a useful one to get a picture of what&#39;s happening down there, and it has the substantial advantage of being easy to modify through the patterning of the PDMS layers. From the discussion section, though, you can see that the authors would like to try some other systems and other polymers, which certainly seems like the natural next step. There are possible applications in nanosensing devices with these adjustable rate enhancements, and there&#39;s plenty of basic science to learn about what enzymes are capable of under these conditions. Squeeze away, I would say.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/down-there-nano-flow</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/down-there-nano-flow</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 12:54:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>CNS Drug Development: Same As It Ever Was</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: the day after I published this post, Sage announced that their Huntington&#39;s candidate (SAGE-718) failed to hit its endpoints in its clinical trial. That might be the end.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve written a few times over the years about Sage Pharmaceuticals, because they&#39;ve been trying some interesting ideas in the antidepressant field, which is a very, very hard place to make headway. It&#39;s been quite a ride. They initially had some interesting (but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/four-patients-count-em-four&quot;&gt;statistically underpowered&lt;/a&gt;) results for post-partum depression, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/sage-therapeutics-time-some-real-numbers-now&quot;&gt;kept at&lt;/a&gt; that indication long enough (to their credit) to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopregnanolone&quot;&gt;their drugs&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-oral-treatment-postpartum-depression&quot;&gt;the market&lt;/a&gt;. They&#39;ve been working in the area of steroid-derived compounds that affect CNS receptor signaling, and why not? We don&#39;t have a very good understanding at all about what goes on at the neurochemical level in things like depression, and I think that all sorts of stuff is worth a shot. It&#39;s a terrible problem with vast amounts of that unmet medical need that we all go on about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sage pushed onward, trying to get their lead compound (and analogs thereof) through the clinic against &quot;regular&quot; major depression, and that&#39;s where things ran into trouble. A pivotal trial &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/another-shot-major-depression-fails&quot;&gt;failed to show&lt;/a&gt; benefit, and they had several other clinical failures as well. It should be noted, for those outside the industry, that this smaller-indication/bigger-indication strategy is a common one. There are many situations where you have a better chance of showing benefit (and thus a better shot at FDA approval) in a more niche indication with a smaller patient population, so you may want to go for that first to gauge your chances even if that market by itself is not going to make you a biopharma juggernaut. You&#39;ll have already done a lot of the preliminary work needed to move on to a bigger indication during that first approval, and you may well have more insights into dosing, dose tolerances, and other factors when you go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those bigger indications (like major depression) tend to have a more heterogeneous patient population, and a lot of these disease areas are have such great opportunities in them for what are (sadly) very good reasons. It&#39;s hard to get stuff to work! In this case, it&#39;s at least possible that post-partum depression is a somewhat better defined thing than Depression In General, which (like many other CNS problems) may well turn out to be several distinct problems that all manifest with broadly similar symptoms. Schizophrenia is another shining example of this, and getting something to work there is a heavy lift, too. At any rate, Sage was never able to really show efficacy, and according &lt;a href=&quot;https://endpts.com/a-rare-neurological-disease-is-sages-last-best-hope-after-failures-in-depression/&quot;&gt;to this piece&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Endpoints&lt;/em&gt;, is now facing some tough times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have a clinical trial readout in Huntington&#39;s disease later this fall, and man, that&#39;s a tough place to make your stand. Like all the neurodegenerative diseases, Huntington&#39;s has been a horrendous place to do drug discovery in, but at the same time, anyone who actually gets something to work will have the market pretty much to themselves. It&#39;s not where I would want my company fighting a read-guard action to keep going, though, I can tell you that. As the article notes, the company has already adjusted their primary endpoint for the trial, and the drug itself has already failed two other trials. This is a 75-yard heave into the end zone, everybody who can be an eligible receiver get down there sort of play.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Zurzuvae had apparently succeeded in a Phase II trial in depression, but before it failed its Phase III, Sage&#39;s stock was over $180/share in 2018-2019. It&#39;s now in single digits. If the latest neurosteroid fails against Huntington&#39;s, it&#39;s going lower than that and the company&#39;s future is very much in doubt. Central nervous system drug development is definitely for the brave.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/cns-drug-development-same-it-ever-was</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/cns-drug-development-same-it-ever-was</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 01:49:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>On RFK Jr. And What We&#39;re In For</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone will have heard the news from last night that president-elect Trump intends to nominate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to be Secretatry of HHS. I have already made my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/choice&quot;&gt;feelings known&lt;/a&gt;, many times, about our next president (in short, that it would be almost impossible for me to have a lower opinion of him) and I have already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/note-robert-f-kennedy-jr&quot;&gt;made them known&lt;/a&gt; about RFK. Jr. In short, I think that he is a fool and a demagogue whose positions on key public health issues like vaccination are nothing short of disastrous. He is often described in the press as a &quot;vaccine skeptic&quot;, but that&#39;s far too forgiving: he is outright anti-vaccination, and putting such a person in such a position of responsibility is going to get people killed. There&#39;s no use in pretending otherwise, and first in line will be babies and children. It&#39;s disgusting and horrifying and what makes it all worse is that (1) it doesn&#39;t have to be this way and that (2) we, the citizens of this country, have done this to ourselves by our own electoral choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let me change gears here. I could go on for pages about the things I brought up in that paragraph, but that would be &lt;em&gt;a waste of my time and energy and of yours&lt;/em&gt;. People, we are going to have to pace ourselves. It&#39;s only been ten days since the election, and I speak from the heart when I say that it has truly been one damn thing after another the whole time. Trump&#39;s cabinet nominees have included some of the absolute worst selections in the history of this country, a parade of vile, mendacious, blowhards like Matt Gaetz &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. They are a huge collective middle finger to any expectations of expertise or competence, and you have to believe that that&#39;s completely by design. After watching this, don&#39;t pretend to yourself that the incoming administration won&#39;t do (&lt;em&gt;insert huge stupid bad decision here&lt;/em&gt;), that they didn&#39;t mean it, or that they denied that they would do it and that promise will hold. They &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; mean it. And there&#39;s plenty more to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember Trump&#39;s first term: there were tennis balls going in all directions and fireworks igniting at all hours of the day and night. This sort of stuff is supposed to infuriate the people who are paying attention and eventually wear them out. Of course, there are going to be some people who are just delighted with the Leader and his Wonderful Ideas, and there is definitely a population like that here in the US. But the real-world ideal for an autocrat is a population that mostly just shrugs and says &quot;Yeah, sure, whatever&quot;. The larger that cohort is at the start, the better (and the number of people who just didn&#39;t bother to vote is a good place to start measuring), but you also want to exhaust the people who disagree with you and make them just throw up their hands in despair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s why I&#39;m advising people not to lose it over the RFK nomination just yet. We have over a month before Trump even gets inaugurated, and a lot can happen. The Senate will have to confirm him and the other losers that Trump has nominated, for starters, and if you want to take a health reading on our political institutions that would be a good place to start. Outright rejections for some of these Cabinet posts would be at the high end of that scale, while acquiescing to some sort of adjournment scheme so Trump can just recess-appoint people for the next two years without any hearings at all would absolutely be at the low end. Some of these nominations might in fact be trial balloons to see just how the Senate reacts and what the administration feels that they can get away with. And even if (for example) Kennedy gets in as HHS Secretary, he will find that the much-hated administrative state and federalism itself will make it difficult for him to rule by decree in the way he&#39;s talking about. They are &lt;em&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt; to make that difficult. How well these things hold up will be another measure of the country&#39;s health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this administration, no matter what, is going to be an absolute carnival of incompetence and corruption, full of people scrambling for money and power and damn the consequences. That ugly spectacle might actually work to the country&#39;s advantage, because a filling a bottle full of scorpions is not a good model for getting things accomplished. There are a lot of very big egos being packed into a small space so far, a lot of people who simply cannot work together. But unfortunately even the best outcomes that I can think of still end up doing a lot of damage. Many, many hard-working and capable people are going to be fired or just quit from all kinds of positions where we&#39;re rather have kept them. Many worthwhile programs are going to be gutted. It will take many years to get over this, no matter what, and we&#39;d all better go ahead and get used to it and work up some mental and emotional fortitude to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, of course, nominating RFK, Jr. is a catastrophically bad idea. But there are and will be a godawful lot of those in the next four years. I cannot allow myself to shout and rant about every single one of those at every stage. Just look at this particular nomination itself - how many times did we hear over the past few weeks that yes-he-will, no-he-won&#39;t, yes-he-wants-it, no-he-doesn&#39;t, so-and-so confirms the rumor but so-and-so categorically denies it. Noise! So much noise, and lies, and confusion. Steve Usdin at &lt;em&gt;BioCentury&lt;/em&gt;, you can tell, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biocentury.com/article/654203/&quot;&gt;went through this exact process&lt;/a&gt; and got plenty of smart, confident, well-placed insidery denials that this nomination would happen at all. But again, if you allow yourself to become totally outraged every time there&#39;s something that under normal circumstances would be worth being totally outraged about, you&#39;ll never make it. Because these aren&#39;t normal circumstances. Slow down. Take a deep breath. Take some time to work out what the most efficacious thing you can do about any given outrage might be and when might be the best time to do it, and where it ranks next to all the others. I will be following this advice personally, so don&#39;t expect to see rapid reactions here to every single hideous thing that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re going to need our energy, our stamina, and our hope for better things to make it out of all this intact, because there&#39;s going to be a lot of work to do after this is over. Keep working steadily to make sure that it does indeed pass. Be strong, and stay strong. Despair is a sin, and it&#39;s counted as one for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/rfk-jr-and-what-we-re</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/rfk-jr-and-what-we-re</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2024 09:58:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Natural-Ish Product Motifs</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.4c00811&quot;&gt;This paper&lt;/a&gt; looks over the recent years of clinical-phase drug structures from a viewpoint that many of us may not have considered. How many of them incorporate structural features found in natural products? NPs themselves are an indelible part of drug discovery history (salicylic acid, morphine, penicillin, and similarly obscure compounds over the decades), and it&#39;s no wonder: these things have had eons of selection pressure applied to them for all sorts of reasons. When you see specific and complex small molecules that living creatures are going to the metabolic trouble to prepare, there are surely survival-linked functions behind them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several concepts in the literature that bear on this idea, such as the idea of &quot;pseudo-natural products&quot;, new compounds prepared by combining various NP chemical motifs, and &quot;natural product likeness&quot;, the attempt(s) to measure how chemically similar given compounds are to known NPs. You can definitely have arguments about what looks like a natural product and what doesn&#39;t and what constitutes a natural product fragment. But when you dig into the topic, you start to realize that a lot of our widely-used motifs really do go back to the NP world - substituted piperidines, pyrrolidines, and piperazines, a great many nitrogen-bearing heterocycles (pyridines, quinolines, indoles, and various azoles). In this paper, the authors divide things out into a few categories: natural products themselves (NPs), natural-product-like (NPL) compounds, with the same connectivity as one or more natural products but with different substituents, pseudo-natural products (PNPs) that contain natural product fragments linked together in ways not found in nature, and then everything else that&#39;s fully synthetic and not related to the NP world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.ziiki9f/rss/pnps-1731620232307.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;Looking over the decades, there are some interesting trends. What you see is a gradual decrease in outright natural products in the clinic, and an overall decrease in the natural-product-like ones that are generally just derivatives of compounds in the NP category. But the pseudo-natural-product category has been growing steadily, and at the expense of the non-natural-product-like category all the way (as it would have to, since by this point these are really the only two categories of any consequence). This balance shift is not seen when you measure reference compounds in the literature, though, suggesting that activity in the clinic is a strong selector for some sort of natural product heritage. Interestingly, though, a straight calculation of chemical &quot;NP-likeness&quot; shows a small but steady &lt;em&gt;decrease&lt;/em&gt; over these periods: we&#39;re borrowing pieces from the natural product world, but the compounds we&#39;re making with them don&#39;t look very much like what Nature itself comes up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these numbers are explained by the ascent of kinases as a therapeutic class, because the heterocyclic motifs often found in the kinase inhibitors all make those compounds count as PNPs. It&#39;s worth noting, though, that neither kinases nor GPCR ligands have shown much PNP enhancement over the years, but that&#39;s probably because they started out high already! And that example illustrates another effect, the &quot;recycling&quot; (as the authors put it) of compound types and particular pieces. That&#39;s a longstanding med-chem tradition, and for good reason - as Sir James Black famously put it, &lt;em&gt;&quot;The most fruitful basis for the discovery of a new drug is to start with an old drug&quot;.&lt;/em&gt; The modern advent of the huge catalogs of functionalizable fragments and synthesis-on-demand libraries of them can no doubt add to these effects too, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugs are where you find them, and this is where we are apparently finding them. The authors here note that there are still many under-used natural product fragments waiting for their time in the sunshine and suggest that these would be good regions to explore in compound libraries, and it&#39;s hard to argue with them. Make a few!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/natural-ish-product-motifs</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/natural-ish-product-motifs</guid><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 01:16:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Deuterium In Court</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Some years ago here on the site I wrote a series of blog posts about the idea of substituting deuterium atoms for hydrogens in drug structures (back when that was a new idea!) And that parenthetical phrase is the subject of today&#39;s writeup! The first deuterated drug was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/first-deuterated-drug-arrives&quot;&gt;approved in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, and there continues to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-023-00703-8&quot;&gt;lot of activity&lt;/a&gt; in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&#39;ll take a couple of paragraphs to explain why that is, for folks who don&#39;t think about kinetic isotope effects all the time (really, try it, it&#39;s fun). Deuterium is the first &quot;heavy&quot; isotope of hydrogen: instead of one proton as a nucleus with one electron around it, deuterium has a nucleus of one proton and one neutron (with again, one electron around it). That makes it possible to swap a D atom into a structure anywhere there&#39;s an H - the two isotopes do the same chemical reactions. Deuterium is completely stable and non-radioactive, as opposed to the next-higher hydrogen isotope, tritium (one proton and two neutrons), which is indeed &quot;hot&quot; and decays with a half-life of twelve years and four months. You can still put a T anywhere you can put an H, but you&#39;d better handle the new compound differently once you do!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;D-for-H is an almost imperceptible change when it comes to shape, size, polarity and other physical properties. The only noticeable differences between (say) a carbon-hydrogen bond and a carbon-deuterium one will show up in anything that involves stretching, bending, or breaking that bond. And that is completely due to the way that the C-D bond has a heavier piece out on one end of it than the corresponding C-H bond. This behavior can be modeled surprisingly well with just weighted balls and springs, no quantum mechanics required! Infrared spectra, for example, show absorbance peaks as particular bond types stretch and wag in response to those wavelengths, and the deuterated analogs show these same behaviors but at longer wavelengths (lower frequencies) every time, because you&#39;re moving a heavier weight around. Similarly, chemical reactions that involve breaking such a C-H bond will proceed a bit more slowly when breaking a C-D bond instead, and that effect has been used to great advantage in figuring out the details of chemical reaction mechanisms. And that turns out to be of great interest to drug development folks when you have a drug candidate that&#39;s getting metabolized and cleared from the body through enzyme actions that have to break specific C-H bonds! Turning those into C-D bonds can slow that down enough so that the deuterated compound now has higher blood levels and a longer half-life, while having the exact same actions on its targets in the body.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of slowing down metabolism and clearance through deuteration was slow to catch on - initially the reaction was &quot;Huh. Yeah, I suppose that could work, if you were sure about the exact spots to put the deuteriums and if you drug really needed just that extra boost. But who would go to the trouble?&quot; The answer turns out to be &quot;Lots of us!&quot; Entire small companies were founded on that idea as it caught on in the early 2000s, and these initially took advantage of the fact that up until then almost no one had thought of actually putting deuterated analogs into their patent claims. There was a gold-rush period that lasted a few years while the faster movers scooped up the IP for compounds that looked to be the most improvable, but that era has been gone for quite a few years now. Any competently drafted patent claims will include that language in them these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, patents. There was some question about whether the PTO would accept deuterated drugs as novel chemical matter at first, but they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/deuterated-drugs-pto-says-ok-so-far&quot;&gt;certainly did&lt;/a&gt;. But because of the requirements for novelty and non-obviousness in granting patents, ideas like this do have a certain shelf life, and that shelf life is determined by (you guessed it) case-by-case litigation. I had an email recently from a reader who was struck by how I predicted this back in 2013, but I can claim no prophetic powers, as illustrated by. . .by. . .(&lt;em&gt;waves hands around vaguely at the entire landscape of current events&lt;/em&gt;). But yeah, you can see these things coming on, just as with other bright novel-chemical-matter ideas like patents on pure enantiomers instead of racemates. Things start off novel, become justifiably popular, get incorporated into everyone&#39;s practice (in the lab and in the patent drafts), and then at some points are just obvious things to a Person of Ordinary Skill in the Art. As the phrase goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has that point been reached with deuteration? It may have. There was a Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decision last year (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions-orders/19-2011.OPINION.8-22-2023_2178325.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sun v. Incyte&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that was labeled &quot;nonprecedential&quot;, but even so, the reasoning behind such actions can inform later judicial decisions. Sun bought out one of the pioneer companies in the deuteration world (Concert Pharmaceuticals) in 2023, and carried on full speed with Concert&#39;s attempts to get approval for a deuterated version of the JAK inhibitor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruxolitinib&quot;&gt;ruxolitinib&lt;/a&gt; (sold by Incyte in nondeuterated form as Jakafi). If you look at the chemical structure of ruxolitinib, there&#39;s a cyclopentane ring hanging off of it, and any medicinal chemist will tell you that that&#39;s likely to be oxidative metabolism bait. Concert had made several poly-deuterated analogs in a bid to slow that down and give the drug better properties. Concert had already taken &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/concert-rethinks-r-d-plans-after-loss-incyte-patent-case&quot;&gt;an initial loss&lt;/a&gt; in front of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) in claiming that Incyte&#39;s patents did not cover the new-and-improved deuterated versions that they were developing, but that was a complicated decision that also involved the stated indications for the drug&#39;s use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the CAFC decision is the later chapter of that dispute. Incyte was fighting to have the Sun/Concert patent claims declared as obvious based on prior art, saying that a person of ordinary skill in this area would have known that such deuteration could be useful and that there was thus no inventive step in doing it. In fact, some of the prior art they referenced was background material from Concert itself, talking up the benefits of deuteration (the &quot;Concert Backgrounder&quot; mentioned in the decision). And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lifesciencesipblog.com/federal-circuit-reiterates-what-constitutes-a-motivation-to-combine-a-reasonable-expectation-of-success-and-unexpected-results-in-new-chemical-compounds&quot;&gt;Incyte succeeded&lt;/a&gt;. Sun was arguing that the patent board had made a series of mistakes in their earlier ruling, but the CAFC didn&#39;t buy any of their reasoning, and upheld the PTAB on every point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court applied a two-part test, but the first part was basically moot - that&#39;s the one where you decide if someone would have selected the original chemical matter as a lead for development in the first place, and both Sun and Incyte naturally agreed that yeah, the marketed drug was what you&#39;d have picked to modify. The second part was where the wrangling took place: would the prior art have motivated a person of ordinary skill in the art (a POSA) to have prepared the deuterated compounds with a &quot;reasonable chance&quot; of success? As you can probably imagine, there&#39;s been a lot of hair-splitting over the years about every bit of this language, and the current state of the art seems to be that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; expectation of success is considered reasonable, that you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/federal-circuit-finds-deuterated-1546034/&quot;&gt;don&#39;t have to have&lt;/a&gt; some high degree of predictability at the start but just example of such things having worked in some cases in the past. As a side note, that Sun buyout had already turned out to be messy enough for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/suns-concert-hits-bum-note-fda-imposes-partial-hold-2-months-after-576m-buyout&quot;&gt;other reasons&lt;/a&gt;, and even the attempted launch of the deuterated drug outside the indications claimed in the Incyte patent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/incyte-blocks-launch-sun-pharmas-jak-inhibitor-newcomer-leqselvi-alopecia&quot;&gt;just ran into an injunction&lt;/a&gt;, so it&#39;s been a huge mess for Sun overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it it looks like this deuteration view is a trend. A similar dispute arose between Alzheon and Risen (Suzhou) over deuterated forms of Alzheon compounds that showed up in a Risen patent. This was the subject of a review at the PATB which found that the key issue was indeed part two of that aformentioned two-part test, and that the deuteration was an obvious step. Risen tried appealing that decision to the CAFC, but they didn&#39;t even get as far as Sun did - the CAFC &lt;a href=&quot;https://alzheon.com/alzheon-announces-that-united-states-federal-circuit-affirmed-decision-of-u-s-patent-office-invalidating-risen-suzhou-pharmaceutical-technology-co-ltd-s-patent-on-isotopically-enriched-f/&quot;&gt;affirmed the decision&lt;/a&gt; without discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other such disputes cooking, naturally. One of them involves Vertex&#39;s cystic fibrosis drugs, because their current cocktail of three agents results in payments to Royalty Pharma. The drugs were originally partly funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, who sold their resulting interest in them to Royalty &lt;a href=&quot;https://tracs.unc.edu/index.php/news/1418-cf-foundation-cashes-out-on-kalydeco-in-3-3b-sale-to-royalty-pharma&quot;&gt;back in 2014&lt;/a&gt; for a cash payment of over $3 billion back in 2014. But now Vertex is developing deuterated versions of two of the three compounds in that cocktail, and the issue is whether those royalty payments will still apply. The two sides have &lt;a href=&quot;https://seekingalpha.com/article/4568881-royalty-pharma-attractive-business-model-uncertain-outcome-vertex-cf-royalties&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different opinions&lt;/a&gt; about that, and I would not be surprised to see this dispute end up in the courts if everything continues on this course. That would be Royalty&#39;s move to make, and it would be an expensive one. But at the same time, the recent CAFC decision makes one think that if some generic company wanted to try breaking those Vertex patents they might have a shot. How exactly that ties into the royalty contract is another layer of legal uncertainty, though - I have no idea how that reads or what the interpretations might be (are obvious-to-a-POSA compounds still paying out, or not?). But I&#39;ll bet that the folks at Royalty Pharma are out there rounding up some opinions on that right now.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/deuterium-court</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/deuterium-court</guid><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 10:05:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Eureka</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.4c00802&quot;&gt;This is a fun paper&lt;/a&gt; on &quot;Eureka&quot; moments, where chemists report on their own experiences of suddenly solving a problem. It&#39;s open access, so you can see for yourself how this has worked for the 18 interviewees. In some cases it&#39;s a sudden realization of the question that should be asked, rather than a sudden intuition about an answer. Some of the examples are very specific means of solving some long-running problem, while others are realizations about more general principles that in some case led to whole new areas of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s an odd book from the late 1980s, &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/4hNm4Ky&quot;&gt;Discovering&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;by Robert Root-Bernstein, that addressed this sort of thing at length. It&#39;s a deeply flawed book, not least because of its awkward dialogue-between-characters framing, but there&#39;s a lot of valuable stuff in it as well, much of which is distilled in the last chapter or two. Unfortunately, more than a few of the &quot;Rules For Discovering&quot; that get advanced are contradictory, which to be fair is a problem noticed by the characters in the book themselves. (He later wrote a sequel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3AP7f9n&quot;&gt;Sparks of Genius&lt;/a&gt;, which I have not read).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that comes through in both the book and the new article linked above is the diversity of experience in this area. Some people deliberately make time for activities that seem to lead to more chances for insight (long walks, showers, etc.) Others have been content to let these things hit them more randomly, although you do wonder of some of then have wondered about trying to recreate these experiences deliberately. One common experience is the feeling that some part of one&#39;s brain has apparently been working on a problem outside conscious awareness and that it&#39;s somehow reporting back with its results. But others describe what sounds very close to random chance - they just happened to read or see something that triggered the key insight. In these cases, it makes you wonder if that had they not randomly come across this cue that insight would have been lost, but my own guess is that fortune does indeed favor the prepared mind, and that something else would have done the trick soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of the paper linked above, I invite readers to submit any stories of their own sudden insights in the comments. Let&#39;s see if any patterns emerge. . .&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/eureka</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/eureka</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 10:58:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Peptide Stability</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoy papers &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acsptsci.4c00503&quot;&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt; - these are the ones that go after subjects that are at first look unglamorous, but they make you appreciate how little glamour has to do with good science. In this case, the authors are looking at peptide stability under biological conditions, which is a well-known topic (and a well-known problem!) We have tremendous abilities to generate, modify, and screen huge numbers of peptides, and there are more possible structures in that set of compounds than we could every possibly explore. And of course the list of bioactive peptides is very long and impressive indeed, so why not add to it for our own purposes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as drug discovery folks are well aware, one big problem is stability. Living systems are awash in enzymes and transport proteins that destroy and/or relocate all sorts of peptide structures, and that fits in with their common uses in many tissues: relative short duration, relatively local distribution. There are exceptions carved out by evolution, of course, and there are whole classes of larger proteins that have long-lived protected status (with antibodies being a prime example in the bloodstream). But smaller species, of the sort that might be better able to pass through membranes on their own, can have a very hard time of it. Their stability can be increased by chemical modification (either to make their peptide bonds more difficult for enzymes to cleave, or by introducing groups that will cause the whole molecule to stick to some other protein like albumin and evade destruction), and this sort of work takes up a big portion of drug development work in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper linked above examines several different assay techniques to look at peptide stability and half-life. There&#39;s a huge amount of such data running around, but (as is so often the case) much of it is not directly comparable. People run different assays in different ways, at different concentrations and in different buffers or with different cells, tissues, or animal models. For (ostensibly more simple) in vitro assays, people will generally incubate a test peptide in some sort of liquid assay (blood, plasma, cell lysate, purified enzyme, what have you) and then precipitate the proteins at the end of an incubation period to analyze them by LC/mass spec. But there are a lot of variations to be rung here, even in the seemingly standard steps like &quot;precipitate the protein&quot;, or when you want to start with some sort of label on your test substance (fluorescent or isotopic) to better quantify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors use a selection of various neuropeptide Y and ghrelin analogs, and they found a big source of variation just in the precipitation protocols from buffer solutions. Acetonitrile/ethanol seemed to be the most generally applicable method (and the one that lost the least sample), with trichloroacetic acid precipitation being notably inferior to it and the other solvent-based methods they tried. Moving on to treatment with blood plasma, they also illustrate that stabilities can vary according to &lt;em&gt;who donated the plasma&lt;/em&gt;. People who do pharmacokinetics measurements for a living will not be surprised to hear that, but folks that are further away from the clinic may not have appreciated it: the enzymes present in plasma and their concentrations can definitely vary from person to person, and one would be wise to take this into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying the test peptides out in cell supernatants instead of plasma led (for the most part) to longer half-lives, but not always. And the numbers varied a great deal according to the cell types used, as you&#39;d have to expect. If you&#39;re going to get meaningful data, you need to try a variety of them, and try to pick lines that are most relevant to your intended use (always keeping in mind though that cultured cells are generally a long way from their primary tissue counterparts). In the end, there&#39;s no substitute for real blood levels in real animals and real humans, and there never has been. But that&#39;s the most time-consuming and expensive way to do it, and the one with the lowest throughput!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper highlights another effect that you&#39;d hope that people would be aware of, but time has shown us (again and again) that often they aren&#39;t: labeling a peptide turns it into a different compound. With (possibly) different behavior in every way, including stability. It&#39;s probably more likely that attaching fluorescent labels will make the half-lifes longer as you interfere with enzymatic activities, but you need to confirm this by experiment. These effects were notable when degradation of an otherwise equivalent isotopically labeled peptide was compared to a fluorescently labeled one. Needless to say, your final therapeutic (if that&#39;s what you&#39;re going for) is probably not going to have a fluorescent tag on it. And for anyone that thinks that this is basic stuff that people don&#39;t need reminding about, I refer them to the GSK/Sirtris deal, $700 million dollars that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/speaking-illusions-sirtuins-and-longevity&quot;&gt;went down the waste tubes&lt;/a&gt; in no small part because of fluorescent peptide artifacts in the assays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as is so often the case, the lesson is: as few shortcuts as possible. Test everything from more than one direction and in more than one way, and make sure that you&#39;re seeing what you think you&#39;re seeing. Your biological systems are &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; more complicated than you would like them to be, and there are so many ways to get things wrong. Be alert!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/peptide-stability</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/peptide-stability</guid><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 11:56:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Choice Made</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Here, then, is the follow-up to my pre-election blog post, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/choice&quot;&gt;The Choice&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voting public did indeed make their choice known last night, both by casting their votes and (in other cases) by declining to cast any at all (there&#39;s always a substantial group out there that can&#39;t be bothered to get off the couch no matter what). At any rate, I&#39;m sure no one here will be surprised to hear what I think of the re-election of Donald Trump. This was an even worse experience than 2016, because back then there were still people who could treat the man as an unknown quantity and project their own desires onto him. But his behavior during his first term and afterwards - very much including this campaign - would seem to destroy that excuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we have to take into account that a significant number of his supporters either have never actually heard of some of his misdeeds (they don&#39;t get brought up on Fox News or similar sources, naturally), or believe that reports of them have been fabricated by his enemies, which is to say, their enemies as well. In the same way some of his voters don&#39;t seem to have bothered to hear anything much about his oft-stated plans for another term, while another cohort believes that it&#39;s OK, because he&#39;s not really going to do that stuff anyway. But those categories leave yet another group that knows a lot about what Trump has done and what he plans to do, and they &lt;em&gt;love the sound of it all and cannot wait&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m 62. There may not be enough years available to me to ever get over watching huge numbers of my fellow citizens voting so enthusiastically for a vengeful, ignorant, authoritarian asshole. My main hope for this upcoming presidency is that he will be too lazy and disorganized to realize many of his goals, or that his underlings will waste their energies fighting each other. But those are branches to hold on to. Perhaps the House of Representatives will (through some razor-thin accident) remain in Democratic hands, and perhaps the 2026 midterms will go against Trump and his party. That would be even more likely if he crashes the economy by slapping tariffs on everything, but then again, any difficulties that arise will no doubt be blamed on secret cadres of transsexual illegal immigrants or the like. Always those wreckers and saboteurs around, followers of Snowball, Goldstein, and other such subversives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stated goals of the new administration towards science and medical policy are (in my view) disastrous. But so are their economic plans and their foreign policy. I am going to get through these next four years somehow without being consumed by despair or constant rage. I will take refuge in my scientific pursuits, in my other interests, in the arts and in the natural world (lots of astronomy, lots of hiking, etc.) But if the administration remains on the courses it has announced, I will also remain in fierce opposition and will always be deciding on the best ways to move against its actions. I very much recommend Ken White&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popehat.com/p/and-yet-it-moves&quot;&gt;thoughts here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I will continue to write here, since that&#39;s definitely one of those interests! But I&#39;m sure it will not be too surprising if I take a few days off - I&#39;ll see everyone on Monday. It will take some time to recover from the immediate blow. I would compare this to the emotional aftermath of 9/11, except that event was not accompanied by cheering crowds while we attacked ourselves. The only thing I have to compare it to, then is the reverberating period after the death of a close family member. That&#39;s an awful analogy, but it does feel as if the country I grew up in is making a serious attempt at suicide. And this morning&#39;s returns made me feel as bad as I&#39;ve felt since that time I had to identify - as her last living relative - the body of my deceased mother. Yeah, it&#39;ll take a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/choice-made</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/choice-made</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 03:22:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Just How Lipophilic Is That Huge Thing?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;We drug discovery types spend a goodly amount of time thinking about the physical properties of our molecules, in hopes of getting an early read of how &quot;developable&quot; they will turn out to be as clinical candidates. Solubility, polarity, lipophilicity, melting point and more all bear on that issue, because you want your drug to dissolve easily, to stay in solution, to not be so greasy that it sticks to every membrane it sees and not so wildly polar that it goes sluicing straight out through the kidneys into the urine, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common measure of lipophilicity (greasiness) is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acdlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/download/app/physchem/making_sense.pdf&quot;&gt;logP&lt;/a&gt;, the log of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_coefficient&quot;&gt;partition coefficient&lt;/a&gt; for a given compound between water and n-octanol. For example, if a compound has a logP of 2, that means that it partitions between those two solvents in a 100-1 split between octanol and water, while a logP of 3 is a 1000fold split, and so on. You can have negative logP values if your compound would prefer to be in water, too, of course, but it&#39;s safe to say that most of the structures that we make aren&#39;t in that territory. In real-world practice, we mostly worry about not getting too excessively high a logP, although the cutoffs for &quot;excessively high&quot; are a matter of taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyone would agree that a logP of (say) 14 is indeed excessively high, a nice solid hundred-trillion-to-one ratio in favor of the greasy solvent over water. If you take the well-known macrocyclic compound &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin&quot;&gt;cyclosporine&lt;/a&gt; and calculate its expected logP (known as clogP, for &quot;calculated&quot;) with Daylight, a well-known tool for that job, that&#39;s the value you get, though (14.4 to be more precise). That&#39;s pretty interesting considering it&#39;s an effective drug, which you wouldn&#39;t expect from something with that high a logP. But if you actually go into the lab and measure the partitioning yourself (perish the thought), you get a value around 3, a perfectly reasonable value for a drug substance. What&#39;s a difference of eleven orders of magnitude, anyway, as long as we&#39;re all friends? Right? Anybody?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-024-01715-0&quot;&gt;This paper&lt;/a&gt; is a direct warning about this sort of thing. There have been others, but it&#39;s nice to have the story all in one place. Some of the common clogP tools overestimate lipophilicity by huge, ruinous amounts just like with cyclosporine. Peptidic macrocycles like that, in fact, seem to be one of the best ways to make them break down and start returning nonsense. The authors show that other clogP calculators (ChemAxon, RDKit, StarDrop, and DW) do a far more accurate job, but the literature is still full of Daylight-derived estimates (not least because the popular ChemDraw program uses it). The paper demonstrates this with an assortment of molecules that have experimentally determined logP values and show that Daylight is vulnerable to going wildly off into the greasy beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So please bear this in mind! If you&#39;re ruling out interesting compounds just because of their calculated properties, you need to stop doing that in general. Run the experiment! But you definitely need to stop using these unrealistic clogP values.&lt;/p&gt;

That is, the environment of the upper mantle of the Earth, with pressures over 10 gigaPascals and temperatures up to 1400K. That pressure is about 1.5 million pounds per square inch, in case you&#39;re wondering, but this is one of those times that switching to &quot;kitchen units&quot; does not make things more relatable for an American reader, because yikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is readily appreciated that very little synthetic chemistry has been investigated under such conditions, but one&#39;s natural assumptions would be that (as stated above) everything will go to hell, even when you&#39;re starting (as the authors do here) with merely ammonia, water, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide. My own mental picture is of some intractable solid polymer along with some gaseous by-products and not much in between. But the authors have applied a lot of computational power to modeling chemical behavior in this range, and they have surprising results.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s important to note that they&#39;re not considering what minerals, etc. might be present at all, but they still find &quot;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span role=&quot;presentation&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;potential&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span role=&quot;presentation&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span role=&quot;presentation&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;formation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span role=&quot;presentation&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span role=&quot;presentation&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span role=&quot;presentation&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot; aria-owns=&quot;pdfjs_internal_id_422R&quot;&gt;substantial &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span role=&quot;presentation&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;quantities of organic matter without any catalyst&lt;/em&gt;&quot; with the compositions of that organic matter being very dependent on conditions. These include things like urea, pyrimidines, glycine, furanose rings like ribose, and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span role=&quot;presentation&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The C-N bond seems to hold up particularly well under these conditions (thus some of those compounds above), and reversing the situation at room temperature and pressure, the five-carbon furanose carbohydrates are preferred over the six-carbon pyranose ones, and the five-membered cyclic forms are likewise preferred over the six-membered ones. The authors note (naturally) that their results dovetail well with the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world&quot;&gt;RNA world&lt;/a&gt;&quot; hypothesis and the presence of the furanose rings in the sugars of both RNA and DNA. (Remember, that one is far from being proven, but it has a lot of fans for a lot of reasons). They also highlight that these conditions are likely to be found in a number of environments around a growing planetary system, both in the mantles of the smaller rocky planets and in the atmospheres of the gas giants, and that these could prove to be applicable to conditions in the interiors of the outer planet moons as well (with particular attention to the ones we know of with liquid water oceans like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon)&quot;&gt;Europa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus&quot;&gt;Enceladus&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span role=&quot;presentation&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This adds to the ever-growing body of literature, both theoretical and practical (i.e., spectra from interstellar clouds, comets, and the like along with samples from meteorites) that the molecules of Life As We Know It are. . .nothing special. In fact, they&#39;re the opposite: they&#39;re extremely common, to the point that the universe in some ways appears to be coated with them. So from that perspective, they are actually very special indeed, because they&#39;re what gets made naturally under abiotic conditions starting from the most common gaseous small molecules that we see everywhere. Carbohydrates, amino acids, nitrogen bases are everywhere, and the big question is still how easy (or difficult) is it to generate organized self-replicating forms if you warm them up together for extended periods. That&#39;s a Big Question, one of the biggest, and I hope to live long enough to see real progress made on answering it!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/down-mantle</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/down-mantle</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 11:35:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Anti-Bredt Olefins: Never Say Never!</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Here at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, there&#39;s a new paper that will surprise many a former student of second-year organic chemistry. One of the things you learn about is the concept of ring strain, which makes a lot of intuitive sense: carbon compounds form various types of rings, but some of them are easier to form than others, and some of them are more stable when they&#39;re made. That&#39;s because the various bonding arrangements of carbon atoms (known to chemists as sp3, sp2, and sp) have very defined geometries: sp3 carbons are tetrahedral, with the four bonds coming out at angles of exactly 109.5 degrees to each other. sp2 carbons (involved in a double-bond) have planar bonds at 120 degrees to each other, and sp carbons (triple-bonded) are linear, with the prototype (acetylene) having the two bonds on the ends at 180 degrees to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.zfve8qn/rss/bredt-1730470495397.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;Those are the ideal angles, but this is not an ideal world. There&#39;s some room to bend things a bit, but those are going to be higher-energy compounds that will probably be harder to make and that may well be more reactive once they&#39;re made (so they can turn into something else and relieve those strained bonds). A classic example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bredt%27s_rule&quot;&gt;Bredt&#39;s Rule&lt;/a&gt;, which says that molecules with a &quot;bridgehead&quot; double bond are either difficult to make or just don&#39;t seem to exist. At right you&#39;ll see a simple example: the left-hand molecule is norbornene, a perfectly reasonable little bicyclic. But the norbornene isomer at its right is &quot;anti-Bredt&quot;, in that you&#39;ve put the double bond on the red bridgehead carbon, and the geometry just does not work out well for that. The double bond is very strained indeed being dragged out of planarity like that. If you have much larger rings, you can get away with it (like 9, 10, 11-membered at least), but not on something as compact as norbornene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.zfve8qn/rss/bredtsynth-1730470495397.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;Now to the new paper. The authors looked over the existing literature on preparing &quot;ABOs&quot; and note a few successes and partial successes, along with several failures due to other rearrangements interfering. They chose a system where the bridgehead carbon has a triflate or nonaflate leaving group on it, and the carbon next to it has a triethylsilyl group. Silyl groups absolutely love to partner up with fluoride; the Si-F bond has driven many a reaction scheme (just as has the P-O double bond for the same sorts of thermodynamic reasons). If you run that reaction (peeling off the silyl group with a leaving group on the adjacent bridgehead carbon) and do it in the presence of a molecule that can trap the possible anti-Bredt product, by gosh that&#39;s exactly what you get: compound 31 in that scheme is the Diels-Alder product of the reaction between 30 and the famously &quot;impossible&quot; olefin 12. By varying the reaction conditions, they can get up to 90% yield for the reaction (!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it does exist, although it is certainly ready not to, and will react with the first thing it can in order to get out of the twisted geometry it was born into. The paper demonstrates that by trapping 12 with a whole range of partners (other Diels-Alder partners like furans and pyrroles, dipolar cycloaddition partners like nitrones, even 2+2 partners to make cyclobutanes). That last one shows you just how reactive these things are, because those are typically not easy to form under non-photochemical conditions. The reaction works with other highly strained rings, and in the presence of a variety of functional groups. The stereochemistry of the products tends to be highly defined, and the paper goes into some interesting discussions of what the molecular orbitals of the ABOs must be like in order to rationalize these. I won&#39;t go into the details, but as you&#39;d imagine, giving what should be a planar distribution of electron density a pretzel twist does change things substantially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s worth noting that earlier attempts at stability computations often said that compound 12 wasn&#39;t even possible, but more modern treatments showed that it was within the range of possibility. It appears likely that this sort of experiment could have been done years ago if someone else had managed to persuade themselves that it could possibly work! As the study&#39;s lead author, Neil Garg of UCLA &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/chemists-broke-100-year-old-rule-time-to-rewrite-textbooks&quot;&gt;put it:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&quot;We shouldn’t have rules like this — or if we have them, they should only exist with the constant reminder that they’re guidelines, not rules. It destroys creativity when we have rules that supposedly can’t be overcome&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to the Garg group at UCLA and co-workers for having enough nerve to give it a try, and for opening up a new suite of what used to be &quot;impossible&quot; reactions and products. Here&#39;s hoping someone is inspired to go break some more rules. . .&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/anti-bredt-olefins-never-say-never</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/anti-bredt-olefins-never-say-never</guid><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2024 09:05:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Eli Lilly&#39;s Earnings</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Since it&#39;s that season, let&#39;s dive into the wonderful world of corporate earnings, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/30/eli-lilly-lly-earnings-q3-2024.html&quot;&gt;using Eli Lilly as an example&lt;/a&gt;. Many readers here navigate this stuff all the time, but if you&#39;re not used to it, parsing earnings statements can be like working your way through a mirror maze. Lilly&#39;s Q3 statement is a fine example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, the company made money. &lt;em&gt;Of course&lt;/em&gt; they made money; they&#39;ve got (along with Novo Nordisk) some of the hottest prescription drugs in the world right now in their GLP-1 portfolio. The company had $11.4 billion dollars in revenue for the quarter (up 20% versus the third quarter figures from last year), with a net income of $970 million after expenses. Sounds pretty good, right? But now we start appending asterisks to those numbers. Right off the top, the company noted that there was a $2.8 billion charge against revenues due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-acquire-morphic-improve-outcomes-patients-inflammatory&quot;&gt;their acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of Morphic during this quarter (a company that&#39;s developing orally-dosed integrin ligands for inflammatory bowel disease and related conditions). Analysts following Lilly were surely expected some sort of charge from that acquisition, though, but the company is mentioning it specifically because that $11.4 billion figure was, in fact, a disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These analysts (at the various Wall Street firms) expected Lilly to have brought in about $12.2 billion instead. And if you look at the sales figures for those GLP-1 drugs, you see a shortfall there: the two forms of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirzepatide&quot;&gt;tirzepatide&lt;/a&gt; they sell are Mounjaro (for diabetes) which brought in $3.1 billion when the expected number was $3.6, and Zepbound (for obesity), which brought in $1.3 billion rather than the $1.7 billion expected. That&#39;s a particular concern for those following the stock, because as you&#39;d imagine sales of those two are currently the big driver for earnings expectations. And as for those expectations for the whole year, Lilly had previously estimated their earnings-per-share for the year to be $16.10 to $16.60, but have now revised that down to between $13 and $13.50. That sort of revision is going to make your stock go down, and indeed, Lilly&#39;s stock took quit a notable hit after these results were released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s easy to see why: the Street loves increasing earnings and hates downside misses and uncertainty, and Lilly offered up both of those. The feeling is that a company this size with drugs that are this important to its business should have had a better handle on how much of them they would be able to produce and sell. But apparently they don&#39;t (as witness this earnings surprise). Of course, all of the GLP-1 drugs have famously been in short supply as the companies involved have frantically been adding more manufacturing capacity - being caught short by the demand to that degree already shows that their forecasts were not the most reliable to start with. (And that shouldn&#39;t be too much of a surprise, either, although it always seems to be: forecasts for the sales of new drugs can be significantly off in either direction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly&#39;s CEO said, though, that the revenue miss for the GLP-1 drugs was &quot;not a function of supply&quot;, but was rather due to wholesalers cutting down on their inventories. I am not equipped to say how plausible that is, but it&#39;s certainly true that the supply chain for these drugs has been disrupted all to hell. And that&#39;s well illustrated by the huge amount of grey-market supply movement and the number of compounding pharmacies offering both the Lilly and Novo Nordisk drugs. The law says that they can do that when the regular drugs are officially in short supply (as they have been), but you may have seen the headlines &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-clarifies-policies-compounders-national-glp-1-supply-begins-stabilize&quot;&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; that the FDA decided to take tirzepatide off that list. That brought in huge protests from the compounding pharmacies, including a lawsuit and a subsequent court order, and the agency &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/media/182948/download?attachment&quot;&gt;last week announced&lt;/a&gt; that they would not take action against the compounding pharmacies for violating the shortage rule. But they naturally reserved the right to take regulatory action in the case of substandard or mislabeled products made in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s not making either Lilly or Novo Nordisk very happy, and Novo &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/novo-nordisk-asks-us-stop-compounding-pharmacies-making-weight-loss-drug-copies-2024-10-23/&quot;&gt;has petitioned the FDA&lt;/a&gt; to put its drug (semaglutide) on a list of compounds that are banned from being compounded due to their manufacturing complexity. This is one of those times that I am glad that I don&#39;t work for the FDA, because they are getting it from all sides here: manufacturers, patients, insurance companies, physicians, investors, and the compounding pharmacies. There is no way to make all of these people pleased with you at the same time. The agency is going for increasing the supplies to patients as the first priority, it seems, which is certainly a reasonable route (unless you&#39;re at Eli Lilly or Novo Nordisk) but they can&#39;t go on like this forever, either. This month&#39;s decision was a trial run for getting back to the usual framework, and it didn&#39;t go well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Lilly did not explictly blame the compounding pharmacy situation for their earnings miss, although their CEO did say that they agreed with the FDA&#39;s original decision that tirzepatide was no longer in shortage. But at the same time, the company talked about all the measures that they&#39;re taking to improve manufacturing capacity through next year, so if it&#39;s not in shortage it sure ain&#39;t in surplus, either. You can expect the wild earnings calls to continue, in other words. . .&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/eli-lilly-s-earnings</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/eli-lilly-s-earnings</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2024 10:46:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Choice</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Once again, some politics. And once again I will probably regret bringing it up. But it is one week until the US presidential election, and unfortunately we are back to a horrible high-stakes contest between two wildly different ideas about what this country is and what it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will come as no surprise that I am strongly urging, beseeching people to vote against Donald Trump, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/politics-unfortunately&quot;&gt;as I have&lt;/a&gt; for years. There is no need to go into why I hold this opinion: at this point, no one can claim ignorance of what the man is and what he aspires to. He is exactly the sort of person who should never, ever attain the sort of power he is seeking, and his election would be the greatest disaster in American politics since &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; the Civil War. Again, I do not intend to argue these points. You either agree with them or you don&#39;t, and if we disagree strongly about Donald Trump at this point, our chances of ever reaching agreement on him are very small indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this doesn&#39;t just have to be about him. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/note-robert-f-kennedy-jr&quot;&gt;recently wrote&lt;/a&gt; about my loathing for the views of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (to pick one example from many), and this is the man that Trump said just this week that he would let &quot;go wild&quot; on heath and food policy in a potential second administration. That is a catastrophically bad idea, but it is one of many. And RFK Jr. is just one of many catastrophically bad appointments that are waiting for us. A second Trump term would feature no one who would be willing to say no to whatever ideas might flit though his head - one thing that he seems to have learned from his first stint in the White House is that there were too many people who were appalled by his behavior and his ideas once they saw him in action. We won&#39;t have any of those around; the brakes will be off and the accelerator will be floored. Trump and his surrogates have made this extremely clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equally clear has been his repeated talk about an &quot;enemy within&quot;, and how the country needs to be purified of such people through mass deportations, interments, arrests, and more. That &quot;enemy within&quot; surely includes people like my own wife and her family - naturalized American citizens born in Iran. It includes many friends and coworkers who will not measure up to a Trump administration&#39;s idea of so-called &quot;real Americans&quot;. Hell, it includes me and anyone else who is loudly, visibly, publicly opposed to Trump and his policies. As far as he&#39;s concerned, we&#39;re all &quot;enemies of the People&quot; and we&#39;ll deserve whatever we get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defeating him and his syncophants at the polls will not be enough by itself. I continue to be sickened by the idea that nearly half the country still seems willing to support this man - finds him appealing, exciting, amusing. As has been painfully obvious for years now, some of my ideas about my fellow Americans were clearly based on wishful thinking. But defeating him is absolutely necessary. Please vote, and please vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. This one&#39;s bad. This one is the worst yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/choice</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/choice</guid><pubDate>Tue, 29 Oct 2024 12:58:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>GLP-1 For Everything</title><description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s getting to the point of wondering what GLP-1 agonists &lt;em&gt;aren&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; good for. There have been reports of the benefits of these drugs not only for obesity, but for &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.vumc.org/2024/10/25/blockbuster-obesity-drugs-also-may-slow-kidney-disease-study/&quot;&gt;kidney disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medpagetoday.com/meetingcoverage/asrm/112572&quot;&gt;uterine fibroids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/glp-1s-may-protect-against-progression-cirrhosis-masld-2024a1000jko?form=fpf&quot;&gt;cirrhosis&lt;/a&gt; in steatotic liver disease, for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/glp-1-drugs-like-ozempic-may-protect-brain-health#How-GLP-1-drugs-may-protect-the-brain&quot;&gt;cerebrovascular health&lt;/a&gt; in general, and many more conditions. The expectations have also been high for them to show effects in addiction, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.16679&quot;&gt;recent analyses&lt;/a&gt; of data from patients with substance use disorders suggests that may well be the case (fewer examples of overdoses, etc). And now another look at patient records shows a &lt;a href=&quot;https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.14313&quot;&gt;markedly reduced risk&lt;/a&gt; of Alzheimer&#39;s disease as measured by intitial diagnoses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those sorts of patient-record patient reviews are not as strong as an intentional clinical trial, but they ain&#39;t hay, either, especially on the scale that we&#39;re seeing (that Alzheimer&#39;s one was backed up by the data on over one million patients). I&#39;m quite surprised by the number of benefits we&#39;re seeing, and it makes you wonder if (evolutionarily) our settings for eating and weight gain have really been doing us even more of a disservice than we realized in a modern world of plenty. As always, evolution doesn&#39;t really notice us once very much we&#39;re past the childbearing/raising years, so one hand-waving hypothesis could be that the eating behaviors that led to greater success at reproduction in earlier years are not very good for the long haul of extended age. We already had the concept of &quot;metabolic syndrome&quot; (a complex of Type II diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular problems), but it looks like some of the pathways that keep us from starving to death so easily move beyond even that. The weight loss involved with GLP-1 agonist treatment is surely a big player in many of these beneficial effects, but there seem to be some pleiotropic ones beyond what one could explain by weight loss alone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#39;re not only going to be treating (or outright preventing) a number of diseases, we&#39;re going to be learning more about the cause of these diseases than we ever did before. Has everyone&#39;s GLP-1 axis been turned down a bit low compared to the &quot;real&quot; optimum (however you define that)? If so, we&#39;re going to kick off some more tough arguments about what it means to be &quot;normal&quot; as opposed to better than normal, aka &quot;what normal could have (should have?) been&quot;. But we get to decide what&#39;s optimal by our own standards,&amp;nbsp; and it&#39;s possible that extra GLP-1 activity is going to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/10/24/its-not-just-obesity-drugs-like-ozempic-will-change-the-world&quot;&gt;the new standard&lt;/a&gt;. More data on the benefits (and/or risks) will be pouring in every year, and the story will develop slowly. But it could be a very big one for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/glp-1-everything</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/glp-1-everything</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A Pfight at Pfizer</title><description>&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s some rumbling going on within Pfizer&#39;s investment community, as an activist hedge fund &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/starboard-value-ceo-says-pfizers-board-should-hold-management-accountable-2024-10-22/&quot;&gt;says that&lt;/a&gt; the company&#39;s performance has not been good enough. The CEO of Starboard Investors made some headlines this week when he told a conference that &quot;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;We measure success in producing blockbuster drugs and we all get measured by our track records. The track record here is not great&lt;/em&gt;&quot; Starboard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/activist-investor-starboard-value-takes-1-billion-stake-pfizer-wsj-reports-2024-10-07/&quot;&gt;holds roughly $1 billion&lt;/a&gt; in Pfizer stock, so they are not exactly a voice crying in the wilderness here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That second link quotes unnamed sources as saying the the company&#39;s former CEO Ian Read and former CFO Frank D&#39;Amelio &quot;have expressed interest&quot; in helping Starboard make these waves, which is interesting. Pfizer has been in an anomalous situation the last few years, to be sure, thanks to the pandemic. The vaccine developed with BioNTech and the viral&amp;nbsp; protease inhibitor Paxlovid gave a huge boost to the company&#39;s earnings, but that period seems to be over. Both these products still sell, of course, but the sudden flood of revenue is not going to come back. Well, at least I hope it&#39;s not, if you know what I mean.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So Starboard is in a &quot;What have you done for us lately&quot; mood, and that&#39;s one that biopharma companies are always vulnerable to. It&#39;s a choppy business, despite management forever talking about smooth ramps to steady growth as the pipelines keep rolling along and delivering the big wins. The truth is that the big wins are not so predictable (and nor are the big losses, naturally). And every new drug has a clock ticking over its head until patents start expiring and generic competition shows up. Like many others, I have worked at a company during the flush years when the company&#39;s big seller has just been approved, and I have also watched as the years go on afterwards as you wonder what&#39;s going to replace it. Sometimes the next big project comes through, and sometimes it doesn&#39;t, and that means that sometimes the company and the investors get to watch in slow-motion horror as the big flagship drug heads for the patent cliff as it becomes increasingly clear that there&#39;s nothing to replace it with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then there&#39;s always the question of productivity in general. If you look at R&amp;amp;D spending versus results, you can see a pretty big spread across companies. It&#39;s tempting to assume that something is going right for the ones at the top and going wrong for the ones at the bottom - why are they spending so much more money with nothing to show for it, anyway? That explanation doesn&#39;t have to be wrong, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be completely right, either, because &quot;time and chance happeneth to them all&quot;, as it says in Ecclesiastes. The picture you see is a mixture of different levels of competence and different levels of luck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the performance of the stock is an issue on top of that! Stocks and their underlying companies are not always in sync. Pfizer&#39;s trading for about half of its value during the pandemic high and you can look at that the way that Starboard does and say that that performance is just unacceptable, but one could also ask if the company&#39;s valuation didn&#39;t also get ahead of reality for a while. After all, the whole idea of rolling out vaccines and antiviral therapies for a new pathogen is to lower the need for their use, right? Whether you like Pfizer or not (my opinions vary with time) and whether you like their CEO Albert Bourla or not, the company did a great deal to combat the coronavirus. And they were richly rewarded for it, but those rewards didn&#39;t (and couldn&#39;t) go on forever. If Starboard is wondering why Pfizer&#39;s stock isn&#39;t back at its peak, that&#39;s a reason for you right there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next question is just what, exactly, Starboard plans do to about it. They talk about poor capital allocation and various R&amp;amp;D failures, but I can&#39;t imagine that anyone at the hedge fund knows diddly-squat about actual pharma R&amp;amp;D decisions (to be fair, most people don&#39;t). Asking them which projects they&#39;d allocate more or less funding to, what disease areas they&#39;d prioritize and why - these would be wastes of time. And even if they had great answers, even if those answers were &lt;em&gt;completely right and just what Pfizer should do&lt;/em&gt;, how long would it be before you saw the real effects? You&#39;re looking (as always) at multiyear timelines, and as I&#39;ve said before, one of the problems with making big sweeping management changes in this business is that by the time those changes do anything the team that made them is probably gone. Perhaps the answer is that bit about Ian Read and &lt;span&gt;Frank D&#39;Amelio? It might be that Starboard&#39;s plan is &quot;Give it back to those guys and bring the good times back&quot;. Which brings up the question of just how good those times were, and whether those conditions can be replicated now even if you like them in restrospect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But who am I kidding? Starboard, like any hedge fund, is not looking out for Pfizer as much as they&#39;re looking out for Starboard. They see an opportunity to make a lot of money by taking a large position in a stock that&#39;s not doing so great and goosing its value by coming in with Big Plans to Fix Things. That has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starboard_Value&quot;&gt;worked very well&lt;/a&gt; for them over the years, most notably with Darden Restaurants, and the same techniques that worked on Olive Garden will probably be applied here. Whether things actually get fixed or not, even whether they were broken or not in the first place, are secondary to making other investors believe in both of those propositions. So the stock goes up. Drugs, research, medical science, all that stuff? Levers, tools, buttons to push and signs to wave to make the stock go up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/pfight-pfizer</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/pfight-pfizer</guid><pubDate>Thu, 24 Oct 2024 07:20:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Clinical Trial Volunteers, And Others</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to call attention to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-024-00107-2&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; from earlier this year that&#39;s addressing some issues that most people don&#39;t (or maybe would rather not) think about: why is it that we expect people to volunteer for clinical trials? What would fair compensation look like? And are we providing it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional worry is that providing lots of meaningful compensation/payment runs the risk of messing with &quot;informed consent&quot;, which is supposed to be the backbone of clinical trial research in general. If the package is too generous, the thinking goes, then participants can find ways to rationalize their participation and not pay so much attention to the risks involved. But at the same time, it doesn&#39;t seem fair to place an outright burden on participants just so that they have a chance to advance medical science and the common good. Remember, when you sign up for a well-run full-scale trial you can be assigned to the placebo group without your knowledge, so the idea of joining a trial to get otherwise-unavailable possible treatments doesn&#39;t always work out. And trials can have significant externalities and lost opportunity costs for participants (time and money, travel, disruption of other activities, and so on). If you don&#39;t compensate people for those, are you actually exploiting them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the article notes, one of the key things that a clinical trial is going to take from you is time - sometimes lots of it. And we generally expect (should expect!) that people should be paid for their time. Just from that standpoint, it would seem that clinical trial compensation is due for a rethink, and that&#39;s what the article is calling for. One thing that many of has have probably not appreciated is that changes in this area are (to a great extent) a &lt;em&gt;tax problem&lt;/em&gt;, of all things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . .there are three other, tangible barriers blocking reform efforts. First, tax law is one of the greatest impediments to increasing clinical trial compensation. In many parts of the world, compensation received beyond reasonable reimbursement for expenses, including for research, is typically taxed. For example, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/attachments/publications/Payment-of-participants-in-research.pdf&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/attachments/publications/Payment-of-participants-in-research.pdf&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;Australian National Health and Medical Research Council&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;notes that participants should be notified of the potential for tax implications from research compensation. In the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.staff.universiteitleiden.nl/finance-and-procurement/financial-services/payments-to-research-participants&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.staff.universiteitleiden.nl/finance-and-procurement/financial-services/payments-to-research-participants&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, one research institution notes a monthly compensation limit before needing to notify tax authorities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the USA in particular, compensation for participant time and burdens is taxable income and institutions are obligated to report payments exceeding US$600 per calendar year to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This discourages participation, especially among people with modest incomes, whose eligibility for assistance programmes and health insurance may be jeopardized by additional taxable income. Moreover, in the USA, taxes are not withheld from clinical trial income and may need to be paid to the IRS later, which can also induce strain on participants who may not be used to budgeting tax expenses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors are calling for this situation to be simplified and also (as much as possible) to be standardized between different countries, which will not be easy. But as things are now, the various groups involved (clinicians, hospital administrators, drug companies, and more) can all blame each other for the situation, so things are set up for nothing to get done. Any reform effort is going to have to bring these groups together for some of that common good that we were talking about above. I hope that it can happen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US already changed a law in 2015 to raise the amount of tax-free compensation for rare-disease-trial participants. A start might be to do that across the board or (better yet, but harder to realize) to remove such caps entirely. I like that latter idea in principle, but I can imagine that people more avaricious than I am would find ways to game that sort of system, so we&#39;d still have to have some watchdogging. But it could beat what we have now, where trial recruitment can turn into a much longer affair than the actual patient dosing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/clinical-trial-volunteers-and-others</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/clinical-trial-volunteers-and-others</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 11:06:29 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>HCN in Acetonitrile, You Say?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I was quite surprised by &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.oprd.4c00336&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Organic Process Research and Development&lt;/em&gt;. But as someone who doesn&#39;t have to do too much rigorous QC work, it&#39;s quite possible that I&#39;ve just lead a sheltered life. The authors report an odd behavior on analysis of some aldehyde-containing compounds, and that at least I can relate to. Aldehydes are valuable synthetic intermediates, but that&#39;s because they&#39;re so darn reactive in so many directions. They can oligimerize, air-oxidize, do a Cannizzaro reaction and simultaneously oxidize and reduce, form enols or enol ethers, gem-diol hydrates, hemiacetals and acetals if there&#39;s any alcohol present, and of course react with amine, thiols, and other functional groups. In many cases all you need is a trace of acid or base to get one of these parties started, and if you have anything stronger in there you are almost guaranteed to set things off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, though, the authors were analyzing what was supposed to be a pure compound that showed a mismatch between the NMR purity and the LC purity. There was a small extra peak in the chromatography, implying that this formed only under the chromatographic conditions. The paper lists a number of examples where such things are known to happen, ranging from the &quot;Oh sure seen that one myself&quot; category (deprotection of acid-labile groups under acidic column conditions) to the exotic (reaction with tiny bits of nitrite impurites leaching from the sample vials). In this case, the impurity peak (which could go up to a bit over 1% of the total in some cases) was always +27 in mass, and it did not appear to have an aldehyde in it any more (no sign of the bits of hydrate adduct that they could often see at much lower levels, for example).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That weight difference immediately suggests a possible structure, and that was confirmed by close analysis of the fragmentation pattern along with deuterium-exchange reactions and outright synthesis. It was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanohydrin_reaction&quot;&gt;cyanohydrin&lt;/a&gt;! Those are formed by the formal reaction of an aldehyde with HCN, where the cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon. Formation of such a compound was an old-fashioned diagnostic test for the presence of an aldehyde. To be sure there are a lot of those, considering their above-mentioned multivariate reactivity, and many of them were better- formation of a colorful &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine&quot;&gt;dinitrophenylhydrazone&lt;/a&gt; is another classic, as is the production of a silver mirror in the reaction vessel with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tollens%27_reagent&quot;&gt;Tollen&#39;s test&lt;/a&gt; or the formation of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisulfite&quot;&gt;bisulfite adduct&lt;/a&gt;. But all of those have been out of date for many decades; NMR and LC/MS are (as usual) where it&#39;s at. You&#39;ll see people using cyanohydrins as synthetic intermediates sometimes, but no one forms them as a test for aldehydes any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no one is supposed to be forming them inadvertantly, either! The HCN, it turned out, was coming from their acetonitrile as used in the liquid chromatography, and it disappeared when they switched brands/suppliers. The authors don&#39;t say, but I feel about 99% certain that it was the cheaper stuff that they were using at first that had the trace HCN. That actually is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0731708518326967?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;a known problem&lt;/a&gt; with lesser grades of acetonitrile, but I have to say that I had never encountered it. Perhaps I have been living an even more luxurious life than I realized. But it&#39;s something to keep in mind if you come across an odd little impurity that only shows up in the LC runs!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/hcn-acetonitrile-you-say</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/hcn-acetonitrile-you-say</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 11:48:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>AI Does Not Make It Easy</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s check in with some of the early movers in the field of AI drug discovery and see how things are going. I first wrote about Atomwise &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/pipeline-4435&quot;&gt;back in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, when I found the hype around the company a bit hard to take (and an interview with one of its founders likewise, as that post will illustrate). One of its founders (Alex Levy) is quoted therein, but he left the company in 2018. Their founding CEO, Abe Heifets, has left the company in recent months &lt;a href=&quot;https://endpts.com/ai-company-atomwises-founding-ceo-exits-casting-doubt-over-startup/&quot;&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Endpoints&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, although Atomwise themselves have not (to my knowledge) made any specific announcement about that. As that article notes, the company has yet to send any molecules into the clinic, although they have said that they were going to nominate a TYK2 inhibitor by the end of this year. I&#39;m not sure how that&#39;s going to work out, though, because it&#39;s been several years since they raised significant funding, unless I&#39;ve missed something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/ambition-recursion&quot;&gt;here in 2014&lt;/a&gt; about another company from that era, Recursion Pharma, who memorably stated back then that they were going to develop 100 drugs in ten years. And that mostly through repurposing, yet. Now, in 2020 I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/eqrx-s-challenge-and-my-challenge-them&quot;&gt;had a fit&lt;/a&gt; about another company, EQRx (not an AI outfit) saying that they would develop a mere ten drugs in ten years, so you can imagine what I thought about Recursion&#39;s plans. (Things &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/world-has-its-way-eqrx&quot;&gt;didn&#39;t work out&lt;/a&gt; for EQRx in the way that they&#39;d planned, either, as some will recall). Recursion is still with us, I will say, although the ride has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2024/08/19/recursion-pharmaceuticals-front-runner-ai-in-medicine-new-drug-development/&quot;&gt;not been a smooth one&lt;/a&gt;, and I will give their CEO some begrudging credit: he has realized that the 100-drug target will not be met within that ten-year time frame (it being 2024 and all), and says now that it may take more like twelve to fourteen. You&#39;d think that they would have their hands pretty full already, having recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/after-tough-year-exscientia-folds-recursion-create-ai-super-power&quot;&gt;completed a merger&lt;/a&gt; with fast-fading Exscientia. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/another-ai-generated-drug&quot;&gt;wrote about &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but in recent years Exscientia had two clinical candidates wipe out and had to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/exscientia-fires-ceo-andrew-hopkins-over-inappropriate-relationships-2-employees#:~:text=AI%20drug%20hunter%20Exscientia%20has,and%20inconsistent%E2%80%9D%20with%20company%20values.&quot;&gt;fire their CEO&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year over inappropriate relationships with two employees. So Recursion did at least provide a spot for them to land, and they certainly needed one by that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, even back in 2014 I mentioned that Recursion were working on a drug for cerebral cavernous malformation (which is quite an ambitious target), and they have continued on that path. It is indeed a repurposed molecule, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Hydroxy-TEMPO&quot;&gt;4-hydroxy TEMPO&lt;/a&gt;. Last month &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2024/09/03/recursion-pharmaceuticals-ai-derived-drug-candidate-for-ccm-mixed-data/&quot;&gt;they announced&lt;/a&gt; Phase II results, which were surely not as impressive as they had hoped. While the drug was well tolerated, it missed all possible efficacy endpoints, with the company saying that it &quot;showed a trend&quot; towards reducing the size of lesions in the disease. Whether that is enough to go on into Phase III is an open question, from what I can see. Recursion says that they have several other data readouts coming on other programs over the coming months, and those will be of great interest to their shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there&#39;s BenevolentAI. I first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/benevolentai-worth-two-billion&quot;&gt;wrote about them in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, as the company stated that it had &quot;&lt;em&gt;created a bioscience machine brain, purpose-built to discover new medicines and cures for disease.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; How&#39;s the machine brain doing these days? Well, the company&#39;s lead program &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/ai-and-hard-stuff&quot;&gt;failed in the clinic&lt;/a&gt; last year, and in April announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/benevolentai-lays-30-staff-exits-us-site-funding-gap-looms&quot;&gt;major layoffs&lt;/a&gt;. But just this week they abruptly announced that the company&#39;s CEO, Jörg Möller (ex-Bayer) was stepping down effective immediately, no reason given. He had only been on the job &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.benevolent.com/news-and-media/press-releases-and-in-media/benevolentai-appoints-dr-joerg-moeller-chief-executive-officer/&quot;&gt;since January&lt;/a&gt;, so this does not look good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll finish up with InSilico, and I&#39;ve written about them several times over the years &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/has-ai-discovered-drug-now-guess&quot;&gt;starting in 2019&lt;/a&gt; (follow-up to that post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/arguing-ai-drug-discovery&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/another-ai-drug-announcement&quot;&gt;wrote in 2021&lt;/a&gt; about the company&#39;s announcement of trials starting in an antifibrosis drug program, and I see that I did indeed guess their target protein correctly. Last month &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/insilico-medicine-reports-positive-phase-iia-results-for-ism001-055-a-novel-first-in-class-drug-treatment-for-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-ipf-designed-using-generative-ai&quot;&gt;they reported&lt;/a&gt; Phase IIa results for that very compound. Like Recursion&#39;s trial mentioned above, this one had its primary endpoint as safety (not an approach used very often), but it appeared to meet its secondary endpoint for lung function as well. But the study was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biospace.com/drug-development/boehringer-insilico-appear-to-break-through-against-ipf&quot;&gt;not really powered enough&lt;/a&gt; (nor run for long enough, according to an observer in that article) to draw the sort of firm conclusions that the company would &lt;a href=&quot;https://endpts.com/with-few-efficacy-details-insilico-claims-a-phase-2a-win-in-latest-ai-readout/&quot;&gt;like to be able to&lt;/a&gt;, and people are waiting for the results of a separate Phase II. As is InSilico - they say they plan to meet with regulators to discuss plans for a Phase IIb trial. When a Phase III might happen, I&#39;m not sure. I note that the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://endpts.com/insilico-medicine-an-early-force-in-ai-driven-drug-rd-lets-ipo-plans-peter-out-for-second-year-in-a-row/&quot;&gt;seems to have ditched&lt;/a&gt; earlier plans to raise money in Hong Kong. This is a work in progress, and who knows, it might still work out. But as you can see, not everything has in this area. . .&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/ai-does-not-make-it-easy</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/ai-does-not-make-it-easy</guid><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 09:09:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Accelerated Approval: What Is It Accomplishing?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/abstract/S1535-6108(24)00353-2&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; is a valuable up-to-date look at the landscape around the FDA&#39;s accelerated approval system. I last wrote about this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/getting-accelerated-approval-wrong&quot;&gt;about a year ago&lt;/a&gt;, quoting a well-researched article that suggested that the process has been going off the rails - i.e., the agency is handing out too many of these designations. This new look at the situation does not alleviate those concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start off with, let&#39;s make clear what the ideas are behind accelerated approval in the first place. The usual non-accelerated process is of course a Phase I trial in normal volunteers to confirm blood levels and pharmacokinetics, followed by one or more Phase II trials (generally the first time a new drug actually is given to patients with the targeted disease), which establish that there is indeed meaningful efficacy without signs of disqualifying toxicities. Than one or more larger Phase III trials are run in such patients, and the idea here is that these trials are both larger (and thus statistically better powered) and done in a more representative real-world patient population, since Phase II trials are often a bit more of a sheltered greenhouse. After these, the whole data package is submitted to the FDA, which is supposed to evaluate things on the basis of efficacy balanced with safety, in the light of current unmet medical needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accelerated approval is supposed to be invoked for drugs that treat patients for whom there is really significant unmet need (up to those who have no approved treatments available at all). It allows for trials to be designed around surrogate endpoints that are expected to provide a more rapid readout of likely efficacy (as would be seen in a &quot;real&quot; Phase II), and for conditional approval if these surrogate endpoints are met without seeing significant safety concerns. Once an accelerated approval is granted, allowing the drug on the market, the requirement is that the drug has to go through a confirmatory trial (basically a Phase III design) to validate the efficacy under real-world conditions without relying on the surrogate endpoints. The agency is now requiring that enrollment in such a trial has to be underway before an accelerated approval is granted, because there was some apparent foot-dragging &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/oncology-follow-up-trials&quot;&gt;going on&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of it, a decision is made to convert the conditional approval to a full regulatory approval or (alternatively) to withdraw the drug from the market because it in fact does not work as hoped. Both of these situations &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/approval-withdrawn&quot;&gt;have occurred&lt;/a&gt;, of course. And as you might guess, the great majority of accelerated approvals have been in oncology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the new paper have looked over the data since 1992 (the first year that accelerated approval was offered) and find that between then and 2023 there have been 107 of those post-marketing confirmatory Phase III trials after accelerated approvals. And to back up that statement above, in the same period there were 8,077 &quot;standard&quot; pre-marketing Phase III trials. 25% of those were in oncology, whereas 81% of the confirmatory post-marketing trials were. But the trends in these oncology trials are worth noting: the failure rates of the traditional Phase III oncology trials have been gradually falling over this period (with an overall Phase III failure rate of about 41%, but currently at 34%), whereas the confirmatory post-marketing Phase III oncology trial failure rates have been &lt;em&gt;increasing &lt;/em&gt;in recent years, from around 14% during the 1992-2015 period to 33% in 2016-2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s concerning, because the whole idea behind accelerated approval was to pick out drugs that were likely to work and get to patients in need more quickly. The earlier failure rates in accelerated approval drugs were in line with this idea, but the last seven or eight years are certainly not. We seem to no longer be picking out drugs that look likely to work in the end and speeding up their approval. The authors note several problems that seem to be leading to this change, including too much reliance on objective response rates that don&#39;t necessarily translate to durable effects (and may be too optimistically assessed to start with), using surrogate endpoints that are not appropriate (and in some cases have well-founded reasons for doubt), and picking patient populations for the accelerate-approval trial that do not mimic the the sorts of patients that are going to be dosed once the drug hits the market. The FDA has been trying to address that last disconnect with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/tightening-accelerated-approval&quot;&gt;&quot;one-trial&quot; framework&lt;/a&gt;, to their credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can look at this from another direction, though, and say that since these are high-unmet-need patients that even if the eventual failure rate is the same as regular approvals, at least you&#39;re getting them moved along faster in the line. But that depends on whether you think that offering such patients the same-deal-but-faster is a good idea, or perhaps just needless (and expensive) cruelty. One could argue that desperate patients, if we&#39;re going to experiment on them with incompletely tested drugs, are owed ones that we think have a better chance of working. And maybe even more so if you think of it as those desperate patients paying the market prices for those incompletely tested drugs, which is what&#39;s happening during the post-marketing confirmatory trial phase. And remember, we already have things like Priority Review for things that aren&#39;t in the accelerated-approval category but still get moved along faster at the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whichever way you come at it, though, accelerated approvals have clearly been changing in the last few years. It would be good for everyone involved to realize that and decide if this is the way we want things to go, rather than just drifting along without comment. Cards on the table!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/accelerated-approval-what-it-accomplishing</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/accelerated-approval-what-it-accomplishing</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2024 10:51:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Cleaning up &quot;Scientific Reports&quot;: Can It Be Done?</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I have had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/crap-courtesy-major-scientific-publisher&quot;&gt;some problems&lt;/a&gt; with the journal &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; over the years, and I&#39;m &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/more-scientific-reports-and-faked-papers&quot;&gt;not alone&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, I&#39;ve read some interesting and useful papers published there as well. But worthless/faked manuscripts showing up in a journal tend to contaminate everything else that shows up there, which is a problem that you&#39;d hope that scientific publishers are concerned about. To put things in the style of my late father, his one of his analogies was that if he had a gallon of urine and put a shot glass of wine into it, he still had a gallon of urine. On the other hand, if he had a gallon of wine and put a shot glass of urine into that, he now had a &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; gallon of urine. That&#39;s the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://deevybee.blogspot.com/2024/10/an-open-letter-regarding-scientific.html&quot;&gt;This open letter&lt;/a&gt;, signed by many well-known literature fraud experts, is (to me) more than enough evidence that &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; has some serious problems with the papers it&#39;s letting through, and that the publishers (Springer Nature) are not doing enough to address them. It shows numerous examples of papers with odd and questionable references in them and with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/keeping-fakery&quot;&gt;phrases&lt;/a&gt; that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/too-much-delvin-goin&quot;&gt;redolent&lt;/a&gt; of (unstated) chatbot use, those apparently in attempts to bypass automated plagiarism-detection software. The authors of the letter note that even when the editors have taken action, that can be just to republish the same paper with slightly altered phrases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A striking example cropped up last week when a “corrected” version of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-41314-y&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;was published in Scientific Reports. This article had been flagged up by Guillaume Cabanac as containing numerous “tortured phrases” that are indicative of fraudulent authors attempting to bypass plagiarism checks; the authors were allowed to “correct” the article by merely removing some (not all) of the tortured phrases. This led some of us to look more closely at the article. As is evident from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/AB22CD1F2F709E28CA9A39D3FF31D1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;comments on PubPeer&lt;/a&gt;, it turned out to be a kind of case study of all the red flags for fraud that we look for. As well as (still uncorrected) tortured phrases, it contained irrelevant content, irrelevant citations, meaningless gibberish, a nonsensical figure, and material recycled from other publications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the letter goes on to note, deploying more AI and automated systems is not going to be enough to fix this problem. Actual humans are going to have to hit some buttons here, and some of those buttons need to be labeled &quot;delete&quot;. The journal needs to show what editors handle each paper (which is currently invisible), because it&#39;s likely that a small number of them are responsible for an outsize fraction of the problem. And Springer Nature needs to take more robust steps when junk papers, junk beyond the shadow of a doubt, are brought to their attention. There is just no way that some of these things could have passed any honest, competent human peer review without being flagged. The reviewers - if there are any - who have let these things be published need to be flagged themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let&#39;s see what sort of response this gets. And by reponse, I don&#39;t mean a statement of concern or a bunch of platitudes about the scientific literature. Actions, not words, are what is needed here. &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; already has a few too many words in it as it is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/cleaning-scientific-reports-can-it-be-done</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/cleaning-scientific-reports-can-it-be-done</guid><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2024 11:11:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Induced Proximity, in the Lab and in the Clinic</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve written a number of times here about bifunctional targeted protein degraders, the admittedly odd-looking molecules that are designed to bring two proteins together that otherwise would never see each other (in this case, a target protein and one that starts the cellular degradation machinery to work on it). As has become abundantly clear the last few years, there are a lot of variations that you can work on this idea. People have brought other protein-modifying enzymes over close to target proteins that would never otherwise be their clients (for phosphorylation, acetylation, and more), and there are plenty of other ideas where that came from. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01492-2&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s an overview&lt;/a&gt; from a meeting on this topic last fall, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S007964682400002X?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;here&#39;s a review&lt;/a&gt; from earlier this year and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.4c00191&quot;&gt;recent one&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;ACS Chemical Biology&lt;/em&gt;. The literature in this area is moving quickly, with new papers and new ideas appearing in a steady stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ideas are getting wilder as time goes on, and I mean that in a good way. &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.4c00286&quot;&gt;This new overview&lt;/a&gt; discusses methods that have appeared to recruit antibodies (either covalently or noncovalently) to cell surfaces that they might otherwise not recognize, and even further work on recruiting &lt;em&gt;entire cells&lt;/em&gt; to come into proximity with other cells on demand. That idea, as I&#39;ll bet some of you have guessed, is particularly interesting when you think about bringing in immune system components like macrophages, T cells, and NK (natural killer) cells, with the other end of the bifunctional molecule being something that, say, recognizes some specific surface protein common to tumor cells. As amazing as the immune response is, there are times when we would like to direct it somewhere else, and perhaps these approaches can cause that to happen. All of this is work in the very early stages; there&#39;s a lot more to come. We&#39;re going to learn a great deal from trying this (some of it the hard way, inevitably), but the possible rewards are tremendous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the original induced-proximity protein degrader molecules? Well, in the fullness of time several of them have made it to clinical trials with at least two of them in Phase III, as summarized &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41591-024-00072-8&quot;&gt;in this article&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-024-00170-9&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Nature Reviews Drug Discovery&lt;/em&gt;. That tells you that there&#39;s nothing show-stoppingly wrong with the idea as a whole, so now the success of these compounds is going to come down to having picked the right target, first and foremost, and getting enough efficacy (and selectivity) while going after it. Those are of course the same thing that non-degrader drug development programs have to worry about! But the possible advantage with some of these efforts is that some of them are going after targets that have amassed an impressive amount of biological rationale over the years without anyone being able to attack them successfully, along with the clear differences between inhibiting a protein&#39;s mechanism of action versus causing it to disappear completely from the cell. Any given protein has a list of other partners and other entire functions that are unlikely to be addressed by the binding of an active-site inhibitor alone, and cellular experiments have shown over and over that degraders can indeed be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we may not be all that far away from the first protein degrader to go in for FDA approval. I certainly hope so, and I hope that there are many to follow. And behind them, well, comes the huge host of other induced-proximity ideas waiting to be tried out. If you have enough imagination and nerve - well, and some money, too, can&#39;t deny that - you can go claim some of that latter territory yourself right now. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/induced-proximity-lab-and-clinic</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/induced-proximity-lab-and-clinic</guid><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2024 12:58:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Half-Full and Half-Empty AI Glasses</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03166-5&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; (associated commentary &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03289-9&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) is a bit out of scope for a biopharma commentary blog like this one, but it illustrates some very relevant points that apply across every field that is feeling the impacts of artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches. This work is about in vitro fertilization, and as is well known, IVF can be a labor-intensive and expensive process. Some of that labor is figuring out just which nascent embryos are the best candidates for implantation. There are a number of heuristics for judging this, and these definitely improve the chances of success, but even the best human judgments through the microscope still lead to an over 50% failure rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s been a lot of hope that AI/ML imaging techniques could improve on that. Here&#39;s where one has to make the usual observation that image recognition and processing is indeed one of the areas most suited to our current technology, since (1) the images themselves are already in digital form and (2) a vast amount of money and effort, no small amount of it originally from the defense and security sectors, has gone into just this sort of thing (discriminating and interpreting small differences in similar images). But there are still innumerable ways for things to go wrong. Readers will have come across some of the earlier examples of medical X-ray evaluation, where the software turned out to be sorting by the size of the files, their borders, and other useless-but-spuriously-predictive features instead of what you wanted them to be evaluating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper linked above is a head-to-head comparison (double-blinded, randomized) of the human-evaluated embryos versus ones evaluated by a state-of-the-art ML-driven imaging system. The results? 46.5% of the ML-evaluated embryos led to successful pregnancies, versus 48.2% of the human-evaluated ones (and those results are within error bars of each other). You can spin that several ways: the trial was designed to show noninferiority of the ML method, and it did not achieve that. So you can go with &quot;Machine Learning Was Not Better Than Human Judgment&quot; as your headline, and that is accurate. But you can also say &quot;Machine Learning Just As Good as Human Judgment&quot; for picking embryos, and that&#39;s accurate too. If you like, you can beat the drums for the machines and say &quot;Human Judgment Shown to Not Improve on Machine Learning&quot;, which is of course also true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some years back, the very fact that the two methods gave statistically indistinguishable results would have been big rise-of-the-machines news all by itself, but at this point, many people were thinking that the ML systems would turn out to be even better. In one key way, though, they were: the ML system took significantly less time to evaluate the embryos than the humans did. But as the commentary linked above points out, the ML-based system is also significantly more expensive, because it uses imaging-equipped time-lapse incubators, which are significantly more costly to buy and to operate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;These findings prompt the question of whether a reduction in labor expenses and an increase in laboratory efficiency justify the considerable additional costs for time-lapse incubators relative to conventional incubators. None of the aforementioned studies included a formal cost-effectiveness analysis. Moreover, who is accountable for protecting patients undergoing IVF from potential exploitation by profit-driven clinics? Competition between IVF centers can be fierce, and professionals often feel pressured to provide the latest technology to their patients. Consequently, decisions about which innovations to apply do not depend solely on scientific evidence — they are influenced by smart marketing, strong beliefs and hype.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed they are. For any application of a new technology you have to make your best call about where on the &quot;hype curve&quot; you are. It is still the inflated expectations phase, or not? And past that, you have to judge what that means for your overall decision. If you&#39;re buying into an AI/ML system, you have to decide if conditions right now mean that you&#39;re likely to be overpaying for it. On the other hand, if (for example) you&#39;re running an IVF clinic in a crowded market, perhaps it&#39;s better for you to lean into the &lt;em&gt;Latest AI Technology!&lt;/em&gt; angle in the hopes that you&#39;ll attract more customers (and be able to charge them accordingly). That is, using the inflated expectations to your own business advantage instead. Note that this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to the advantage of your patients (the customers), who will end up paying more for the same results that they could have had otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of biopharma companies are investing in these technologies, and for most of them, it&#39;s a prospective bet. No one&#39;s completely sure what the real capabilities are, but you want to have something in place in case they turn out to be useful. At the same time, you want to invest at a manageable level so that if things turn out to be not as useful as you&#39;d hoped, you haven&#39;t lost a catastrophic amount of money finding that out. It&#39;s in your best interest not to do that, but it&#39;s also in your best interest not to miss out on something great - which means that it&#39;s in the best interest of the AI sellers to whip up as much enthusiasm as possible about the possibilities (and as much fear as possible about missing out on them).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, there are in fact not very many slam-dunk gotta-get-me-some-of-that-AI decisions out there in our business. But of course capabiliities are changing all the time, thus all those prospective bets. You don&#39;t pass the ball far downfield to exactly where the other person is at the moment - you pass it to where they&#39;re likely going to be by the time it gets there. How many of these long passes are going end up scoring, versus the ones that end up uselessly bouncing across the field - that&#39;s the (unaswerable) question. This current IVF example shows just how difficult such calls can be.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/half-full-and-half-empty-ai-glasses</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/half-full-and-half-empty-ai-glasses</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 11:53:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Long, Slow Stories</title><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the tricky parts about covering biopharma research (and one of the tricky parts about trying to fund it or manage it!) is that it works on several time scales at once. I&#39;ll illustrate that with several recent news items. There are sudden events like the success or failure of a clinical trial, and there was a good example of that earlier this week. A small company called Scholar Rock said that it had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/scholar-rocks-phase-3-sma-trial-hits-goal-catapulting-stock-200&quot;&gt;successful outcome&lt;/a&gt; in a trial for spinal muscle atrophy, and the company&#39;s stock more than tripled in value in that day&#39;s trading. Naturally, the trial had been in the works for some time, but news like this always hits instantly - which is not always good for understanding it when it does! In this case (as that link shows), although the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apitegromab&quot;&gt;company&#39;s antibody&lt;/a&gt; cleared the primary endpoint, it did not quite hit its stated efficacy goal, and they managed to gloss over not announcing the results at all for a key secondary endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time scale for such clinical trials is in the weeks-to-months range, but the overall drug discovery work is on the scale of years, which makes it hard to rate how well any give research organization is doing. A big management change usually brings in a new approach and a reorganization, but often enough the new team itself (or the new philosophy itself) has itself disappeared before it would have had time to have an effect all through the pipeline. If you&#39;re making big changes to the really early-stage R&amp;amp;D efforts, you can expect to see the effects in the clinic (or at the FDA) in what? Eight or ten years? Longer? Very few people look at these situations in that sort of time frame. Every new management team ends up getting evaluated partly (or mostly) on how they play the extensive array of cards they were dealt before they sat down at the table. I have never seen an overlay for a big pharma organization that simultaneously laid out over twenty years or so all the management changes and their stated goals along with the timelines of all the projects (the ones that eventually got approved, and the ones that were killed or failed). It might be instructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another very slow-moving area is patent litigation. Take a look at the mRNA field for a good example - I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/formulating-rna---and-owning-it&quot;&gt;back in 2020&lt;/a&gt; about how the cases in this area had already been going on for years, and gave &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/mrna-vaccine-patent-fight-expands&quot;&gt;another update&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. Those blog posts are nowhere near definitive, of course - a full accounting of the litigation in this area would be very, very long and incredibly tedious. But since it&#39;s two years later, I will note that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/uk-court-gives-mixed-ruling-pfizer-v-moderna-covid-vaccine-patents-case-2024-07-02/&quot;&gt;back in July&lt;/a&gt; there was a (mixed) ruling in the UK courts in the litigation between Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna (which has itself spawned appeals). And just this week, Pfizer and BioNTech were able to invalidate a CureVac patent in a UK court, but I assume that will be appealed as well. Similar litigation has been taking place in both German and US courts, and each of those will have their own twists and turns. I think we can confidently say that none of this dust will really settle for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legislation is not one of your faster-moving areas either, although it&#39;s still a lot zippier than patent litigation. I last wrote about the BioSecure act &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/biosecure-act-moves-along&quot;&gt;about a month ago&lt;/a&gt;, and since then things have gotten. . .a bit murky. Later on in September, the act was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; added to the consensus version of a large defense bill (as some had thought it might be), a step that would basically have ensured its passage. &lt;em&gt;BioCentury&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biocentury.com/article/653635/another-twist-in-the-biosecure-drama-leaves-bill-s-fate-uncertain&quot;&gt;covered this&lt;/a&gt;, but also noted that the language could still be added to the FY25 National Defense Authorization Act at a later point. That&#39;s a less-likely route at this point, but not an impossible one (but as far as I can see, there&#39;s been no push to do it). The act could also be wedged into some must-pass spending bill, and it so happens that we still have one of those coming up, since the House and Senate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2024/09/25/g-s1-24518/stopgap-funding-bill-congress&quot;&gt;managed to kick the can&lt;/a&gt; on spending out to December 20th. That post-election session is going to be quite a mess, in all likelihood, and you can interpret that two ways: that no one will have time for the BioSecure Act at all, or that there could hardly be a better moment to quietly slip it through. At any rate, several influential legislators seem to have objections to the way the bill is worded, so if I had to guess, I think it&#39;s going to disappear in its current form without being passed. We shall see.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/long-slow-stories</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/long-slow-stories</guid><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2024 09:19:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Coronavirus Vaccination: Room for Improvement</title><description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/vaccines-past-and-present&quot;&gt;paean to vaccines&lt;/a&gt; the other day, I mentioned that one of the things that we&#39;re starting to get a handle on are the factors that make for a longer-lasting immunization. That comes to mind today in light &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03278-y&quot;&gt;of this paper&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to explain why the current coronavirus vaccines do not provide protection for as long a period as all of us would like. &lt;em&gt;Update: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/article/missing-immune-cells-may-explain-why-covid-19-vaccine-protection-quickly-wanes#:~:text=Missing%20immune%20cells%20may%20explain%20why%20COVID%2D19%20vaccine%20protection%20quickly%20wanes&quot;&gt;here&#39;s a piece&lt;/a&gt; here at Science on this work as well!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me say up front that I have been vaccinated/boosted at every opportunity, partly because of changes in the circulating strains of the virus and partly because of just this antibody-waning effect, which has been noted ever since the initial months after the first vaccines were introduced in the pandemic. I have had the virus more than once, but have never experienced severe symptoms, and in fact went antigen-test-clear within the week in my last bout. I think that vaccination has helped lead to fewer cases of disease and a trend toward milder symptoms, both of which the world has needed a great deal. (It should be noted that the vaccines do provoke long-lasting T-cell responses, although not long-lasting antibody titers). But the dream of a pandemic-erasing vaccine (sterilizing immunity) with strong multiyear protection has not been realized, all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper linked above takes a set of vaccinated patients and does a closeup look at their plasma cell population. These are the antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) of the immune system, and they come in a rather wide variety. You have the plasmablasts (pretty much the first population of these), and then you develop a heterogeneous mix referred to as &quot;plasma cells&quot;, of which a subset are the &quot;long-lived plasma cells&quot; (LLPCs) which are distinguished by a particular suite of surface proteins (CD19&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; CD38&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; CD138&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, if you&#39;re wondering). These are the ones that sit around in your bone marrow for years, waiting to see if that particular antigen ever shows up again. Things like the polio and smallpox vaccines produce these, and you can also find circulating B cells in the blood that retain such memory. A spectacular example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2848880&quot;&gt;in the blood of people&lt;/a&gt; who survived the 1918 flu pandemic, who were still seroreactive 90 years later (as opposed to the 4 to 6 month protection afforded by the yearly flu vaccines). It&#39;s a spectrum - that&#39;s why there are recommended boosters for tetanus immunity every ten years, because that&#39;s about the time scale that the protection wanes for that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact route by which the initial plasma cells turn into LLPCs is still being worked out, but what&#39;s known is that most of these are destined to die off (apoptosis) unless they find their way into specific compartments in the bone marrow that promote their survival. Even then, it seems that not every ASC has the potential to do this successfully - there are some sort of early imprinting events that make this more or less likely, but the details are still not clear. So just taking a bone marrow sample &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; isn&#39;t necessarily enough: people who&#39;ve received the coronavirus vaccines have shown evidence of plasma cells in that tissue, but there hasn&#39;t been enough detailed follow-up to see what types of cells those were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s the the current authors have done, to extend previous studies that did not go out to longer time periods and did not always go into enough cellular detail, and they find a notable lack of LLPCs. The controls were the number of LLPCs for tetanus and for previous wild-type flu infections, and the subjects of the study displayed those just fine, although they varied between different cohorts in the overall test population. There was no trend with how long it had been since coronavirus vaccination, nor between those who had just had vaccine or vaccine plus wild-type infection. That last result suggests (as results out in the real world would indicate) that being infected with the virus itself does not elicit long-lasting plasma cells, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patients in this study all were vaccinated with mRNA vaccines, but the authors note that the profiles seem to be very close to the existing data on people who had adenovirus-vector coronavirus vaccines as well. The experience of populations who received these vaccines also makes it very much seem like they do not have a good LLPC response, either. All of this put together makes you conclude that it&#39;s not the type of vaccine that makes the difference, and it&#39;s not vaccine-versus-natural-infection, either: it&#39;s a property of the coronavirus itself and its antigen proteins (and our response to them). Here are the authors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could the limited durability of neutralizing antibody responses be due to the widely spaced structural nature of the spike protein itself and, thus, limited only to coronavirus vaccines? Coronaviruses lack highly repetitive organized structures or pathogen-associated structural patterns (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-020-00264-6&quot;&gt;ref. 50&lt;/a&gt;). Most RNA viruses that induce long-lasting antibody immunity have on their surface rigid repetitive structures spaced at 5–10 nm (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00956/full&quot;&gt;ref. 51&lt;/a&gt;). For coronaviruses, the long spike proteins are embedded in a fluid membrane, which are often loosely floating and widely spaced at 25 nm apart (ref. 50. Therefore, the inherent nature of the spike protein itself may be an issue in B cell activation (ref. 51) since neutralizing antibody responses to seasonal human coronaviruses, as well as to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, are also short-lived.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to see if we can find a way around these factors - this isn&#39;t going to be the only coronavirus that ever gives us trouble, and there are surely others out there with similar features. More immunology, please!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/coronavirus-vaccination-room-improvement</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/coronavirus-vaccination-room-improvement</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2024 12:13:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The 2024 Chemistry Nobel: Computational Protein Design</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/&quot;&gt;2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry&lt;/a&gt; has gone to David Baker (of the University of Washington) and to Demis Hassabis and John M. Jumper of Google/DeepMind for computational prediction of protein structures. This is one of those awards that is not really a surprise - as the abilities of these methods have become clear, the phrase &quot;protein folding problem&quot; has begun to disappear from the language as a reference to some huge, intractable feat. As always, I can recommend the Nobel site&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/advanced-information/&quot;&gt;scientific summary&lt;/a&gt;, but my own take is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have written many times about this field, so here&#39;s a quick journey through the blog, before I summarize things just for this post. The world began to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/latest-protein-folding&quot;&gt;take notice of this technology in 2018&lt;/a&gt; with the results of the CASP protein folding competition, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/protein-folding-2020&quot;&gt;here&#39;s my post&lt;/a&gt; after the 2020 competition. Here&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/more-protein-folding-progress---what-s-it-mean&quot;&gt;a follow-up&lt;/a&gt; in 2021. I&#39;ve done other posts as the software has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/alphafold-3-debuts&quot;&gt;evolved&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(and the techniques &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/computational-combo&quot;&gt;for using it&lt;/a&gt;). Even during this period, I was doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/big-problems&quot;&gt;occasional posts&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/alphafold-excitement&quot;&gt;connection of this work&lt;/a&gt; to drug discovery, a series that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/alphafold-s-place-world&quot;&gt;has continued&lt;/a&gt;, since it&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/docking-alphafold-structures-oops&quot;&gt;obviously&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/screening-against-alphafold-models-maybe-better-it-looks&quot;&gt;big topic&lt;/a&gt; indeed. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/ai-and-biology&quot;&gt;most recent&lt;/a&gt; post in this area was on the general topic of applying AI/ML techniques to biological problems, which (to be fair) is not what today&#39;s award really concerns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein folding had the reputation it did for a lot of good reasons! Even from the earliest days of understanding actual protein structures, it was clear that there were certain repeating motifs in them (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_helix&quot;&gt;alpha-helix&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_sheet&quot;&gt;beta-pleated sheet&lt;/a&gt;, for starters), and that there were sets of particular folds and turns that tended to connect such regions. These patterns made it clear that protein structure was far from a random process, but it did not lead to as much progress as hoped for in making detailed predictions. There are a finite number of such structural motifs, but it is still not a small number, and the combinations that they occur in (and their subtle effects on the resulting protein conformations) are not easy to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the place to note that such small differences in the placement of side chains and protein backbones can indeed add up to big effects. You can see this clearly in the field of point mutations, where one amino acid gets switched for another. Most of these changes are silent: the mutated protein functions pretty much like the original one. But the nonsilent ones can be very, very meaningful. My favorite example is APP, the &quot;Alzheimer&#39;s Precursor Protein&quot;, from whence derives the famous beta-amyloid protein that is precipitated out in the brains of AD patients. APP has seven hundred and fifty-one amino acids in it, and number six hundred and ninety-three is a glutamic acid. If that one is replaced by a glutamine (that is, if the last atoms in the side chain are changed from an OH to an NH2), you are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alzforum.org/mutations/app-e693q-dutch&quot;&gt;fated to die&lt;/a&gt; in your 50s from unstoppable amyloid-driven cerebrovascular disease. One atom&#39;s worth of difference. So you can imagine that having a side chain that pokes out &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; way instead of over &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; way, or a turn that goes around a bit harder over &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; than you thought might throw things off considerably when you&#39;re using a modeled protein structure, and so it can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways that people had been trying to deal with this problem was from the ground up, computing values for things like torsional angles, hydrogen bonding, pi-pi electronic interactions, bond strain energies and all the rest of it and trying to see what the energy minima looked like. That&#39;s a fearsome task for a large protein, so these approaches always included shortcuts of the &quot;insert standard alpha-helix structure here and work from that&quot; type. But the programs that are the subject of today&#39;s prize (AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold) eschewed a lot of the physics. Instead, they built on the ever-growing number of real-world protein structures as deposited in the Protein Data Bank (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rcsb.org/&quot;&gt;PDB&lt;/a&gt;), using advances in sheer hardware processing power and (very importantly) advances in machine learning algorithms to work out the patterns of protein structure versus protein sequence at a depth never before achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern-matching approach has worked spectacularly well, as witness today&#39;s prize. These programs rapidly outdistanced the competing approaches (physics-based, other pattern-matching attempts, hybrids of all sorts) when it came to predicting protein structures from sequences alone. If you&#39;d told someone in the 1970s or 80s where we are today with such results, they probably would have decided that we learned an awful lot of physics during the intervening years, but basically we shortcutted across that part. The biannual CASP competition I mentioned earlier set teams to working on proteins whose structures had been recently determined by experiment but which had &lt;em&gt;not yet been publicly revealed&lt;/em&gt;, making it a very stringent test. And these new ML programs were clearly very promising in the 2018 era and flat-out overwhelming by 2020. The latest refinements (as in AlphaFold 3) have been in using &quot;diffusion&quot; techniques to zero in on structures, but this also depends fundamentally on knowing a lot of existing protein structures and getting the software to send you towards things that look like them. (Having the PDB data, a very large, very well curated set of real-world data &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/give-me-those-hard-hard-numbers&quot;&gt;has been crucial&lt;/a&gt; to getting all this to work). The resulting structures are often very good indeed - not always perfect, of course (&lt;em&gt;bonus dormitat Homerus&lt;/em&gt;), but extremely useful for further modeling, for comparison to other proteins, and for interpreting real-world data from things like X-ray diffraction and cryo-electron microscopy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been clear for several years that a Nobel was in the offing for this work, and it looks like the committees have decided that this is the AI/ML year. I can&#39;t blame them, nor can I really argue with them. Protein structure prediction by itself has been a real gift to research, and the implications of having these abilities are honestly still sinking in. But here&#39;s where I note that in my own field (drug discovery) that knowing what a protein looks like is not equivalent to having a drug that affects its function. Nor does it always speed that process up by as much as you would hope! There was a lot of hype at first about how drug discovery was going to take this huge leap forward, as if all that had been holding us back was lack of knowledge of protein structure, but that&#39;s very much overstated for a number of reasons. Proteins move around, for one thing, and change shapes as they perform their functions (and as they bind to drug molecules). The energetics of those binding events are balanced in very tricky ways, and small differences are very meaningful indeed. We&#39;re getting better at it all the time, but we still can&#39;t just tap some keyboard commands and tell the software to go find a new structure that will be a nanomolar-level binder to the pocket that we point at. Far from it. And even if we had that ability, the gap between a nice potent binder and an actual drug is still substantial (blood levels, stability, side effects, toxicology and other factors are still waiting for you at that point!). Not to mention our ability to pick the right pocket on the right proteins in the right cellular pathways to affect some disease in the first place, which believe me, still needs a vast amount of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the end, it&#39;s beside the point that robust protein structure prediction can&#39;t suddenly deliver drugs, because the people who thought that it would didn&#39;t really understand the problems involved. It can deliver a lot of other extremely useful things, and it&#39;s given us powers that we&#39;ve never had (not least, the prospect of designing proteins that would never have evolved on their own at all). This has been a tremendous scientific achievement, and the prize is well-deserved. Congratulations to all involved!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/2024-chemistry-nobel-computational-protein-design</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/2024-chemistry-nobel-computational-protein-design</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 09:25:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Cryo-EM to the Rescue</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I think that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(24)00885-7&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; represents a first, although the overall technique calls back to an earlier era. Back In The Day, meaning &quot;before molecular biology&quot;, microscopy (optical and electron) was one of the primary ways that you identified a particular infectious organism (bacterial in the former case, viral in the latter). But here&#39;s a modern example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes from the farmed mealworm industry (in this case, the closely related &quot;superworm&quot;, larval stage of the beetle &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zophobas_morio&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zophobas morio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These are common foods for pet reptiles, birds, and fish, and are produced on a rather large scale for this purpose. (Interestingly, these are also the creatures that have been found to be able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9455710/&quot;&gt;eat and digest&lt;/a&gt; straight polystyrene, which I find pretty impressive). But an unknown disease was sweeping the &lt;em&gt;Z. morio&lt;/em&gt; business, and the authors here helped out by direct methods: they took deceased larvae, homogenized them and ran the material through a sucrose &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugation#Density_gradient_centrifugation&quot;&gt;gradient fractionation&lt;/a&gt;, and spread the resulting material on cryo-electron microscopy grids. The hope was that some viral pathogen might be present in enough concentration to stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it did! Spherical viral particles were very apparent in the cryo-EM scans. That didn&#39;t narrow things down enough, though, since there are a lot of roughly spherical viruses out there. (A weirdo &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filoviridae&quot;&gt;Filovirus&lt;/a&gt; shape, on the other hand, would have been instantly diagnostic). But as it turned out, the resolution of the viral particles themselves was high enough to make a lot of progress. There were two bands, a lighter one that had empty virion particle in it, and a heavier one where the virons had their DNA payload. Manually tracing the protein backbone from the data showed that the capsid exhibited a pronounced PV fold, and a homology search in published structures returned three viruses as hits. Every one of them was in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Densovirinae&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Densovirinae&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; subfamily of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvoviridae&quot;&gt;parvoviruses&lt;/a&gt;, which is pretty strong evidence. (The authors also showed that this result could be obtained by less labor-intensive automated software searching as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This identification was crucial to the sequencing in the next step, because parvoviruses are linear single-stranded DNA all the way. That&#39;s a very poor fit for the usual ligase-driven next-generation-sequencing workflow, but a transposase-dependent method can handle it (and did!) That identified the pathogen as specifically a new type of Blattambidensovirus (one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambidensovirus&quot;&gt;six related genera&lt;/a&gt; of the densoviruses), and multiple other samples of diseased larvae from around the country showed the same infection with several slightly different strains of virus. Introduction of the isolated virus to uninfected specimens led to the exact same disease, and historical samples suggest that it was spreading by at least 2019 in some regions. Bleach treatment of the facilities/equipment and culling of the larvae seem to be sufficient to restart things (ethanol wiping isn&#39;t enough!), but the virus can be assumed to be endemic in North America, based on the wide range of positive samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors even saw signs of less-virulent strains being able to provide some protection against the more-virulent ones (this although beetles don&#39;t have an antibody-based immune response), but it&#39;s not clear yet if a truly protective virus could be developed. Another possibly interesting side note was the structure of the viral capsids: they do a better job than expected of giving a larger cargo volume for their overall size due to an interesting protein fold, and the authors suggest that this might be worth trying to engineer into AAV virions that are being studied as therapeutic agents for gene therapy delivery, vaccines, and more. But what I found immediately striking was the one-shot identification of the pathogen from. . .looking at it. Closely, the modern way!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/cryo-em-rescue</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/cryo-em-rescue</guid><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 12:00:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A Nobel for MicroRNA</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The 2024 Nobel Prize in Medicine/Physiology &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2024/press-release/&quot;&gt;has gone to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;Victor Ambros (of the UMass Medical School) and Gary Ruvkun (of Harvard) for the discovery of micro-RNAs. This is a solid award indeed, and highlights the way that RNA has been sort of taking over the world in recent decades. As I&#39;ve mentioned here before, back in the ancient days when I was first learning biology, we all knew about messenger RNA, transfer RNA, and ribosomal RNA (although we didn&#39;t think about that last one very much). But since then there&#39;s been an explosion in the number of different RNA species that we have realized are important in cellular function, and micro RNAs are a big part of that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As usual, the Nobel folks have done a very good job &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2024/advanced-information/&quot;&gt;on the scientific information&lt;/a&gt;. As they note, in many ways this prize is a follow-on to the work by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/sydney-brenner-1927-2019&quot;&gt;Sydney Brenner,&lt;/a&gt; John Sulston, and Robert Horvitz that won the Nobel in 2002. That was for the use of the nematode &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; as a model organism in biology, and the nematode has been a gift that keeps on giving. Ambros was a post-doc in the Horvitz lab investigating some mutant strains with very odd developmental defects that suggested problems with timing in gene expression. Ruvkan joined these efforts himself in his own postdoc with Horvitz. They spent a great deal of time and effort trying to clone a particular nematode gene (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1316966/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;lin-14&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that was associated with some of these mutants, and because it was the 1980s it took years of painstaking effort. Both Ambros and Ruvkan continued this work as they moved into their faculty positions (same institutions as today!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;lin-14&lt;/em&gt; turned out to code for a nuclear protein that had profound effects on gene regulation, and closer examination of related mutants showed that there were both loss-of-function ones and gain-of-function as well. But those latter mutations were out at the far 3&#39; end of the sequence and had no effect on the protein itself, which suggested that there was some sort of RNA-level effect that wasn&#39;t showing up as an alteration in the nuclear protein&#39;s sequence - something to do with stability, localization, or the like (it wasn&#39;t clear at the time, of course).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, Ambros and his co-workers were working on another of the mutants, &lt;em&gt;lin-4&lt;/em&gt;. In contrast to &lt;em&gt;lin-14&lt;/em&gt;, this one seemed, as they dug into it further, to be less and less likely to be coding for an actual protein. The &quot;business parts&quot; of the sequence were just too short, leading to the idea that these short noncoding RNA sequences were where the effects operated. And when Ambros and Ruvkan compared the sequences of these (which can be dated to a conversation on June 11, 1992!), they found that these stories converged in a very interesting way: the two had stretches of complementary base pairs that strongly suggested that &lt;em&gt;lin-4&lt;/em&gt; microRNA could and would bind to the &lt;em&gt;lin-14&lt;/em&gt; messenger RNA - and not smack in the middle of its coding region, but out at the 3&#39; end of it. That&#39;s the same part where gain-of-function mutants showed up: there really &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; something going on out there in an RNA regulatory sense, and it turns out that another RNA species (the lin-4 microRNA) was the means by which it was happening. The two labs collaborated on a series of experiments to prove this hypothesis and published back-to-back papers on it in 1993. I won&#39;t go into the details of those here, but things lined up beautifully in that rare way that tells you that yes, yes, you are definitely on to something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But was that something just peculiar to &lt;em&gt;lin-14&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;lin-4&lt;/em&gt;, and more than that, was it just peculiar to nematodes? The &lt;em&gt;lin-4&lt;/em&gt; sequence, it turned out, was only found in them and in no other animals. It took years to find another such microRNA example just in the roundworms. &lt;em&gt;let-7&lt;/em&gt; had a lot of similarities in its mechanism of action: it bound to particular mRNA sequences for a number of important nematode genes and affected their function strongly. That was very encouraging news, suggesting that this mechanism was a general one, and what was even more telling was that the let-7 sequence (or something very close to it) shows up in a &lt;em&gt;whole range of other animals&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That went from model organisms like fruit flies and zebrafish all the way to humans, and further experiments showed that yes indeed, this microRNA system was involved in timing of gene expression in cells from all of these organisms. In fact, it seemed to be a very important part of the gene expression machinery in every creature with left/right symmetry in their bodies. That&#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triploblasty&quot;&gt;very deep evolutionary cut&lt;/a&gt; indeed, going back to pre-Cambrian times, and that would mean that micro RNA regulation has been a conserved feature of living cells the whole time. No, this was definitely not Just A Nematode Thing - it was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cell-and-developmental-biology/articles/10.3389/fcell.2020.00409/full&quot;&gt;fundamental part&lt;/a&gt; of life on Earth, and no one had realized that it was operating at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And that, folks, is what a Nobel Prize-worthy discovery looks like. In the years since, a tremendous amount of work has gone into this area, greatly accelerated by the advances in molecular biology techniques over the years. The sort of work that took Ruvkan and Ambros years back in the early days can be zipped through at great speed, which means that the ways have been opened to the sorts of experiments that couldn&#39;t have even been dreamed of back then. It&#39;s really hard to overstate how much more capable we are as a species with molecular biology and its subdisciplines (genomics, proteomics &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;.) than we were in the late 1980s; it&#39;s like going from the first demonstration of the Wright Flyer on a North Carolina beach to your choice of hundreds of scheduled flights around the world powered by high-efficiency turbofan engines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those techniques have allowed us to work out the many complex pathways in microRNA generation and function. As befits something that cells have been optimizing for over a billion years, there are whole suites of proteins devoted to the production and processing of various sorts of microRNAs, which have profound effects on expression patterns throughout the genome. You cannot hope to understand the pathways of embryonic development &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5617922/&quot;&gt;without reference&lt;/a&gt; to these mechanisms, and in adult animals malfunctions of these are involved in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jmaj.jp/detail.php?id=10.31662%2Fjmaj.2023-0009&quot;&gt;many disease states&lt;/a&gt;. These are also connected other huge areas of cell biology such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference&quot;&gt;RNA interference&lt;/a&gt;, which is another reason I talk about RNA taking over the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Congratulations to all involved! And of course there are many more than the two people cited on the prize. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3653358/&quot;&gt;This 2013 interview&lt;/a&gt; with Prof. Ambros will give you the idea, starting with the fact that the first author on one of those key papers was his wife, Rosalind. It&#39;s all been part of a revolution in our understanding of living cells, and it&#39;s a great accomplishment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/nobel-microrna</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/nobel-microrna</guid><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2024 01:11:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Vaccines, Past and Present</title><description>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(24)00781-5&quot;&gt;a nice overview&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; on vaccine history and new areas that are being explored.

We have wiped out smallpox as a disease, one that had been dreaded all the way back to prehistory. We are tantilizingly close to doing the same with polio. Other diseases that used to be a common feature of life (especially for children) are now rare and hardly thought of, because of broad vaccination programs starting in infancy. The amount of disability and outright premature death that has been avoided by these efforts over the last century is nearly beyond calculation: we life in a different and far better world because of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s what makes anti-vaccine activism so frustrating. People have been suspicious of the whole idea of vaccination ever since the beginning, but the toxic skepticism really seems to have increased in recent years, reaching a crescendo during the coronavirus pandemic. The first outright anti-vaxxer I ever encountered was in about 1992, and I was baffled - I thought I was talking to someone through some kind of time portal that opened up to a hundred years before. Little did I realize! The populations of the industrialized nations have forgotten (or never known at all) what all these diseases used to do, and imagine things like measles, pertussis, and rubella to be breezy little fevers that used to make kids miss a day or two of school before they were all good as new. (You really can find anti-vaccine folks talking exactly like that). And to avoid these wholesome natural rites of childhood, you want to let evil drug companies inject horrible concoctions into perfect little babies? Defiling them forever? Get those toxin-laden syringes out of here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out here in reality, though, progress in vaccines has gone from Edward Jenner&#39;s pioneering cowpox vaccination against smallpox (which replaced the effective but more dangerous technique of variolation), through Koch and Pasteur in the 1800s and the realization that microorganisms were the cause of these disease. Viral cultures became more feasible in the 1930s and 40s, and the later improvements in cell culture techniques led to the vaccines against polio, measles, mumps, rubella and many more. These were generally killed-microorganism or live-attenenuated vaccines, but later work developed the idea of polysaccharides and polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines, which is where we get the vaccines against &lt;em&gt;Pneumococcus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;H. influenzae&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular biology&#39;s greater and great ability to provide recombinant proteins has led to vaccines against hepatitis B, shingles, HPV and replaced the older pertussis vaccine entirely. The HPV vaccination campaign was the subject of a dramatic recent report from Scotland, showing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/25/hpv-vaccine-prevent-cervical-cancer-cervarix-gardasil-study/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;not one single case&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of cervical cancer has been diagnosed so far in women who got the shots at a young enough age. We have also learned how to sequence genomes faster and more accurately than anyone could have imagined, and genomics has let the way to a number of new vaccines by identifying antigen sequences to test. Outright protein structure and protein design work led to the RSV vaccine (a disease that had eluded all other attempts for decades), and all the techniques of modern analytical chemistry, molecular biology, and chemical biology are being enlisted simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was certainly displayed during the coronavirus vaccine efforts. We have entered the mRNA vaccine era, which was coming on anyway but was profoundly accelerated by the pandemic, and nothing could have gone anywhere near as quickly if we didn&#39;t have our modern abilities in these areas. And these are provided a huge boost to two other fields outside infectious disease: immune tolerance and cancer treatment. We are moving toward being able to treat hypersensitivity to environmental antigens (peanut, stinging insects, etc.) which are life-threatening for those who suffer from them, and finally (after decades of work) the idea of direct vaccination therapy against some forms of cancer seems really possible, through targeting &quot;neoantigens&quot; present on tumor cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the article shows, we&#39;re also making real strides in predicting what sorts of antigens will produce better responses (fewer side effects and greater duration, even up to lifelong protection). This is all part of the growing knowledge of the (tremendously complex) immune system in general - the interplay between subtypes of T cells and B cells and antibody activity that has been coming into focus thanks to proteomic profiling and single-cell sequencing techniques, among others. I was glad to see that the authors also addressed what&#39;s often an overlooked area that&#39;s shown great improvement, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/enhancing-enhancers-vaccines&quot;&gt;adjuvants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re living in an extraordinary time for vaccine research, in so many ways. It&#39;s a terrible thing that some of this is due to the acceleration seen during the pandemic, but at least that seems to have shaken many people (and organizations, and governments) out of what in retrospect was in some cases a sense of complacency about infectious disease. The harnessing of the immune system so far has already been a huge for the human race, and there&#39;s a lot more to come!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/vaccines-past-and-present</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/vaccines-past-and-present</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2024 10:45:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Helpful Robot Assistants Will Fake It For You</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Y&#39;know, the topic of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/fraud-so-much-fraud&quot;&gt;fraudulent research&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/cassava-revisited&quot;&gt;coming up a lot&lt;/a&gt; here recently, so I wanted to bring up one more aspect of the problem while it&#39;s on my mind. So many of these cases have turned on faked graphical representations of data - Western blots that have been cut-&#39;n-pasted to say just what you want them to say without any of that inconvenient Other Stuff, photomicrographs of cells and tissue slices that illustrate Great Things Happening where they actually weren&#39;t. That sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And these have been relatively easy to spot, when you actually bear down and try to spot them. One of the big reasons that they haven&#39;t been is a sort of presumption of scientific innocence, of good faith. As has been said here and in many other places, when you review a manuscript that a journal has sent you for possible publication, you tend to ask questions like: Do these data fit the conclusions that the authors are drawing? Have the right experiments been run and are they presented in enough detail to be believable and reproducible? Are the conclusions statistically plausible? Are there other possible explanations that the authors are overlooking? If so, are there experiments that could be run to nail those loose ends down? Have they fairly represented the state of the art, and cited the relevant papers so that someone could use this paper to get a foothold on the literature in this area?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we &lt;em&gt;don&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; tend to ask is: Are the authors flat-out lying? Did they make all this stuff up? Are these Western blots actually mosaics of six others, slapped together by software manipulation to illustrate a so-called definitive experiment that wasn&#39;t even run in the first place? Are there blobs of duplicated pasted stuff scattered through those pictures of the cells, to make it look as if something worked when nothing ever did? And those graphs - are they maybe the same damn graphs that the authors have published before, in other journals, to illustrate other supposed data, but just recycled with the labels changed? Well, &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are very different questions, and they come from a different place entirely. You can see why we don&#39;t (or haven&#39;t been) approaching manuscripts from that direction, because if we&#39;re going to have to do that, then you have two separate labor-intensive review tasks in front of your for each paper. I mean, if you assume good faith, the workload diminishes greatly. First you&#39;d need a forensic criminal report on the presence of fakery - then, if the paper passes that, you do the traditional internal-scientific-consistency stuff. Problem is, if you skip the first step a well-faked paper is probably going to pass that second review and get published. After all, if the authors are making stuff up, they&#39;ll make it up in a way that gives them a solid-looking manuscript with well-supported conclusions, right? That&#39;s how so much of this gets through - see that terrible &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/fraud-so-much-fraud&quot;&gt;Masliah example&lt;/a&gt; for a painful illustration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, when I say &quot;relatively easy to spot&quot;, that&#39;s once you take off your &lt;em&gt;we&#39;re-all-scientists-here&lt;/em&gt; glasses and put on your &lt;em&gt;keep-your-hands-where-I-can-see-them&lt;/em&gt; ones. When you start looking for deliberate duplications you have a decent chance of seeing them; they have to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kuer.org/science-technology/2013-08-23/u-investigates-alleged-fraud-in-chemical-engineering-department&quot;&gt;really egregious&lt;/a&gt; to leap out at you if you&#39;re not thinking about fraud in the first place. You get better with practice, and there are some people (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Bik&quot;&gt;Elisabeth Bik&lt;/a&gt;!) who are very good at it indeed. There are software solutions these days that assist with finding duplications in figures, too. But is all that about to go away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say that because of the rise of AI-generated fakery. Bik herself told me when I spoke with her earlier this year that she&#39;s very worried about this, and you can see why. Think about it: fakery is what AI image-generating systems do; it&#39;s their entire &lt;em&gt;raison d&#39;être&lt;/em&gt;. You give them prompts so that they will whip up something plausible, something that looks like what you wanted. So whip me up a good looking Western blot, or maybe just a selection of good-looking bands that I can use in my Frankensteined Westerns where they won&#39;t appear duplicated! Here, imaging model, here&#39;s a big pile of stained tissue slice images - make me some more that look like that, only with the features in them that I want people to think that I actually had. You can do that for me, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right. They can. And I&#39;m sure they are, right now. And they are going to be &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; harder to pick up. This is part of the general problem of AI-generated slop contaminating things - a good example is the open-source effort to use text from the internet to determine the frequency of word usage in English. It&#39;s now &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/09/20/1745236/project-analyzing-human-language-usage-shuts-down-because-generative-ai-has-polluted-the-data&quot;&gt;been shut down&lt;/a&gt;, because there is too much AI-generated content out there skewing the results. There are now piles of AI-generated books being published, full of remasticated trash written in reasonably grammatical sentences, and if you use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/01/mushroom-pickers-urged-to-avoid-foraging-books-on-amazon-that-appear-to-be-written-by-ai&quot;&gt;mushroom identification guide&lt;/a&gt; churned out in this manner you are taking your life in your hands. And now we get to experience this lovely effect in the scientific literature: a tidal wave of superficially attractive gibberish, with the actually worthwhile information gradually dissolving in it. We&#39;re all going to regret this.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/helpful-robot-assistants-will-fake-it-you</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/helpful-robot-assistants-will-fake-it-you</guid><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2024 10:46:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Cassava Revisited</title><description>&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Just about a year ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/saga-cassava&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;I wrote here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about Cassava Biosciences. It&#39;s a pretty tangled story, and I won&#39;t try to recapitulate it all in this post. But it&#39;s about their drug candidate &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simufilam&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;simufilam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and whether it&#39;s a viable Alzheimer&#39;s therapy or not. The problem is that the research behind the drug, and the idea of targeting a brain protein called filamin in general, is based on a series of papers from a group at CUNY and other associated researchers that have come under a great deal of scrutiny for what strongly appears to be altered data (Western blots and more).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;My post last year got a fair amount of feedback, as articles about the company have tended to. The stock has some very vocal fans, hoping that the company really does have a breakthrough Alzheimer&#39;s drug, and Cassava&#39;s management has not been shy about defending themselves, either. Indeed, I heard from them myself. And none of these parties take well to having the company, the drug, or the research behind it criticized - the tone you get ranges from &quot;&lt;em&gt;You may not be aware that&lt;/em&gt;. . .&quot; through &quot;&lt;em&gt;How dare you&lt;/em&gt;&quot; all the way down to &quot;&lt;em&gt;What short sellers are paying you off, you scum&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Well, the year that has passed has not been kind to those points of view. CUNY had an investigation going into the work from Hoau-Yan Wang&#39;s lab, but this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/action/Hoau-Yan%20Wang&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;was paused&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the university after a draft document was leaked (and that&#39;s about the time I wrote that post linked above. Wang&#39;s refusal (or inability) to provide original data to the investigation also made its work difficult to conclude. But this was all after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/article/damning-fda-inspection-report-undermines-positive-trial-results-possible-alzheimer-s&quot;&gt;an FDA inspection&lt;/a&gt; of the lab&#39;s work on Cassava&#39;s clinical candidate in 2022, a visit that&amp;nbsp; did not go well. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.z7wo4zp/full/fda_cuny_inspectionreport91422to91622-1710956817103.pdf&quot;&gt;read the FDA report here&lt;/a&gt;, but the bottom line is that the inspectors found numerous deficiences in how equipment, samples, and data were handled, and the conclusion was that the data from the lab cannot be trusted. There were other problems, starting with how CUNY initially barred the FDA from inspecting the premises at all:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot; style=&quot;padding-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;I was first greeted in Room 200 by ___, Assistant to Executive Counsel, and ____, Assistant to Executive Counsel. I presented my credentials to Ms.___ and she asked me to identify the subject of our investigation. When I informed her I could not divulge details until I was given the opportunity to issue a Notice of Inspection (Form FDA 482), she asked, &quot;Is this related to Dr. Wang?&quot; I responded in the affirmative. She then informed me that she was aware of the issues related to Dr. Wang and her office had conducted their own investigation and collected documentation from Dr. Wang&#39;s office. She also stated that she was aware of a &quot;DOJ&quot; (Department of Justice) investigation. She did not elaborate about the DOJ investigation. . .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;That DOJ investigation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/article/u-s-levels-fraud-indictment-cuny-scientist-who-helped-alzheimer-s-drug-developer&quot;&gt;emerged in late June&lt;/a&gt; of this year when Prof. Wang was indicted on charged of defrauding the NIH of approximately $16 million in grant money. The press statement said that he had engaged in &quot;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;a scheme to fabricate and falsify scientific data in grant applications made to the NIH on behalf of himself and (Cassava)&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. For their part, Cassava was quick to note that he had not been involved in the Phase III studies of the drug, although that does rather gloss over how he had been involved in so much more of the company&#39;s history (and simufilam&#39;s) before that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;OK, we have the FDA and the DOJ involved. Yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/article/company-misled-investors-possible-alzheimer-s-drug-sec-charges&quot;&gt;the SEC weighed in&lt;/a&gt; with a $40 million dollar fine for the company and individual fines for two of its former executives. The agency says that the company well knew that Wang&#39;s lab was not qualified to provide the biomarker data used to provide evidence of efficacy in earlier clinical trials, that Wang himself had tested the samples unblinded (which was of course not known to outsiders at the time), and that one of the executives had removed the data from 40% of the trial subjects in a Phase II study after seeing it unblinded. The publicly disclosed results were the impetus to move on to Phase III trials and the impetus to raise another $260 million from various investors. But the numbers appear to have been cooked at every level. It appears that an honest, competent look at the data would have shown that the drug did not work at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;But those Phase III trials are still ongoing, and the question - just as it was last fall, and last summer - is &quot;why&quot;? People have made the case to me that even if there are problems with Cassava&#39;s management that the drug&#39;s effects are interesting enough to pursue. But what if those interesting effects are a mirage? Faked up to raise money? Should we be dosing Alzheimer&#39;s patients with a compound that (at best) we have no confidence in and at worst could be an outright fraud? After all that&#39;s happened, what does it take to stop a trial?&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/cassava-revisited</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/cassava-revisited</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 01:22:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A New Mode of Schizophrenia Treatment</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The FDA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-drug-new-mechanism-action-treatment-schizophrenia&quot;&gt;recently approved&lt;/a&gt; a new drug for schizophrenia treatment, but that statement needs a few qualifiers. The pill is actually a mixture of two drugs (we&#39;ll get to that in a minute) and the main ingredient is not exactly new, having been discovered over thirty years ago. And we&#39;ll get to that right now, after a bit on schizophrenia itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a hard, hard disease to treat. And that&#39;s not least because it&#39;s not a very well-defined one. Like most all the CNS conditions, our lack of knowledge of brain chemistry, neuronal signaling, and the correlates of consciousness make our knowledge rather slippery, at least compared to what we usually think of as a &quot;disease&quot;. I mean, you can take an antigen test and say &quot;Yes, I have been exposed to Covid-19 and I am currently infected&quot;, and you can do imaging, blood chemistry, biopsies and so on with other conditions and say &quot;Yes, that is HER2-positive breast cancer&quot; or &quot;Yes, this is high blood pressure&quot;, or &quot;Yes, this is Grave&#39;s disease&quot; or what have you. Biochemically, we know a fair amount about these things, and we know enough about these mechanisms to be able to suggest several specific treatments for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But schizophrenia, well, we have a lot of competing theories but no clear answer to the question of &quot;What causes it?&quot; Symptoms can vary across a range in different patients (and at different times), and I don&#39;t think it would surprise anyone if eventually we break it down into several different conditions that would in the end need different forms of treatment. For now, we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6180374/&quot;&gt;several drugs&lt;/a&gt;, some of which help some people to some degree for some period of time, and that&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/bmb/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bmb/ldv017&quot;&gt;about all we can offer&lt;/a&gt;. We cannot be sure which of these is the best to start off with, or which may prove most effective in the end (if indeed any): the whole course of treatment is pretty much empirical, because we&#39;re not really sure how any of them work in detail. You try things and see, and if that doesn&#39;t work, you try something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even getting to this point has been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2575138/&quot;&gt;pretty twisty road&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.pn.2021.1.7&quot;&gt;specific mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; have been proposed over the years, but the medications that seem to have the most effect are polypharmacological, hitting several neuron signaling pathways at the same time. And if you think we don&#39;t understand single pathways in the brain, try understand the interplay between two, three, six, or eight of &#39;em simultaneously. It is fair the say that the field needs all the help that it can get, and so do the patients. And that&#39;s why this new approval is noteworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug itself is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanomeline&quot;&gt;xanomeline&lt;/a&gt;, and I know that one well, because I was doing research on Alzheimer&#39;s in the early 1990s. I was on a team trying to make a particular type of selective muscarinic antagonist, and xanomeline came out of work at Lilly and Novo Nordisk to try to make a selective agonist of other muscarinic subtypes. Either of these, the story was, might be able to improve cognitive function in Alzheimer&#39;s (and we weren&#39;t the only companies trying these ideas out). But none of these direct-muscarinic-receptor compounds ever really worked in the disease, and after a few years of futility at the bench, in the animal facilities, and even in the clinic, everyone moved on to other mechanisms that didn&#39;t work, either (such is the way of Alzheimer&#39;s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has to be said that xanomeline did show what appeared to be some positive results in trials, but these were cancelled out by some notably negative ones due to the peripheral side effects. Muscarinic receptors are rather powerful things, and if you go around twanging them you can expect some very noticeable consequences (motion sickness, for example, is large mediated through muscarinic pathways). But since the CNS field still has plenty of room for new drugs, the idea was hatched to revive xanomeline but to give it along with a peripheral muscarnic antagonist: perhaps those two could fight it out to a standstill out in the periphery while the xanomeline does its thing in the brain. There seemed to have been a decrease in hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms with xanomeline before, in addition to all the other side effects, so it seemed to be worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s what the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanomeline/trospium_chloride&quot;&gt;new drug&lt;/a&gt; (Cobenfy) is: the antagonist is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trospium_chloride&quot;&gt;trospium&lt;/a&gt;, which has been on the market for years to treat overactive bladder. Karuna Therapeutics has been working on it for over ten years to get the combination right (under the name KarXT), and Bristol-Myers Squibb &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.bms.com/news/details/2024/Bristol-Myers-Squibb-Completes-Acquisition-of-Karuna-Therapeutics-Strengthening-Neuroscience-Portfolio/default.aspx&quot;&gt;bought Karua outright&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year for about $14 billion (!) once the drug made it through trials successfully. I very much hope that this becomes a useful therapy in the real world - the antischizophrenia drug list has not been meaninfully extended for a long time, and there is a huge amount of what we call unmet medical need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with one part of this drug combo being a compound that was invented decades ago, and the other part being a compound that is even older, the patent situation for the combination is a big part of this story. I will not go into all the details, but Markman Advisors (who know drug patents very well indeed) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.markmanadvisors.com/blog/2024/1/3/will-bristol-myers-patent-gamble-for-karunas-karxt-pay-off&quot;&gt;wrote about this issue&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. There are, as you&#39;d expect, multiple overlapping patents with different expiration dates and claims, and analyzing them is not the work of a moment. But it looks like some key ones could expire around 2030, and even if generics firms file ANDA paperwork early (as they do), in say 2027, it&#39;s still going to be several years before all the litigation dust settles, patent term extension filings are dealt with, and so on. This might be affected by whether the FDA decides xanomeline itself receives &quot;New Chemical Entity&quot; (NCE) exclusivity for five years, and I haven&#39;t seen details on that yet. One the one hand, the drug was invented 30 years ago, but on the other hand it has never been approved by the FDA for any human therapy until now. Suffice it to say, though, that BMS would not have spent all that money acquiring Karuna if they didn&#39;t feel as if they had enough time to make it back. . .&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/new-mode-schizophrenia-treatment</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/new-mode-schizophrenia-treatment</guid><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2024 01:32:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Fraud, So Much Fraud</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Charles Piller and the team here at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/content/article/research-misconduct-finding-neuroscientist-eliezer-masliah-papers-under-suspicion&quot;&gt;dropped a big story&lt;/a&gt; yesterday morning, and if you haven&#39;t read it yet, you should. It&#39;s about &lt;span&gt;Eliezer Masliah, who since 2016 has been the head of the Division of Neuroscience in the National Institute on Aging (NIA), and whose scientific publication record over at least the past 25 years shows &lt;em&gt;multiple, widespread, blatant instances of fraud&lt;/em&gt;. There it is in about as few words as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As is so often the case, image manipulation is at the heart of the scandal. Readers here will be all too familiar with the techniques of cutting and pasting Western blots in order to make them tell the story the authors want told, and of re-using images and parts of images over and over even when they&#39;re supposed to be produced from different experiments at different times. That&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing here, and a 300-page dossier has been assembled with examples of it. Splicing, cloning, overlaying, copy-and-pasting, duplication of the same image with different captions about different research in different journals: a great deal of effort seems to have gone into carefully doctoring, cleaning, beautifying, and spicing up these papers digitally. After looking over examples, I find the evidence convincing and impossible to explain (at least in my mind) as anything other than sustained, deliberate acts of deception lasting for decades. Hundreds of them. Again and again. The dossier references 132 papers with apparent problems. Unfortunately, these include many highly cited papers on mechanisms of synaptic damage (Masliah specialized in Alzheimer&#39;s and Parkinson&#39;s mechanisms, particularly around the alpha-synuclein protein).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The article has a range of reactions to this news from co-workers and others in the field. Everyone seems to have been overwhelmed (as I was) by the scope of the manipulations, and there are plenty of angry and incredulous responses to the news. Along, of course, with some &quot;No comments&quot; and people who refused to reply to emails and would not pick up the phone. Just who knew about these faked-up results over the years is a topic we may never really get to the bottom of: some co-authors have died over the years, and others appear to be running for cover. But at the same time I have a lot of sympathy for the honest scientists who have worked with Masliah over the years and who now have to deal with this explosion of mud over parts of their records.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the article details, this all has some direct drug discovery implications, particularly for an antibody called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasinezumab&quot;&gt;prasinezumab&lt;/a&gt; which targets alpha-synuclein. All four of the fundamental papers about prasinezumab (as cited on the web site of its developer, Prothena) are full of manipulated images, unfortunately. Prothena and Roche &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2202867&quot;&gt;reported results in a Parkinson&#39;s trial&lt;/a&gt; with it in 2022, and the antibody was found to have no benefit at all (it&#39;s undergoing another trial now). Given the difficulty of neurodegeneration therapy, it&#39;s hard to say if that result is an honest failure of a worthwhile idea, or whether the entire effort has been built on data that simply aren&#39;t real. But we cannot rule out the second possibility, at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There&#39;s also a proposed Alzheimer&#39;s therapy called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrolysin&quot;&gt;cerebrolysin&lt;/a&gt;, a peptide mixture derived from porcine brain tissue. An Austrian company (Ever) has run some small inconclusive trials on it in human patients and distributes it to Russia and other countries (it&#39;s not approved in the US or the EU). But the eight Masliah papers that make the case for its therapeutic effects are all full of doctored images, too. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A third drug, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minzasolmin&quot;&gt;minzasolmin&lt;/a&gt;, is supposed to prevent misfolding of alpha-synuclein and Masliah and co-workers published the original papers that make the case for its effects. Papers which have doctored images in them. Masliah co-founded a company (Neuropore) that has been developing the drug, and they have a partnership with Belgian drugmaker UCB. It has to be noted that this one has taken some fire already: a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-023-00552-7&quot;&gt;paper last year&lt;/a&gt; on its in vivo effects brought some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-024-00657-7&quot;&gt;pointed criticism&lt;/a&gt; that the drug&#39;s short half-life should have made it impossible for it to work under the conditions described. The authors &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-024-00658-6&quot;&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt; that they had other evidence of the drug&#39;s mechanism, and I&#39;m glad to hear it, because in addition to the original papers, their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-023-00552-7&quot;&gt;previous paper&lt;/a&gt; on the drug had images in it credited to Masliah that also seem to have been digitally modified. Minzasolmin is currently in Phase II trials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is just a horrible situation in every direction. The NIH has stated that Masliah is no longer heading the Neuroscience division, but they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.z2o7c3k/full/nihmasliahstatement-1727369198683.pdf&quot;&gt;haven&#39;t stated much else&lt;/a&gt;, honestly. An internal investigation starting in May of 2023 led to that decision, apparently but the statement also says that it was in reference to just two publications with duplicated images. It seems like a strange thing to take someone with a long and respected career and subject them to what would essentially be a Western blot and photomicrograph audit before offering them a big position. But if the NIH had done that in 2016, they wouldn&#39;t be in the position they&#39;re in now, would they? How many people do we need to check? How many figures do we have to scrutinize? What a mess.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/fraud-so-much-fraud</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/fraud-so-much-fraud</guid><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 10:55:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>All New Drugs Are Investigational Drugs: A Reminder</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Some years ago, I was part of a team looking at various therapeutic options in the sickle cell disease area. At the time, there was a small biotech company called GBT (Global Blood Therapeutics) that had an unusual approach. As most people know, the underlying cause of sickle cell disease is a mutation in the crucial oxygen-carrying hemoglobin protein, one that makes it more likely to aggregate and polymerize. This process is what bends the erythrocyte cells into the shape characteristic of the disease.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&#39;s only the non-oxygen-carrying molecules of hemoglobin that can form these polymers. GBT had discovered a molecule that increased the affinity of the mutant sickle-cell hemoglobin (HbS) for oxygen, which led to greater function and less polymerization. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6484388/&quot;&gt;mechanism was pretty interesting&lt;/a&gt;: their lead molecule was an aldehyde, a functional group that traditionally we medicinal chemists avoid. That&#39;s because they&#39;re rather reactive - they can pick up water and turn into 1,1-diols (the hydrate form), or air-oxidize into carboxylic acids, or especially react with amines, of which there are a great many in biochemistry. And that&#39;s what the GBT compound was doing: it reacted with the amine group on the N-terminal valine of the hemoglobin alpha chain, and this covalent modification was enough to increase the whole protein&#39;s oxygen-binding ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you&#39;re going to develop a drug with an aldehyde in it as a covalent protein modifier, you&#39;re going to be in for a lot of tests along the way to make sure that you&#39;re not modifying a lot of other stuff. But the GBT compound (now named GBT-440, and later &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxelotor&quot;&gt;voxelotor&lt;/a&gt;), against the odds, made it through test after test for proteomic selectivity, small animal toxicity, and so on. It made it into human trials, where its toxicity profile was still good, and most importantly, it did &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7810265/&quot;&gt;indeed work&lt;/a&gt; to ameliorate sickle cell disease in the clinic, just as had been hoped. The drug was approved by the FDA in 2019, with a further approval for younger patients in 2021. It was approved in the EU in 2022, and it was enough of a success that Pfizer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-acquire-global-blood-therapeutics-54-billion-enhance&quot;&gt;bought the entire company&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 for $5.4 billion, with voxelotor (now brand-named Oxbryta) as the marquee part of the deal. It brought in $328 million last year, and sales were increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, even if you haven&#39;t seen the news, you&#39;ve guessed where this is headed. Last night, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-withdraws-sickle-cell-disease-treatment-all-markets-2024-09-25/&quot;&gt;Pfizer announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was pulling the drug from the market. The European Medicines Agency had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/referral/oxbryta-article-20-procedure-review-started_en.pdf&quot;&gt;announced a review&lt;/a&gt; of the drug back in late July after further clinical studies (one in patients at risk for stroke, another with patients with leg ulcers) had an unexpected number of deaths and adverse events in the treatment groups, and Pfizer&#39;s own review of the data has convinced them to totally pull the drug due to cardiovascular complications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I can see, though, these safety signals did not go off in the clinical trials that led to the drug&#39;s initial approval. I would very much like to know why, and what the adverse event reporting was like on the drug over the past three or four years it&#39;s been on the market. In other words, why are we just seeing this now? Or have we been seeing it but not completely noticing it? There will likely be more on this story in the coming months - at least I hope so. But what seems certain is that the unusual story of an unusual drug has come to a sudden and unexpected end.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/all-new-drugs-are-investigational-drugs-reminder</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/all-new-drugs-are-investigational-drugs-reminder</guid><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 11:55:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Scientific Success and Financial Success, and the Gap Between</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a lesson that&#39;s not very fun to learn: in drug discovery, you can go after ambitious targets, be a pioneer, make your clinical trial endpoints, get FDA approval, launch products that treat patients who have never been treated before. . .and still fail. That looks very much like what&#39;s happening to Bluebird Bio, one of the big forces in modern gene therapy research. Back in 2019 and early 2020, their stock was between $40 and $50 a share, and the latest quote I have is 48 cents. This despite getting three gene therapies on the market! I think that I can guarantee that if you&#39;d told people back in January of 2020 that the company would have three FDA approvals by the end of 2024, they would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have expected this outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s going on? Well, the three gene therapies are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betibeglogene_autotemcel&quot;&gt;Zyntego&lt;/a&gt; (betibeglogene_autotemcel), approved in the US in August of 2022 for some patients with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_thalassemia&quot;&gt;beta-thalassemia&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/action/Elivaldogene%20autotemcel&quot;&gt;Skysona&lt;/a&gt; (elivaldogene autotemcel) in September 2022 for cerebral &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenoleukodystrophy&quot;&gt;adrenoleukodystrophy&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/action/Lovotibeglogene%20autotemcel&quot;&gt;Lyfgenia&lt;/a&gt; (lovotibeglogene autotemcel) in December of 2023 for sickle cell disease. As you can see by the names, these are all autologous stem-cell transplantation based therapies, that involve a full bone marrow transplant followed by reintroduction of gene-altered blood stem cells. Zentego and Lyfgenia both compete with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/action/Exagamglogene%20autotemcel&quot;&gt;Casgevy&lt;/a&gt; (exagamglogene autotemcel) from Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics, which is approved for basically the same patient populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem is, these therapies are expensive (no one ever had any doubt about that), and not very many patients are taking them (which is the nasty surprise). According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/bluebird-bio-lays-25-workforce-gene-therapy-pioneer-struggles-stay-afloat&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, Bluebird said in August that they&#39;re hoping to have 85 patients on one of those three gene therapies by the end of the year, and even doing that means that they&#39;re going to have to put it in gear. They had 27 in mid-August, and as of a couple of days ago they were up to 41, and expecting somewhere around 40 more in the rest of the year. Which makes it sound like even hitting that 85 number won&#39;t be easy, and that itself was the lower end of their previous estimates. As you&#39;d expect given these numbers, the company has never come close to turning a profit, and indeed is over four billion dollars in the red, and counting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are reacting to this situation the way that small biopharmas do: by cutting staff, especially in R&amp;amp;D, in order to focus on commercial operations. About 100 of their 375 employees are in the process of being let go in an attempt to stabilize their cash flow sometime next year. But whether that will work is unknown: the company has had &quot;going concern&quot; language in their SEC filings for some time now, as in substantial doubt about their ability to continue as one, and it looks like these cost-cutting efforts are going to have to work exactly as planned while the number of patient enrollments will have to continue to hit the high side of the estimates. And pretty darn soon, too: it looks like the company has about enough cash to make it into the second quarter of next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is competition with Casgevy the problem? Perhaps only in reducing the number of patients that otherwise would be taking only Bluebird&#39;s therapy. It&#39;s really too soon to say &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/gene-therapies-sickle-cell-disease&quot;&gt;which of the two&lt;/a&gt; is more effective, as far as I can see. Lyfgenia delivers stem cells with a functional gene for regular hemoglobin (i.e., minus the sickle-cell mutations), while Casgevy is delivering cells that have had their ability restored to produce fetal hemoglobin (which normally disappears in adulthood). Both of them should reduce the number of sickled cells and restore normal function, you&#39;d think. And let&#39;s be honest: a full bone-marrow transplant is no walk through the dahlia patch. See, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02994-2&quot;&gt;this woman&lt;/a&gt; who had a stem cell transplant from a compatible donor without sickle cell. She&#39;s free from the disease, but went through a cancer diagnosis due to the transplantation procedure itself (a known risk) and is still experiencing pain due to the years of sickle-cell-induced tissue damage before the transplant. Overall, younger patients (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/health/sickle-cell-gene-therapy-kendric-cromer.html&quot;&gt;like this boy&lt;/a&gt;) are probably a better bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That second link brings up some other factors. I have not seen patient estimates for Casgevy, but a physician at City of Hope in Los Angeles is quoted as having sent cells from one patient to Vertex and is about to send the first to Bluebird. So I don&#39;t think you can expect Casgevy to be wildly more taken up than Zyfgenia. As that article makes clear, the extremely labor- and resource-intensive process of doing the gene-altered transplant means that any given hospital is only going to be able to do a handful of patients a year (and only the well-equipped ones are probably even going to get that far). On the other side, the article says that Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia would end up paying $2.2 million to Vertex for the treatment, versus $3.1 million to Bluebird, so if the two really are equivalent that would seem to be a clear differentiator. (Or it would be in a rational market, anyway, which US health care definitely is not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we have the usual question with such therapies: what are the long-term effects? You&#39;d figure that with a full bone marrow transplant the reset button has truly been pressed for those cells, which would mean a lifetime free of sickle cell disease. But the lifetime effects of going through the transplantation procedure itself, or the more remote chance of something extra going on with the gene-altered blood cells, those will of course have to be watched. All in all, the Cure for Sickle Cell story is not as clearcut as one might have thought. A lot of biomedical stories turn out not to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/scientific-success-and-financial-success-and-gap-between</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/scientific-success-and-financial-success-and-gap-between</guid><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 02:39:49 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
