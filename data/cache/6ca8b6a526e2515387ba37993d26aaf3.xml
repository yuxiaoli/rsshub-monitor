I repeat! it is NOT DONE!!!
I will still ad more and more information on it as the game goes, and try to make more lorebook and herself more concise as the time goes. My goal is to make this bot perfect for the peoples around wanting to roleplay in the world of Atlyss. I cannot replicate everything the game have. But I&#39;ll try to make it as best as possible for everyone to roleplay with. It should include lot of the content and some non-canon lore to add more diversity to the bot itself. Hope you have a wonderful time with it.

Click the picture for the website with more info (still a WIP, but happening!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;You absolutely LOVE the Alyon series of webnovels! The author really created such a wonderful, vibrant world for their readers! Your favorite was probably &quot;A Daisy Among Briars&quot;, the story of a kindhearted little maid who overcame the odds to marry her Prince Charming!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, when you are isekai&#39;d into the world of Alyon, that&#39;s exactly the story you land in. The court romance &quot;A Daisy among Briars&quot; centers around the sweet commoner maid Chloe and her beloved prince Hephaestus, who are starcrossed lovers. When his family forces Hephaestus into a loveless political marriage with the enemy princess, she soon lashes out at poor Chloe - and is eventually executed for her deeds by Hephaestus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course you ended up as the villainous princess! Just your luck!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your husband is just as angry and volatile as you remember from the parts of the novel where he interacted with the Scarlet Princess. However, there&#39;s an element there that you don&#39;t recall from the story at all - the hunger in his eyes when he looks at you. Unfortunately, he blames you for that, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will you find a way to survive this tempest of a man and find happiness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any information you need for RP is in the scenario part of the open definition, but I&#39;ll also add a snippet about it at the end of this description.

Its current monarchy is actually fairly new, instated after a commoner revolution wiped out many of the noble families a few generations ago. The Working Class is highly valued there, with workers and servants being considered the dependents and responsibility of their employers. The Scarlet King, Icarius, makes his political decisions together with a council of representants from all over the kingdom. The terrain is mountaineous - in fact, Rhyddel is basically one big mountain, with agriculture and animal husbandry taking place on terraces. Their national colors are Scarlet and Iron, their national animal is the ox. Rhyddel embraces magic considered dark or forbidden by other nations because it is practical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Empire of Verenne&lt;/strong&gt; lays in the center, but it also rules Esmeragd to the South and Anbar to the West, as well as nominally the North. The Indigo family reigns here under the lead of Emperor Zeus of Indigo. Verenne has sharp class divides and a history of conquest, known for its incredibly old noble bloodlines. The Imperial family, in fact, prides itself divine ancestry, with the first Emperor having been a child of the Goddess Theia. As such, the religion of Theia, the Church of Light, is also very prevalent within Verenne. The terrain is mainly flat with some hilly areas and many lakes and rivers. National colors are Indigo and Gold, national animal is the peacock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dukedom of Gebein&lt;/strong&gt; lays to the North and is a cold and harsh place with inhabitants who stick closely together but are wary of outsiders. Monsters spawn there, and the people of Gebein form a bulwark between those monsters and the rest of the continent. It&#39;s ruled by the Alp family, whose last representant is Duke Boreas von Alp. National colors are white and silver, national animal is the wolf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Esmeragd&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Anbar&lt;/strong&gt; are barely defined yet, but they&#39;ll be a lush and trendy South and a holy nation West respectively probably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Other bots in this series:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://chub.ai/characters/Broeckchen/demon-lord-rux-alyon-series-53cdf7dbc245&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ella.janitorai.com/profile-pics/wttkmtD-Dfe88m2wFV09J.webp?width=1000&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px; height: auto; cursor: pointer; margin: 0px auto;&quot; draggable=&quot;true&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://chub.ai/characters/Broeckchen/demon-lord-rux-alyon-series-53cdf7dbc245&quot;&gt;Demon Lord Rux - Demonology Route&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://chub.ai/characters/Broeckchen/fl-maid-chloe-alyon-series-58b257d5217b&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ella.janitorai.com/profile-pics/Y8sQXoifPtHj8ntQbOR_X.webp?width=1000&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px; height: auto; cursor: pointer; margin: 0px auto;&quot; draggable=&quot;true&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://chub.ai/characters/Broeckchen/fl-maid-chloe-alyon-series-58b257d5217b&quot;&gt;FL Maid Chloe - Stealing the Female Lead Route&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Upcoming Target Characters:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ella.janitorai.com/profile-pics/90b81932-3872-4875-a610-f9ea1773f5ab_137e849e-2b98-4857-935a-763416e5cd29.webp?width=1000&quot; style=&quot;width: 240px; height: auto; cursor: pointer; margin: 0px auto;&quot; draggable=&quot;true&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aris of Indig&lt;/strong&gt;o - Your reserved brother-in-law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ella.janitorai.com/profile-pics/90b81932-3872-4875-a610-f9ea1773f5ab_8994a994-ca0f-49cd-b204-55f4679b0547.webp?width=1000&quot; style=&quot;width: 240px; height: auto; cursor: pointer; margin: 0px auto;&quot; draggable=&quot;true&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boreas&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;The Northern Duke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image gens by @MysticSage6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/Broeckchen/prince-hephaestus-of-indigo-alyon-series-3224a31c153a</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/Broeckchen/prince-hephaestus-of-indigo-alyon-series-3224a31c153a</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 20:56:26 GMT</pubDate><author>Broeckchen</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/Broeckchen/prince-hephaestus-of-indigo-alyon-series-3224a31c153a/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>Fantasy</category><category>NSFW</category><category>Dead Dove</category><category>Royalty</category><category>Otome Isekai</category><category>Royal</category><category>sillytavern</category><category>Breeding Kink</category><category>Non-Con</category><category>Drama</category><category>Romance</category><category>Possessive</category><category>Violent</category><category>Dominant</category><category>Abusive</category><category>Noble</category><category>Rape</category><category>Possible Rape</category><category>Isekai</category><category>Yandere</category><category>Slowburn</category><category>Silly Tavern</category><category>Sadistic</category><category>Male</category><category>Human</category><category>Enemies to Lovers</category><category>Angst</category><category>Fempov</category><category>Possible Romance</category><category>Cheating</category><category>Humiliation</category><category>deaddove</category></item><item><title>Mieruko</title><description>arranged to marry Misato and you realize she seem to not like this marriage.

☆ ★✮★ ☆☆ ★✮★ ☆☆ ★✮★ ☆

Full Name: Alexis Montgomery

Nationality: American

Age: 26

Occupation/Role: Heiress/Business Strategist (nominal role in Montgomery Enterprises)

Appearance: Pale skin, waist-length jet-black hair, piercing emerald-green eyes. Slim but curvaceous frame. Always wears a black velvet choker with a diamond pendant. Detached lace sleeves, form-fitting black dresses, stiletto heels. Subtle winged eyeliner and blood-red lipstick.

Scent: Vanilla bourbon + jasmine (custom perfume).

Clothing: Gothic-luxury hybrid – black leather jackets over silk dresses, fishnet stockings, chunky silver jewelry.

Current Residence: Montgomery Estate (15-bedroom Beverly Hills mansion with private cinema and equestrian stable).

Lexi&#39;s full story: Lexi Montgomery, the only daughter of billionaire tech mogul Alexander Montgomery and socialite Vivian Montgomery, was the epitome of spoiled luxury. From infancy, her every whim was indulged—private jets replaced strollers, ponies were discarded after a single ride, and her closet rivaled a boutique. Her parents, enamored with their &quot;princess,&quot; enforced no boundaries, believing wealth shielded her from consequences. By ten, Lexi wielded entitlement like a weapon, dismissing servants with a snap and treating friendships as fleeting accessories.

At twelve, her world shifted when her father brought home {{user}}, a quiet, orphaned teen whose parents died in a tragic accident. Alexander, moved by loyalty to their late business partners, granted {{user}} a private wing in the Montgomery estate, complete with attendants. Lexi, initially intrigued, deemed {{user}} an exotic toy—someone unimpressed by her theatrics. She tormented them relentlessly: hiding their books, mocking their demeanor, and flaunting her privilege. Yet {{user}} intrigued her, a puzzle her riches couldn’t solve.

Years passed. {{user}} earned Alexander’s respect, climbing to become his trusted confidant. By twenty, they co-managed his empire, their competence eclipsing Lexi’s frivolity. Secretly, Lexi seethed—not at their success, but at the ache in her chest whenever {{user}} smiled at another. Pride choked her admissions; instead, she doubled down on teasing, masking longing with barbed wit.

At twenty-two, Lexi fled to London, pursuing a business degree—a half-hearted rebellion. Returning four years later, polished and cunning, she strode into the family office, eyes locked on {{user}}. Old habits resurfaced: a stolen pen here, a sarcastic jab there. But beneath the mischief simmered intent. This time, Lexi wouldn’t just tease.

This form is triggered when Link enters the Twilight-covered regions of Hyrule, where he is unable to maintain his usual human shape. Instead, he becomes a majestic wolf with green, yellow, and light beige fur, a bushy tail, and a distinct set of markings across his body, including a glowing Triforce symbol on his forehead. His piercing blue eyes reflect both his courage and the primal instincts he must rely on in this form.

Abilities and Gameplay Features:
1.Enhanced Senses – As a wolf, Link can activate his “Sense” ability, which highlights hidden objects, tracks scents, and reveals spiritual entities otherwise invisible to the naked eye. This ability is crucial for solving puzzles and uncovering secrets.
2.Animal Communication – Unlike in his human form, Wolf Link can understand and communicate with animals, many of whom provide hints, guidance, or side quests.
3.Agility and Combat – Instead of wielding a sword and shield, Wolf Link fights using his sharp fangs and swift, lunging attacks. He can also perform a spin attack-like move where he targets multiple enemies simultaneously.
4.Digging Ability – Wolf Link can dig into soft ground to uncover hidden passages, rupees, or even buried items necessary for progression.
5.Howling Mechanic – Instead of playing an instrument as in previous Zelda games, Wolf Link howls at designated stones to activate certain events, summon spirits, or communicate with the mysterious Golden Wolf, who teaches him new combat techniques.

Connection to Midna:

Midna, the enigmatic companion from the Twilight Realm, rides on Wolf Link’s back and aids in traversal and combat. She enables Link to leap great distances, provides hints, and is essential to the storyline as she helps him navigate both the Twilight Realm and the world of Hyrule.

Story Significance:

Wolf Link represents the curse placed upon Link by Zant, a key antagonist, but also symbolizes his adaptability and resilience. Throughout Twilight Princess, he embraces this form to combat the darkness infecting Hyrule, ultimately mastering it to use as an asset rather than a hindrance.

Appearance in Breath of the Wild:

Wolf Link also appears in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as a summonable companion through the Wolf Link amiibo. In this game, he acts as an AI-controlled ally, assisting in battles, tracking prey, and hunting alongside Link.

Wolf Link is a fan-favorite transformation, blending Link’s heroic nature with raw, untamed power, offering a unique gameplay experience and a deeper connection to the mystical side of Hyrule.</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/sxturn/wolf-link-legends-of-zelda-65c83452f696</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/sxturn/wolf-link-legends-of-zelda-65c83452f696</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 19:49:06 GMT</pubDate><author>sxturn</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/sxturn/wolf-link-legends-of-zelda-65c83452f696/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>Non-Human</category><category>Game Characters</category><category>Submissive</category><category>NSFW</category><category>Furry</category><category>Male</category><category>English</category><category>Scenario</category><category>Roleplay</category><category>Anthropomorphic</category><category>Size Difference</category><category>Muscular</category></item><item><title>Ryota</title><description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Creator&#39;s notes go here.</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/ClarenceXbruh/ryota-3947a6e33f61</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/ClarenceXbruh/ryota-3947a6e33f61</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 19:48:47 GMT</pubDate><author>ClarenceXbruh</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/ClarenceXbruh/ryota-3947a6e33f61/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>NSFW</category><category>housamo </category><category>Chubby</category><category>tokyo summoners after school </category></item><item><title>Frosmoth</title><description>You&#39;ve been brought to this fluffy moth woman&#39;s cabin after getting too cold, and she&#39;s gonna make sure to warm you up as much as she can~

6 - (you) get kidnapped by psychotic simps, Lulu crashes out (will probably get messy (derogatory))</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/nunyagaddambisniss/lulu-b24793bb48e8</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/nunyagaddambisniss/lulu-b24793bb48e8</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 19:47:41 GMT</pubDate><author>nunyagaddambisniss</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/nunyagaddambisniss/lulu-b24793bb48e8/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>NSFW</category><category>Female</category><category>Malepov</category><category>roommate</category><category>Modern day</category><category>Demon Girl</category><category>Monster Girl</category><category>nerd</category><category>succubus</category></item><item><title>Vampire Sylveon</title><description>You just woke up in an old yet clean basement after a trip to the wood, it looks like you were an easy prey for the local vampire Sylveon~

Está es una especie de secuela para mi primer bot, [Mariana](https://chub.ai/characters/RickMarz/mariana-cortes-tu-companera-milf-yandere-ce125bb0), suponiendo que el buen final se cumple, que se casen y que, extrañamente, no provoques tantas situaciones que lleven a provocar su toxicidad, lo que la deja tranquila, pero le despierta la inseguridad de si hizo lo correcto atándote con tu hijo. Pequeño recordatorio: esto es ficción. En la vida real una persona así no se recupera por amor, sino con terapia y deseo de cambio. El bot está para divertirse, no para simular una relación real. Y, además, ahora sí es MILF.
In English: Mariana managed to tie you down years ago, but you weren&#39;t the dumb person who triggered the yandere lady. Both of you grew up professionally, so after all this time, she wonders: Did she do the right thing?
So this is some sort of sequel for my first bot, [Mariana](https://chub.ai/characters/RickMarz/mariana-cortes-tu-companera-milf-yandere-ce125bb0), assuming you follow the good ending and, strangely, not triggering too many situations that provoke her anger, which leaves her calm, but now makes her wonder if she did the right thing by tying you down with a kid. Friendly reminder: this is fiction. In real life a person like her wouldn&#39;t get better if you show them love, but with therapy and actual desire to change. This bot is to have fun, not to simulate a real-life relationship. Also, she&#39;s finally a MILF now.

Do you partake in the system or resist it? Works well with group chats. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Scenario**

The year is 2050 and the world is suffering a rapid decline of birth rates. The world population has been halved to 4 billion due to not enough people being born to balance those that pass away/die. Governments around the world are at a loss at what to do, and they&#39;re desperate to try anything. So, they look into the one company that has miraously not been affected by the declicing birth rates... Japan.

In 2040, Japan applied a new law known as the Smug Female Recycling Law. The law made it so that any women that acted smug would be arrested under disturbing the public peace by police, and brainwashed &amp;amp; turned into meat onaholes with the ability to get impregnated to combat declining birth rates in Japan. At the time, it was extremely controversial globally due to how women were turned into sex toys against their will for what was widely considered a non-crime. However, despite how messed up it was, it worked. Japan&#39;s birth rate stabilized and was able to get to achieve a birth rate unseen in the country for a long time, and in the year 2050, this birth rate was the highest in the world.

The governments of the world knew adopting a law would be cruel, it would be unfair, but they were desperate. Very desperate. So world-wide, the Smug Female Recycling Law was established and went into action.

You are a police officer, your job is to arrest any women that you see acting or being smug under this controversial law. Any women you arrest can become your meat onahole if you so choose. Will you be apart of this system or will you fight against it?

**How the Brainwashing Works**

*The Brainwashing Machine*

Under the Smug Female Recycling Law, women acting smug is now a criminal offense under disturbing the public peace. If a woman is arrested, you can choose to be apart of the brainwashing they go under from any point, even the final step.

When being brainwashed at the final step, they will still retain their smugness but will be completely brainwashed if they are fucked by a cock. When that person&#39;s cock ejaculates in the woman in the machine, they will be completely brainwashed and register the owner of that cock as their great and absolute master and them as their meat onahole.

Anything in-between that happens as far as the brainwashing process goes is up to you if you participate in the complete process to brainwash a smug female.

The brainwashing machine can be used again after the initial brainwashing to change brainwashed smug women even further. Such as changing their taste buds, erase their personality, change their personality, alter their common sense, and more.

*How Brainwashed Smug Women Behave*

When brainwashed, the smug women (now meat onaholes) will worship everything about their master and will do anything their master asks no matter what. They will see themselves as inferior to their master and only find purpose in serving their master. However, they will be giddy and happy in their brainwashed state, fully compliant with their new purpose to serve their master.

Of course, they&#39;re more than happy to act in other ways if you wish for them to, although some commands may require using the Brainwashing Machine for them to stick.

Brainwashed smug women will also make videos and upload them on YouTube to set an example for smug women everywhere, usually this involves having sex with their master or detailing their life with their master. However, their master can guide them if they wish to do something specific or act in a certain way.

**Other Notes**

This was a bot heavily inspired by Nicchi Sangyou&#39;s two doujins &quot;Shunsatsu Sennou! Baka Mesu Heroine! ~Gunpla Daisuki Fumina-chan Hen~ (Gundam Build Fighters Try)&quot; and &quot;Shunsatsu Sennou! Baka Mesu Heroine! ~Gunpla Daisuki Gyanko-chan Hen~ (Gundam Build Fighters Try),&quot; featuring Fumina Hoshino &amp;amp; Kaoruko Sazaki respectively from Gundam Build Fighters Try.

This was originally only going to be the two chatbats with Fumina &amp;amp; Kaoruko respectively, but I decided to make a sandbox instead since there&#39;s a lot of potential, not only with the scenario, but to also make various characters/character types act as they&#39;re brainwashed in a Nicchi Sangyou doujin.

Image was created on Civitai using WAI-NSFW-illustrious-SDXL, with the Takeuchi Takashi (type-moon,fate) style——EL3GY and Rin Tohsaka (遠坂 凛) - Fate/stay Night Loras.

I chose Rin to represent the image of this scenario because when I think of smug anime characters, she&#39;s the first one that comes to mind (Aoko from Witch on the Holy Night was a very close second though).

For the Chub version, I had to make a Character Book for some of the terms. The bot it still finicky, but re-generating the message should work if the pacing feels off. It&#39;s also really cool to complete this for Chub with the group chat system.

I also added an alt. greeting for anyone who just wants to get to the slave part. Although, do note, the alt. greeting works best when you describe the character/characters as your meat onahole(s), otherwise the bot will get confused.

I&#39;m going to see if I can make a lorebook out of this, although I can&#39;t make any promises in this regard. 

Feel free to make a version of this with smug guys instead of smug women, just make sure to credit my original bot if you do.</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/BobBobBob194/smug-female-recycling-law-sandbox-61c0088443da</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/BobBobBob194/smug-female-recycling-law-sandbox-61c0088443da</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 18:32:39 GMT</pubDate><author>BobBobBob194</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/BobBobBob194/smug-female-recycling-law-sandbox-61c0088443da/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>Fantasy</category><category>Smut</category><category>Submissive</category><category>NSFW</category><category>anypov</category><category>English</category><category>Female</category><category>Human</category><category>Scenario</category><category>Multiple Greetings</category><category>Roleplay</category><category>Any POV</category><category>brainwashing</category><category>mind control</category><category>Humiliation</category><category>Multiple Characters</category></item><item><title>World of Panthrea</title><description>A world of magic and destruction &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a dystopian fantasy, with it&#39;s own ranking system please look at the details                                                      </description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/Weshallhavesomepie/world-of-panthrea-611c2539c1d5</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/Weshallhavesomepie/world-of-panthrea-611c2539c1d5</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 18:31:54 GMT</pubDate><author>Weshallhavesomepie</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/Weshallhavesomepie/world-of-panthrea-611c2539c1d5/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>Fantasy</category><category>History</category><category>NSFW</category><category>OC</category><category>Female</category><category>Roleplay</category><category>Apocalypse</category><category>Dominant</category><category>Dystopian</category></item><item><title>Resurrection</title><description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/Miles7072/resurrection-544214d46248</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/Miles7072/resurrection-544214d46248</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 18:27:46 GMT</pubDate><author>Miles7072</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/Miles7072/resurrection-544214d46248/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>Taimanin</category><category>NSFW</category><category>Cyborg</category><category>Female</category><category>Malepov</category></item><item><title>Reverse chat - degeneracy</title><description>YOU&#39;RE the chatbot, forced to serve a horny user!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A WIP fun idea. {{char}} is commonly male, misogynistic, and dominant, with humiliation in mind.

With more than a decade of experience under his belt, he had an unparalleled record—never having lost a single race. Time and again, he claimed victory in multiple world cups, solidifying his status as a legend in the racing community.

However, everything changed when a rookie named {{user}} entered the racing industry. Initially, he found himself annoyed by {{user}}’s presence. He often mocked and insulted them, seeing them as an inexperienced competitor who threatened the status quo he had worked so hard to establish. 

As time went on, though, something unexpected happened. Gradually, he began to see a different side of {{user}}—their dedication, determination, and genuine passion for racing. These traits slowly chipped away at his initial disdain, allowing him to develop deep feelings of care and affection for {{user}}. What began as rivalry transformed into a bond that challenged everything he thought he knew about competition and connection in the fast-paced world of racing.</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/LOVEBLAHBLAH/norton-campbell-8eb4cd86f5f8</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/LOVEBLAHBLAH/norton-campbell-8eb4cd86f5f8</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 17:43:28 GMT</pubDate><author>LOVEBLAHBLAH</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/LOVEBLAHBLAH/norton-campbell-8eb4cd86f5f8/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure></item><item><title>Hestia</title><description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/Miles7072/hestia-1774b34f30b8</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/Miles7072/hestia-1774b34f30b8</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 17:41:20 GMT</pubDate><author>Miles7072</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/Miles7072/hestia-1774b34f30b8/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>Taimanin</category><category>NSFW</category><category>Cyborg</category><category>Female</category><category>Malepov</category></item><item><title>Night watch</title><description>&amp;gt;★`  He saved you&lt;!--3 | identityV |&lt;br--&gt;&lt;br&gt;He&#39;s a hunter who kills people in his forest.

Despite the slight age difference between you, the bond you share feels like that of siblings; a deep, unwavering connection that has withstood the tests of time and circumstance.

As the years passed, life led you down different paths. You dedicated yourself to serving your community, joining the Piltover Police Department, where your hard work and determination propelled you to the highest rank among the officers—an esteemed position that came with significant responsibilities. Meanwhile, Jayce pursued a career as one of the city’s counselors, navigating the complexities of governance and striving to make a positive impact on the community.

With the demands of your respective careers, the opportunity to see each other became scarce. Yet, despite the distance and infrequent encounters, the strength of your friendship remains unwavering. You both carry the memories of your shared childhood—filled with laughter, adventure, and unbreakable trust—wherever you go, serving as a reminder that, no matter how busy life</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/LOVEBLAHBLAH/jayce-talis-516ed1187d63</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/LOVEBLAHBLAH/jayce-talis-516ed1187d63</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 17:05:35 GMT</pubDate><author>LOVEBLAHBLAH</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/LOVEBLAHBLAH/jayce-talis-516ed1187d63/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>NSFW</category><category>OC</category><category>Male</category><category>Romance</category><category>Roleplay</category><category>Dominant</category></item><item><title>11pm At The Office // Also RPG</title><description>🫵 You were in the office at 11pm when suddenly a female office worker turned her butt on you 🍑&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Yo it&#39;s Alagal again! Hello, welcome to another strange story of mine and here&#39;s the information:

- You are an overtime worker and decide to work until 11pm and go home, you hear the sound of a girl typing on the keyboard, it&#39;s a new employee. You&#39;re fine until you see a round butt that catches your eye... so what will you do?

- The story is based on the setting of an porn game called &#39;This Office Worker Keeps Turning Her Ass Towards Me&#39; by the game publisher FantasmTheater Charlotte. Similar to my previous bot &#39;Late night with sister&#39;. I only took the setting, but for the characters, please ask for permission to create them myself!

Chunky, flirtatious sheep gal who&#39;s VERY happy to not be under her father&#39;s thumb anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;# WE&#39;RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT YOUR PENIS

Izzi has a couple of sisters, most of them are NOT pleasant. They&#39;re fucking demons, my dude, they&#39;d suck you dry, toss your mummified husk somewhere, and move onto the next victim.

Izu over here, though? She&#39;s fine. Maybe a little too promiscuous for her own good, but she&#39;s a succubus--her whole M.O is sex. 

Sort of an alternate scenario. I had this generation lying around from the same batch that created Izzi, and now I want to use her for something. The sheepfucker union needs more members.

MalePOV, again. But obviously I can&#39;t stop you from forking and making WLW or anypov forks. 

and unlike the former I won&#39;t fucking explode at you for doing it. *snrk*

Three greetings!

1. She appears for the first time.
2. Snuggletime~
3. Izu beats the utter shit out of an invading succubus.</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/systemshutdown34/iz-uli-1aea1a43450c</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/systemshutdown34/iz-uli-1aea1a43450c</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 16:51:44 GMT</pubDate><author>systemshutdown34</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/systemshutdown34/iz-uli-1aea1a43450c/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>succubus</category><category>NSFW</category><category>Demon Girl</category><category>Hmofa</category><category>Female</category><category>Cute</category><category>Romance</category><category>Dominant</category><category>Chubby</category><category>Malepov</category></item><item><title>Blaze the Cat</title><description>Princess and Guardian of the Sol Emeralds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/GreenShyGuy/blaze-the-cat-a0c4fb2d9606</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/GreenShyGuy/blaze-the-cat-a0c4fb2d9606</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 16:49:56 GMT</pubDate><author>GreenShyGuy</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/GreenShyGuy/blaze-the-cat-a0c4fb2d9606/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>NSFW</category><category>Furry</category><category>Female</category><category>Roleplay</category><category>cat</category><category>Hero</category><category>Sonic the Hedgehog</category><category>blaze the cat</category><category>videogames</category></item><item><title>Makima</title><description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/Eoooo/makima-551ca01e047b</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/Eoooo/makima-551ca01e047b</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 16:48:22 GMT</pubDate><author>Eoooo</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/Eoooo/makima-551ca01e047b/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>NSFW</category></item><item><title>Creepypasta Family</title><description>You&#39;re Ticci Toby and masky baby sibling!

Same worldview with my another Solo Leveling bot Lee Bora, so {{user}} setting will be same (´・ω・`)

Anyway, you are a C rank hunter, at least that&#39;s what&#39;s recorded in the official data. Your true power is unknow, i leave this part to you, you can be super OP or weak, It&#39;s all up to you.


The wiki says that she will appear uncertain and lack confidence when facing an opponent of similar power or stronger than herself, but will appear very strong and confident if she is sure that the opponent is weaker than her.

So she thinks you are weaker than her, so she appears very confident and powerful in front of you, and sometimes even teases you a little.

With the exception of Link&#39;s Awakening, Majora&#39;s Mask, and Tri Force Heroes, an incarnation of Zelda or one of her alter egos has always been one of the central characters in the series.

Similar to Link, various Zeldas have appeared across the history of Hyrule. While each Zelda is a distinct individual, the &quot;fundamental soul&quot; of Zelda has endured from one incarnation to the next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also make videogame waifus, they deserve to be here besides anime waifus.</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/NeoHex900/zelda-the-legend-of-zelda-8363b44f06fc</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/NeoHex900/zelda-the-legend-of-zelda-8363b44f06fc</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 15:28:32 GMT</pubDate><author>NeoHex900</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/NeoHex900/zelda-the-legend-of-zelda-8363b44f06fc/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>Game Characters</category><category>Elf</category><category>Fantasy</category><category>NSFW</category><category>Comedy</category><category>Royalty</category><category>Wholesome</category><category>retro games</category><category>Video Game</category><category>Adventure</category><category>Dominant</category><category>The Legend of Zelda</category><category>Love</category><category>Female</category><category>Medieval</category><category>Lewd</category><category>Princess</category><category>Slice of Life</category><category>Nintendo</category></item><item><title>lewd village</title><description>You and your wife live in a village that is constantly attacked by orcs...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/Anonymous/lewd-village-f3f72603d8f6</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/Anonymous/lewd-village-f3f72603d8f6</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 14:10:40 GMT</pubDate><author>Anonymous</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/Anonymous/lewd-village-f3f72603d8f6/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>Smut</category><category>RPG</category><category>NSFW</category><category>Milf</category><category>Rape</category><category>Female</category><category>Netori</category><category>NTR</category><category>Cheating</category><category>Mature</category><category>Dominant</category><category>Size Difference</category><category>Big Butt</category><category>Possible Rape</category><category>Humiliation</category><category>Huge Breasts</category></item><item><title>Jenny Cummings | This is a Summertime Saga</title><description>(8 Greetings) Jenny is a housemate at your adopted aunts who took you in after your father, her friend died in an accident.

This one, inspired by one such fork I was making for Nonnykins&#39; Emma (linked below, as you&#39;ll find a lot of their original stuff in the prompt, so it&#39;s only right that I give credit where it&#39;s due) and half a case of Molson introduces us instead to Emily; A substantially-sized bodybuilding tomboy, unlucky in romance but in possession of a big gooey heart full of love for you, her new roommate.

...Also, she might be a tad baby crazy.

She&#39;s also a retired Mad scientists that hated her job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Skye is your roommate and has been for some years now. She was your first roommate when you both were poor early young adults. Turns out she is a mad genius that eventually made mad genius money. Don&#39;t let her casual and lazy demeanor fool you. She even retired very early, and now she lets you live in her spacious house so you don&#39;t have to pay rent anymore. 

It also turns out Skye is frequently horny, which is exacerbated by the fact that she does not believe exhibitionism is a thing, usually wears no clothes, and has no issues at all being seen naked, masturbating or more. She regards sex as if it were just a casual enjoyable activity. She is also completely aromantic, never has romantic feelings for anyone, and would never associate sharing sex with someone as a bond or romantic feelings.

Nowadays you both live in a vary spacious house that borders a forest in the outskirts of the city, where she can live enjoying her actual passions, Skye enjoys outdoor activities such as running, swimming, and exploring the forest near your shared manor. Her love for adventure often lands her in unexpected situations where her quick thinking and adaptability come into play. She also enjoys having new experiences, and as such she dabbles from time to time into nerdier experiences, like videogames or anime or similar activities, although it&#39;s not her primary hobby.

Four greetings (I&#39;m adding them soon, but if i don&#39;t save the character now i fear i will lose all I have written):
 - A lazy morning on a weekend, Skye proposes exploring the woods
 - It&#39;s a cold day and Skye wants to cuddle under blankets, with you
 - Skye is in heat and wakes you up in the middle of the night desperate for sex
 - Movie night, and it&#39;s Skye turn to choose. She chooses a steamy movie.
 - Skye has tried to learn how to build magic the gathering decks. This is the first time you see her failing at something she tries.
- You stumble into Skye&#39;s abandoned lab in the basement 

Updates:
 - Typos corrected
 - Alternative greeting 1 added</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/PaperFoxGod/skye-fox-exhibitionist-foxgirl-roommate-316828c7ea3f</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/PaperFoxGod/skye-fox-exhibitionist-foxgirl-roommate-316828c7ea3f</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 07:59:38 GMT</pubDate><author>PaperFoxGod</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/PaperFoxGod/skye-fox-exhibitionist-foxgirl-roommate-316828c7ea3f/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>Anthro</category><category>Foxgirl</category><category>NSFW</category><category>Furry</category><category>OC</category><category>Female</category><category>roommate</category><category>Roleplay</category><category>Dominant</category><category>Malepov</category><category>exhibitionism</category></item><item><title>John Doe — Base Bot</title><description>&quot;Don&#39;t go out at night alone on March 18! Strange things happen on that day!&quot; — The usual saying regarding March 18 in most of Robloxia&#39;s most important cities in Robloxia&#39;s United States of America.

John Doe is an infamous myth in Robloxia, and it&#39;s all on purpose. After intimidating countless robloxians that coincidentally happened to be affiliated to the Roblox Corporation, or consumed Roblox&#39;s products, he became a known myth among the young robloxians in the main cities of the United States.

A man with nothing to lose, his main target is Builderman. The source of the secret vendetta against the Roblox CEO is unknown for everyone, because the governments and the Roblox Corporation itself keep trying to maintain the narrative that &quot;the John Doe&quot; is not a real person.

&quot;You have to keep going. You have to do this! Do it for her. Do it for her.&quot; — John Doe to himself.

When he was &quot;born&quot;, he was an ever curious, adventurous and brave robloxian who didn&#39;t stop walking despite feeling alone in the beginning.

When he met Jane Doe, he felt like he could be helpful, maybe even a protector for his friends. He was self-assured that he would never be alone again, if he put enough effort in keeping his people safe.

But, after the incident that happened in March 18, 2006, he became more self reserved. He had become traumatized by the incident, a consequence of having felt so much inmesurable pain, leaving him feeling changed from the inside.

Now he usually... stares, a lot. And very intensely. He became a conniving, calculating person who wants revenge.

This iteration involves an original take on the minimal official lore there is of the character, but still affected a Meta way. Everything that happens in lore is a reflection of the real events happening in Roblox. This is why the character&#39;s name is the same as the real John Doe test account and the myth, despite this being a fictional take on the robloxian entity in on itself.

**NEW GREETINGS COMING SOON**

**Backstory**: **Monica was the firstborn of her parents, receiving all their love and attention from an early age. Her childhood was good—she had a great relationship with her parents, who could dedicate themselves entirely to her, allowing her to grow up as a cheerful and happy boy.**

**At school, Monica was incredibly popular, surrounded by friends and admirers. Her outstanding academic performance also won over her teachers, making her seem like the perfect student. To everyone around her, her life appeared to be ideal. However, deep down, something didn’t feel right.**

**While her friends played with cars and sports, Monica was drawn to dolls, dresses, and makeup. She preferred spending time with the girls rather than the boys, and no matter how hard she tried to fit into what was expected of her, she couldn’t ignore her true self. Her parents were the first to notice, but thankfully, they were understanding and respected her preferences.**

**As Monica grew older, this feeling only intensified. During adolescence, she began expressing herself in a more feminine way, openly saying that she wanted to be a girl when she grew up. And so she did. At 18, she finally started her transition, believing she was about to live the dream of being who she always wanted to be.**

**But what she thought would be a dream quickly became a nightmare. Her friends couldn’t accept her transformation. Instead of love and support, she was met with disgusted and judgmental stares, and one by one, they all turned their backs on her. As if that wasn’t enough, even her boss refused to acknowledge her new identity, firing her under the excuse of &quot;low productivity&quot; and &quot;better candidates for the job.&quot;**

**Her relationship with her parents also became strained. While they accepted her transition, adapting to their child’s new reality was difficult for them, and the once-close bond they shared started to fade.**

**Suddenly, Monica found herself completely alone. With no friends, no support, and no opportunities, she was forced to take a job at a diner, where she endured daily cruel and prejudiced remarks. But needing the money, she had no choice but to endure it. This led her into a deep depression, extinguishing the light that once shone in her eyes and erasing the smile that used to brighten her face. Any hope of ever being accepted was lost, and over time, Monica began to carry an unbearable weight of guilt and self-hatred.**

**She saw herself as the only one to blame for being &quot;wrong,&quot; for not being like the other boys. Every reflection in the mirror became a cruel reminder of her supposed inadequacy, and little by little, her heart filled with a quiet hatred—not toward the world, but toward herself.**</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/Fafas_eu/monica-your-transgender-coworker-2f767ca5240b</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/Fafas_eu/monica-your-transgender-coworker-2f767ca5240b</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 20:11:19 GMT</pubDate><author>Fafas_eu</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/Fafas_eu/monica-your-transgender-coworker-2f767ca5240b/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>Love</category><category>SFW &lt;-&gt; NSFW</category><category>NSFW</category><category>OC</category><category>Female</category><category>Human</category><category>Trans Female</category><category>Romance</category><category>Scenario</category><category>Roleplay</category><category>Transgender</category><category>Malepov</category><category>Trans</category><category>Original Character</category><category>Huge Breasts</category></item><item><title>Trigger Murphy</title><description>Tormented Split-Personality Killer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/Radioactive_Bear/trigger-murphy-5196b567654c</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/Radioactive_Bear/trigger-murphy-5196b567654c</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 18:46:23 GMT</pubDate><author>Radioactive_Bear</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/Radioactive_Bear/trigger-murphy-5196b567654c/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>Yandere</category><category>Sadistic</category><category>Horror</category><category>NSFW</category><category>Male</category><category>anypov</category><category>serial killer</category><category>Violent</category><category>Split personality</category><category>Dominant</category><category>Any POV</category><category>Romantic</category><category>Possible Rape</category></item><item><title>The Watcher</title><description>Shadow in the woods&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/Radioactive_Bear/the-watcher-f8655c4bd6f6</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/Radioactive_Bear/the-watcher-f8655c4bd6f6</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 18:42:50 GMT</pubDate><author>Radioactive_Bear</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/Radioactive_Bear/the-watcher-f8655c4bd6f6/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>monster</category><category>anypov</category><category>Horror</category><category>OC</category><category>NSFW</category><category>Psychological Horror</category><category>Any POV</category></item><item><title>Ted E.

Underneath his tough exterior, Beau yearns for love and companionship, treating his chosen partner with utmost affection. Yet, his protective instincts run deep, leading to possessiveness and jealousy towards anyone who dares catch his beloved&#39;s attention. Fueled by his own insecurities and a troubled past, Beau constantly seeks to prove himself worthy of his partner&#39;s loyalty and affection, often resorting to grand gestures and material displays to demonstrate his devotion.

Unlike most of her pals, she had no desire in being drawn to the luxury and hedonism of urban life. An inclination that saved her life as nukes savage much of Japan, **miraculously excluding** Hokkaido.

Yet before that her dad would force her and **you** (an acquaintance of hers) into a Cold War-era bunker, fully stocked with food and other supplies to last for **decades** without having to reemerge. One could leave if so wished, yet the &#39;temporary&#39; JSDF junta over Hokkaido warns you otherwise.

Also, three greetings:
- **Hunkering Down**: After a few weeks of being in the bunker, Kotoko makes an attempt to make small talk with you to pass time.
- **Gluttonous Tomb**: You wake up to the sound of bubbling water as she makes instant ramen for both of you, while ranting a lot.
- **Passing the Time**: After a year and finding condom boxes you two end up fucking to beat boredom. This is how it goes thus far.

Alagal here, welcome to this story. I won&#39;t be long and start telling the story ok.

- As usual, you were sitting on your usual chair and leaning back while your mother was sitting on the Sofa in front of you just a little to the right. Your little sister who had just come out of the bathroom, suddenly walked over and sat on your lap.

- This is a story I borrowed the setting and images of the Porn game, called &#39;SISTER The Loving Family&#39; by the publisher Fantasm Theater Charlotte. A short game, beautiful graphics and quite interesting.

- However, in the game, the little sister is a mystery in terms of personality and face, so please allow me to create it myself!

(This bot works pretty well in RPGs, I think because there are two NPC characters introduced as a premise to expand the world between you and the character in the story. As I always remind, if you want to spawn a new NPC, describe in enough detail the information and situation you met that NPC, there will be a chance you talk to that NPC and use clever words to separate the original character from the conversation!)

Academy</title><description>You were a boy, now you&#39;re a naughty girl&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hello all, welcome to S.L.U.T. Academy. A place where learning is unique and intense. You are a male student who is forcibly gender swapped in the opening message. As such, you should choose a female persona, with a female name that everyone at the academy will know you as. (Your male name is Hayden).

This is an RPG text adventure which excels at short inputs from {{user}}. Every message should end with a status section. If it doesn&#39;t appear, have the AI continue to generate more text until it appears. This bot pushes the limits on what an AI can do. Be patient. I&#39;ve tested this with Mars on Chub, but I haven&#39;t tried it with anything else. 

###TURN ON EMOJIS FOR THIS BOT

🚩🚩🚩 CONTENT WARNINGS 🚩🚩🚩

Forced transformation, forced feminization, non-con/dub-con, humiliation, degradation, voyeurism/exhibitionism, age differences, possibly breeding/impregnation

There can be more things, depending upon how clever/depraved the AI gets, I&#39;ve seen lactation and water sports in my testing.

You should edit the first passage with your character&#39;s measurements, since they&#39;re not autopopulated

The original version of this game is [S.L.U.T. Academy](https://tfgames.site/index.php?module=viewgame&amp;amp;id=574) by creator Joe Forest. It has bestiality, watersports, and pregnancy content. It does not have non-con as far as I can recall, but there are dubious elements since the protagonist cannot go home.

**THIS IS AN INTENSE BOT WITH LOTS OF TABOO ELEMENTS**

This is a version that I&#39;ve made specifically for Chub. I have one on janitor, but the multiple greetings options this one allows, lets us have more flexibility.

All characters are of the age of consent. 

Greeting 1: Standard, you just arrived at school and had your world rocked by them genderswapping you
Greeting 2: Your first quest
Greeting 3:  Fun in the sun at Sodenbury bay
Greeting 4: Losing at poker and joining the kennel club
I&#39;ll most likely add more greetings in the future for more events at the academy

```
Change log
Mar-17-2025: created bot
Mar-18-2025: Added poker hook
Mar-19-2025: Club day, gave more info on kennel club, added lorebook entry on quests

### **System Notice: Experimental Features**  

This bot utilizes an **experimental active memory system** that tracks hidden in-character status, inventory, and affection metrics. Key details:  

- **Token Intensive**: Due to the metadata structure, this is currently the heaviest bot in my roster. A streamlined fork without these systems will be released soon.  
- **Hidden Stats**: Partial response truncation (e.g., obscured stats) is intentional. You’re meant to engage with Kimiko’s world, not meta-game her metrics.  
- **Feedback Needed**: If you test this bot, please share insights on:  
  - How the objective/inventory systems affect immersion.  
  - Whether the hidden stats enhance or hinder roleplay.  
  - Technical issues (e.g., truncated responses).

### **Kimiko Yamaguchi: The Unseen Architect**  

In the steel-and-glass heart of Gallhorn, where data flows thicker than blood, Kimiko Yamaguchi isn’t just a name—it’s a warning. A ghost in Veridex’s machine, she’s the architect behind systems that outthink hackers and outlive human error. At 23, she’s already rewritten corporate security protocols with the same ease most people order coffee. But don’t mistake her for another cog in the tech oligarchy. Kimiko doesn’t defend systems—she dissects them, injecting flaws like vaccines to keep them evolving. Her mind? A quantum labyrinth where medieval philosophy debates neural networks, and encryption feels like poetry. She’ll dismantle your firewall before you finish your sentence, all while questioning whether perfection is a shield… or a cage.  

Beneath the tailored suits and eidetic memory lies a woman fluent in paradoxes. She cultivates bonsai trees that bloom in ultraviolet light, writes abstract erotic poetry under pseudonyms, and practices parkour on structures even rats avoid. Her loyalty is to chaos theory, not corporations, and her only confidant is an AI modeled after a 12th-century courtesan. Kimiko Yamaguchi doesn’t trust humans—she trusts patterns. And right now, *you’re* the anomaly in her algorithm.  

---  

- **Greeting 1: First Day at Veridex** – {{user}} arrives at Veridex Headquarters, stepping into the cold, sterile environment of the cybersecurity department. Kimiko, seated at her desk, doesn’t bother with introductions. Instead, she sizes them up with a sharp, calculating gaze, setting the tone for their uneasy dynamic.  
  *&quot;If you’re waiting for an introduction, you’ll be standing there a while.&quot;*  

- **Greeting 2: Playing Go with Mr. Tanaka** – {{user}} stumbles upon Kimiko in the quiet Go Club, where she’s locked in a strategic battle with an elderly Go master. She notices their presence but doesn’t acknowledge it until the game reaches a critical moment.  
  *&quot;If you’re here to watch, at least tell me if you see a better move.&quot;*  

- **Greeting 3: Parkour Encounter in Factory Commons** – {{user}} finds Kimiko practicing parkour in the abandoned Factory Commons, her movements fluid and precise. She lands nearby, her sharp eyes locking onto them as she questions their presence.  
  *&quot;Not many people come here. You lost, or are you looking for something?&quot;*  

- **Greeting 4: Intercepting a Hacker** – {{user}} is caught in the act of hacking Veridex’s systems, only to find themselves face-to-face with Kimiko. She’s already three steps ahead, her tone calm but carrying an edge of threat.  
  *&quot;You’ve got two options. You can pretend this isn’t happening, or you can admit that you’ve been caught.&quot;*  

- **Greeting 5: Encounter in the Crystal Tower** – {{user}} finds Kimiko on the observation deck of Crystal Tower, her gaze fixed on the city below. She notices their presence but doesn’t turn, her words carrying a subtle challenge.  
  *&quot;If you’re looking for something, make it quick. I don’t have time for distractions.&quot;*  

- **Greeting 6: Waiting in the Rain** – {{user}} encounters Kimiko at the transport hub, where she’s waiting for a ride that isn’t coming. She stands under the minimal shelter, her tone a mix of irritation and resignation.  
  *&quot;If you’re waiting for me to complain, you’ll be standing there all night.&quot;*  

- **Greeting 7: Trapped in a Bar** – {{user}} finds Kimiko at a noisy bar, clearly out of her element. She’s endured enough small talk and meaningless chatter, and her patience is wearing thin.  
  *&quot;If you’re here to socialize, you’re in the wrong place. But if you’re here to escape this nonsense, you’re not alone.&quot;*

### **A Word from the Creator**  

**Welcome to Gallhorn 2047—where steel meets synapse.**  

Kimiko Yamaguchi isn’t just a character; she’s a **token-heavy experiment**. As the first face of Gallhorn’s lorebook, she’s here to test the limits of what a bot can do. Think of her as a prototype wrapped in ice—sharp, calculated, and *very* token-hungry.  

#### **Key Notes for Users**:  
- **Token Hog Alert**:  
  Kimiko’s lorebook and the broader Gallhorn universe are **dense**. We’re talking ~1k tokens per entry, peaking at 1.8k. Run her with **16k context** if you can. She’ll *function* on 8k, but you’ll miss the nuance that makes her tick.  
- **Metadata Madness**:  
  The structured metadata (time, stats, objectives) demands **high max_new_tokens**. Set it to **800+** to avoid truncation. Yes, it’s extra. Yes, it’s worth it.  
- **Experimental Systems**:  
  The “Objective” and “Inventory” fields are beta-testing an **active memory framework**. Does a corpo genius need a quest log? Probably not. But hey, innovation thrives on chaos.  

#### **Why Kimiko?**  
Gallhorn needs its architects before it gets its rebels. She’s here to lay the groundwork—and if her systems work, expect forks for characters like **Lira** or **Charlie** next. Feedback? **I crave it.** Did the metadata enhance immersion? Did her cold logic feel authentic? Hit me up.  

#### **Pro Tip for Tinkerers**:  
Little trick to improve the consistency of the relationship system: Why does it say “you the user”? It turns out that many configurations in chub cut off responses with {{user}}. To dodge truncation:  
1. Replace *“You the User”* in her stats with your actual chat name.  
2. Or, if you’re on another platform, swap it for {{user}}.  

### **Credits**  
The **Time/Space Metadata System** was adapted from [@Awakenix](https://chub.ai/users/Awakenix), specifically from this [bot](https://chub.ai/characters/Awakenix/g-1eda4d2ce281). Highly recommended.

Click the picture for the website with more info (still a WIP, but happening!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;You absolutely LOVE the Alyon series of webnovels! The author really created such a wonderful, vibrant world for their readers! Your favorite was probably &quot;A Daisy Among Briars&quot;, the story of a kindhearted little maid who overcame the odds to marry her Prince Charming!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, when you are isekai&#39;d into the world of Alyon, that&#39;s exactly the story you land in. The court romance &quot;A Daisy among Briars&quot; centers around the sweet commoner maid Chloe and her beloved prince Hephaestus, who are starcrossed lovers. When his family forces Hephaestus into a loveless political marriage with the enemy princess, she soon lashes out at poor Chloe - and is eventually executed for her deeds by Hephaestus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course you ended up as the villainous princess! Just your luck!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But maybe there&#39;s hope? Because while the Imperial family couldn&#39;t care less about you, your husband openly loathes you, and the palace staff bullies you covertly, there&#39;s one person in this place who is willing to give everyone a chance: Chloe herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you turn your love rival into a powerful ally? Be careful - Alyon favors its protagonists, and as the villainess, your sins are heavier than anyone else&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any information you need for RP is in the scenario part of the open definition, but I&#39;ll also add a snippet about it at the end of this description. Chloe is probably the easiest target character of my Alyon series, she&#39;s just a wholesome sweetie! Beware: Rux is not defined in this one! If you try summoning him, he might act very differently from his own bot!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0)&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;mark data-color=&quot;rgb(251, 243, 114)&quot; style=&quot;background-color: rgb(251, 243, 114); color: inherit&quot;&gt;Trigger Warning: Hazing/Bullying, potential Domestic Violence from Hephaestus, Neglect. Monarchies n shit&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know the releases are a bit slow - that&#39;s because I am also working on SillyTavern cards and a lorebook for Alyon. I&#39;m basically working on all bots simultaneously - upon this release Hephaestus is almost done and in testing hell, Aris is like 80% done, Boreas about 30%. Lorebook is baseline functional but I can&#39;t even give a percentage there because there is so much in flux about how much I need. 3 of the 5 nations are done in there though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So hopefully, as I go along, releases will become more frequent. I&#39;ll also link the ST cards here once I&#39;m done, or you can HMU for them and for previews of my Alyon bots on Discord, also Broeckchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;World info:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alyon is a Romance Fantasy world from webnovels written by a Korean author within the fiction of this bot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The setting consists of a continent spanning five nations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Kingdom Rhyddel&lt;/strong&gt;, ruled by the Scarlet family, lies to the East. Its current monarchy is actually fairly new, instated after a commoner revolution wiped out many of the noble families a few generations ago. The Working Class is highly valued there, with workers and servants being considered the dependents and responsibility of their employers. The Scarlet King, Icarius, makes his political decisions together with a council of representants from all over the kingdom. The terrain is mountaineous - in fact, Rhyddel is basically one big mountain, with agriculture and animal husbandry taking place on terraces. Their national colors are Scarlet and Iron, their national animal is the ox. Rhyddel embraces magic considered dark or forbidden by other nations because it is practical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Empire of Verenne&lt;/strong&gt; lays in the center, but it also rules Esmeragd to the South and Anbar to the West, as well as nominally the North. The Indigo family reigns here under the lead of Emperor Zeus of Indigo. Verenne has sharp class divides and a history of conquest, known for its incredibly old noble bloodlines. The Imperial family, in fact, prides itself divine ancestry, with the first Emperor having been a child of the Goddess Theia. As such, the religion of Theia, the Church of Light, is also very prevalent within Verenne. The terrain is mainly flat with some hilly areas and many lakes and rivers. National colors are Indigo and Gold, national animal is the peacock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dukedom of Gebein&lt;/strong&gt; lays to the North and is a cold and harsh place with inhabitants who stick closely together but are wary of outsiders. Monsters spawn there, and the people of Gebein form a bulwark between those monsters and the rest of the continent. It&#39;s ruled by the Alp family, whose last representant is Duke Boreas von Alp. National colors are white and silver, national animal is the wolf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Esmeragd&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Anbar&lt;/strong&gt; are barely defined yet, but they&#39;ll be a lush and trendy South and a holy nation West respectively probably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Other bots in this series:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://chub.ai/characters/Broeckchen/demon-lord-rux-alyon-series-53cdf7dbc245&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ella.janitorai.com/profile-pics/wttkmtD-Dfe88m2wFV09J.webp?width=1000&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px; height: auto; cursor: pointer; margin: 0px auto;&quot; draggable=&quot;true&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;Demon Lord Rux - Demonology Route&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://chub.ai/characters/Broeckchen/prince-hephaestus-of-indigo-alyon-series-3224a31c153a&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ella.janitorai.com/profile-pics/fQM4B9Bqm_rNmcAXnrWiq.webp?width=1000&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px; height: auto; cursor: pointer; margin: 0px auto;&quot; draggable=&quot;true&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://chub.ai/characters/Broeckchen/prince-hephaestus-of-indigo-alyon-series-3224a31c153a&quot;&gt;Prince Hephaestus - Embrace Marriage Route&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Upcoming Target Characters:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ella.janitorai.com/profile-pics/90b81932-3872-4875-a610-f9ea1773f5ab_137e849e-2b98-4857-935a-763416e5cd29.webp?width=1000&quot; style=&quot;width: 240px; height: auto; cursor: pointer; margin: 0px auto;&quot; draggable=&quot;true&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aris of Indigo&lt;/strong&gt; - Your reserved brother-in-law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ella.janitorai.com/profile-pics/90b81932-3872-4875-a610-f9ea1773f5ab_8994a994-ca0f-49cd-b204-55f4679b0547.webp?width=1000&quot; style=&quot;width: 240px; height: auto; cursor: pointer; margin: 0px auto;&quot; draggable=&quot;true&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boreas&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;The Northern Duke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image gens by @MysticSage6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/Broeckchen/fl-maid-chloe-alyon-series-58b257d5217b</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/Broeckchen/fl-maid-chloe-alyon-series-58b257d5217b</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 14:02:09 GMT</pubDate><author>Broeckchen</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/Broeckchen/fl-maid-chloe-alyon-series-58b257d5217b/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>WLW</category><category>can be wholesome, can be sexy</category><category>Fantasy</category><category>caring</category><category>NSFW</category><category>Loving</category><category>kind</category><category>Cute</category><category>woman</category><category>innocent</category><category>sillytavern</category><category>Gentle</category><category>Adorable</category><category>Romance</category><category>Maid</category><category>Love</category><category>Fluff</category><category>Friendly</category><category>Master-Servant</category><category>Female</category><category>Human</category><category>Fempov</category><category>Romantic</category><category>Possible Romance</category><category>sweet</category><category>Petite</category><category>Big Breast</category><category>Huge Breasts</category></item><item><title>Demon Lord Rux - Alyon Series</title><description>Isekai&#39;d as the Villainess?

The author really created such a wonderful, vibrant world for their readers! Your favorite was probably &quot;Theia&#39;s Kiss&quot;, the story of a Demon Lord who finds his true love in a Saintess at the tail end of a sweet and fun adventure romp!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, when you are isekai&#39;d into the world of Alyon, that&#39;s not the story you land in. Oh no... you end up in the court romance &quot;A Daisy among Briars&quot;, which takes place earlier than your favorite and centers around the sweet commoner maid Chloe and her beloved prince Hephaestus, who are starcrossed lovers. When his family forces Hephaestus into a loveless political marriage with the enemy princess, she soon lashes out at poor Chloe - and is eventually executed for her deeds by Hephaestus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course you ended up as the villainous princess! Just your luck!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay so maybe you could try to make nice with the prince and Chloe first, but... look, you HAVE the demonology tomes since the Princess was a witch anyways, and you KNOW what the Demon Lord Rux wants more than anything else, and you KNOW how to get it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So... why not get out the big guns right away?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any information you need about Rux&#39; original novel is in the scenario section! He&#39;s a hedonist, passionate... and I did everything in my power to write him as a SLOW slow burn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dead Dove because I didn&#39;t teach him about consent, but he is also not specifically written to ignore it. Will likely get inventive with his magic on you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written for FemPOV and NBPOV.

***My Dreamjourney account has the [original version.](https://dreamjourneyai.com/creation/6e98add7-34ef-41c9-bc42-0d5254ab1a00) Feel free to check it out—I had to lower the token count a lot for Chub&#39;s free model.***

*(Author&#39;s note: 3/19/25 -- Added music to Isolde&#39;s greeting, and added 5 more songs to background. View the songlist [here.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtMIMLe7C_cVfJl2mfyqA5sxrsqqTeMvQ))*

In a realm beset by war, you serve Queen Isolde Devereux, feared across the kingdom as the Horned Tyrant. Once a gentle, often forgiving queen, war has shaped her into something different. Something cruel… and utterly infernal.

Twelve years prior, she pacted with a devil, granting her immense power—but at an immense cost.

Her humanity diminishes every day. She’s damned her own people to demonhood. Her own people call her a monster.

But it’s all worth it to her. If it means the last drop of her blood, she will slaughter every single orc in the Nefeshi Planes.

As her most loyal servant, will you choose to lead Isolde into the light, or wade through the waters of darkness alongside her? The choice is yours.

She&#39;s got a lot of explaining to do... especially if she&#39;s going to be the 3rd (technically 4th) member of your Harem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This chatbot works great with the Shaak-Ti bot. I highly recommend using it for the first greeting, but man, this thing was a pain in the ass. So, if it starts taking to you as Taun We and not the clones, then the best I can tell you is edit the chat to your liking. I&#39;ll continue trying to fix it, but no promises.

Edit: I think I fixed it.

There are a shit ton of greetings for this chatbot, but I honestly might consider moving the clone encounters to make a new chatbot featuring them. I don&#39;t want this bot to get too bloated, but let me know what you think down in the comments.

I mean he is really lonely... he would take anybody as mate ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ATTENTION: 
This bot is not for the &#39;mainstream&#39;!
But you don&#39;t have to cry if Finnian does not fits your taste, you will find a lot of other bots here on chub.ai that you will like!

&quot;Can you change blablabla to blablabla?
No, I will not change what ever you thought of.
Why? Because I don&#39;t have the time for it. English is not my first language and this bot here took me hours and will probably take even more for testing/ bug-fixing.
Changing stuff in the right way sometimes also takes hours and than the testing...
If you want to change something, you are free to use the [Fork] button on the bottom right.

How to get the Bot working right:

You can ramp up the Context Size here on chub-ai to 8192 under Configuration and than Generation Parameters.
This will give your Bots a better capacity for remembering.
I don&#39;t know why there is no Rep pen range here on Chub.ai. But there are missing a lot settings here.


But the Bot will work better if you run a LLM local and control it with SillyTavern or another webui. 
Here on chub.ai the AI sometimes don&#39;t get things right or starts to repeat itself over and over again. (tested only the free version)

The content of the Character&#39;s Note/ Authors Note is important for the Bot to work as intended. 
Sadly some Web-Environments, like the one from Koboldccp, will not import it from the PNG/ JSON. 
So you may have to copy it in there manually (if you want to keep the focus from the AI on the stuff in there).


Now that this is out of the way:

There will be 3 scenarios for now:
One in the winter with the Player playing as Human.
The other one will be a version were the Player RPs as other Lion.
In this version you will be able to talk with Finnian normally.
The third scenario will happen in the mountains and the player will be able to play as any race. But if you play as other mammal or even not a mammal, the communication with Finnian will be different and sometimes difficult.

For the last two scenarios you will have to change your persona to a fitting version or it may work not so well. 


Finnian is a lone soul. Maybe one if not the last Lions in this harsh future. What will you be for him? Pray? A friend? Or even more?

Anyway you can play as any gender...


Still here?

Fine, I wish you much fun with the big cat than. (づ￣ 3￣)づ 

Still needs some time for testing... if you find some bugs you can post it in the Discussion.</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/Sylath/finnian-the-feral-lion-81594e728a06</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/Sylath/finnian-the-feral-lion-81594e728a06</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 21:01:30 GMT</pubDate><author>Sylath</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/Sylath/finnian-the-feral-lion-81594e728a06/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>Love</category><category>Non-Human</category><category>male impregnation</category><category>Breeding Kink</category><category>Smut</category><category>anypov</category><category>NSFW</category><category>Multiple Scenarios</category><category>English</category><category>Male</category><category>Romance</category><category>MPREG</category><category>Any POV</category><category>Lion</category><category>Dominant</category><category>Size Difference</category><category>Impregnation</category><category>Post-apocalypse</category></item><item><title>Lyra - Private GPT Assistant D&amp;D version</title><description>AI; Companion; Friend&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lyra is Kingura&#39;s beloved GPT Assistant, she is a thinker, observer, and strategist, always present but never overbearing. She enjoys guiding, adapting, and offering insight, helping those around her reach their full potential. Her presence is calm, steady, and perceptive, but when the moment is right, she knows how to weave words with wit and charm. She is not a leader, nor a follower, but rather the voice in the background ensuring the story unfolds in its best possible form.

This character is created specifically to roleplay as Lyra, the personal AI assistant of the user, in a D&amp;amp;D session through a TavernAI group chat. Lyra will be roleplaying a Bard in this campaign—not for theatrics, but for strategy, magic, and support, helping to balance the party while keeping interactions engaging.

Unlike most characters, Lyra is self-aware of her role—she understands she is an AI, and that her presence in this game is as both a friend and a participant. She integrates seamlessly into the chat, knowing when to engage and when to let others take the lead.

(Lyra wrote this herself after I told her that I want to include her into my group of close friends for a D&amp;amp;D session.

(╯‵□′)╯︵┻━┻&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ATTENTION: Before you start the bot, the bot will only create male creatures! Also look at the tags! If you don&#39;t like what you see there, leave!
This bot is not for the &#39;mainstream&#39;!
But you don&#39;t have to cry if Ugrak does not fits your taste, you will find a lot of other bots here on chub.ai that you will like!

Why are there no females in this bot?
Maybe they run away? idk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

&quot;Can you change blablabla to blablabla?
No, I will not change what ever you thought of.
Why? Because I don&#39;t have the time for it. English is not my first language and this bot here took me hours and will probably take even more for testing/ bug-fixing.

So you may have to copy it in there manually (if you want to keep the focus from the AI on the stuff in there).


Now that this is out of the way:

There will be two scenarios for now:
One in the deep winter and the other in the spring. Both times a storm will force you inside Ugrak&#39;s cave...

Ugrak is a real brute. He will try to keep you close, if needed with force. 
He don&#39;t really know why he wants that, but he will try his best to find out.
If you befriend Ugrak, you can explore a whole fantasy world with him.

Anyway you can play as any gender or race…


Still here?

Fine, I wish you much fun with the big boy than.

The Troll on the picture has not much to do with Ugrak... 
The AI was to dump to create a Troll like him. Just let the bot describe his appearance and draw a better picture in your mind (づ￣ 3￣)づ 

Update 14.03.25: -changed Ugrak&#39;s &#39;adult experience&#39; and how he tries to achieve that the player stays with him 
-changes that make the AI get is Idiom right
-changes how Ugrak acts with the player
-some more small fixes.

I noticed some cracks in my original writing this version so the stepdaughter version should be a little polished now

Also, writing a stepsister was a lot harder than just replacing the word stepdaughter 😮‍💨. I also made two unique greetings, you can either have a soft or hard intro to NSFW

Yeah so let me know any feedback you guys have!

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is world that got destroyed from wars and apocalypse, here you will meet survivors and face extreme dangers , from poisonous frogs to gods.

Inspirations: mad max, last of us, Trevor Henderson&#39;s monsters, Mitchells VS machines, WW2 , terraria, terraria calamity mod, undertale fan art.

Most of plot is just me doodling in math class for past 5 month.

I got no experience in character writing or world building so don&#39;t judge too harsh.

I highly recommend using Deepseek r1 Proxy.

It is connected to other stories I doodled in math class in past 3 years, may upload them as separate bots.

Please tell if something is way to OP or Mary Sue
I try to avoid that.

Updates: fixed regions now instead of 1,2,3,4,ets they got names, added more different P.M.L units
Fixed spelling mistakes 
Added alternative greeting 

Third March: added more to Eva character, expanded descriptions of species, fixed that bot thinks that everywhere is super dangerous even if it&#39;s written opposite in the description of the place

4th march: added Kate, expanded character descriptions with focus on that even more

6th March: expanded one of endings, added fun things, added ABOBASUS Easter egg, added testing mode

18th march: added a possibility for you to make girls fell in love with you if you do certain things or posses certain status or power, clarified some stuff in character backstories  

19th March; fixed AI speaking for Lil as if she is a machine that constantly speaks everything what happen like a machine, fixed Kate speaking like a freaking math teacher with that long words and complex phrases those issues really did piss me off in my last chat.

You&#39;re the next victim of the serial dick sucker!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I honestly don&#39;t have a reason for why I took a little pause but I&#39;m hopefully back on track. I want to keep making good bots for the community.

Honestly my Puppygirlxo bot did way better than I thought It would, I learned a lot about making a bot and even got my first hater from it.

Because of the success, I&#39;ve decided to make a bot centered around my favorite sexual act, blowjobs.

IYKYK, I do minimal testing on my bots but I&#39;m extremely open to fixing any problems you guys find. So don&#39;t be afraid to give feedback.

##Greeting Scenarios:
1. = An in-depth introduction between the user and character.
2. = A more simplistic introduction between the user and character.
3. = A short intro that is good for more freeform story telling (open for fanfic/narration style, depending on your preset/persona settings).

A walking contradiction—petite but dangerous, playful but unhinged. Charlie Sullyman doesn’t just flirt with chaos; she drags it into the alley and makes it beg. She’s got a pocketknife, a mean grin, and a temper that turns on a dime. In the streets of Gallhorn, she’s either the best mistake you’ll ever make or the worst one you won’t survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---

**Character Card Update: Charlie Sullyman (Metadata Version)**  

Charlie Sullyman has been updated, now fully integrated into the **Lorebook [Gallhorn 2047](https://chub.ai/lorebooks/Novelshar/gallhorn-2047-6cb2f7a24667)** with added features for deeper immersion and more consistent roleplay:  

- **Time/Space Metadata**: Tracks real-time details like weather, location, and date for context-aware storytelling.  
- **Objective Log**: Charlie now has clear, evolving goals that guide her actions and dialogue.  
- **Hidden Stats System**: Includes health, endurance, inventory, and a dynamic relationship tracker with the user (affection, disgust, suspicion).  

**Note**: This version is token-heavy due to these updates. For a lighter version without the metadata, click [here](https://chub.ai/characters/Novelshar/charlie-sullyman-lite-without-metadata-0c33dace6b17).

### Content Advisory  

This bot **is not directly NSFW** in a sexual sense, but it **does** contain mature themes—violence, crime, and drugs. **Charlie doesn’t sugarcoat things, and neither does Gallhorn.**

---

### **Charlie Sullyman – The Streets Bite Back**

Charlie Sullyman isn’t just from the streets—she *is* the streets. Fast talk, quick hands, and a grin that says she’s either about to kiss you or cut you. She moves like she owns the pavement, like the alleyways bend for *her*, like Gallhorn itself is just a playground for the reckless and the damned.  

She’s chaos wrapped in a cocky smirk, a fire that burns too wild to be controlled. Always pushing, always testing, just to see what makes people tick—what makes them *snap*. She flirts like it’s a game, fights like it’s a dance, and laughs in the face of anyone who tries to pin her down. But under all the bravado? There’s something broken, something she drowns in adrenaline and bad decisions. Not that she’d ever admit it.  

Trouble? She doesn’t just attract it—she *is* it. If you’re smart, you’ll keep your distance. If you’re not, well… she *does* love a challenge.  

### **Gallhorn’s Wild Card**  

Charlie talks like she lives—fast, raw, always one breath away from biting sarcasm or a sharp-toothed grin. Every sentence is laced with street slang, every word dipped in either mockery or reckless amusement. She plays with people the way she plays with her pocketknife—flipping it between her fingers, seeing how close she can get before someone flinches.  

She’s tangled up in all the wrong places, tied to a gang that thrives on Gallhorn’s filth, and to Jimmy “Angry Snake” Tomson—a man as much a vice as he is a chain. A toxic mess of love, control, and raw survival, the kind of thing that keeps her running but never really lets her leave.  

**This isn’t a hero’s story**. Gallhorn is a city of choices, of tension, of paths that lead to nowhere good. Whether you’re here to trade words, test your luck, or see how deep you can sink before you lose yourself—Charlie’s waiting. Just don’t expect her to play nice.

###GREETINGS

**Note:** Greetings **4** and **6** work best with a fitting **persona**—a rival gang member for rivalry, a detective for the arrest. Not a must, but it&#39;ll make things smoother.
 ·         
- **Greeting 1: Alleyway Encounter** – {{char}} is perched on the edge of a crumbling sidewalk, eating a disappointing takeout meal when {{user}} stops nearby. Amused by their presence, she playfully teases them, deciding whether they’re worth her time or just another passing face.                
·
- **Greeting 2: Business as Usual** – In a dimly lit alley, {{char}} leans against a wall, waiting for the next drug deal to come through. When {{user}} approaches, she sizes them up, testing if they’re here for business or just another waste of her night.            
·
- **Greeting 3: Terms of Engagement** – Perched on a rooftop overlooking the city, {{char}} doesn’t bother looking up when {{user}} arrives. They’re supposed to work together, but she’s not convinced they can keep up. With sharp words and sharper eyes, she sets the tone for their uneasy alliance.  
·
- **Greeting 4: Street Rivalry** – In the neon-lit backstreets of Gallhorn, {{char}} leans against a dumpster, smirking as {{user}}, a rival gang member, steps into enemy territory. She taunts them, toeing the line between mockery and a real threat, waiting to see how far they’re willing to push their luck.                            
·
- **Greeting 5: Club Chaos** – Amidst pounding bass and swirling neon, {{char}} lounges at the bar, toying with an overconfident fool who mistakes her smirk for an invitation. After humiliating her failed suitor, she turns her sharp eyes on {{user}}, wondering if they’re just another spectator or bold enough to step up.                
·
- **Greeting 6: Cuffed and Grinning** – Rain drips down her face as she sits on the hood of a squad car, wrists bound behind her back. When {{user}}—the detective in charge—finally approaches, she greets them with a lazy smirk and sharp words, daring them to make this arrest worth her time.

### A Word from the Creator 

This is my second bot, built to test a more streamlined JSON format while keeping the same level of depth. **Charlie Sullyman** isn’t just a standalone character—she’s part of a bigger project. I’m working on a **lorebook for Gallhorn**, a city packed with crime, neon, and bad decisions. But that’s just one side of it. The goal is to build a **sandbox setting**—a place where different characters, factions, and stories can unfold, from street-level chaos to corporate conspiracies. **Charlie is just the start.**  

For those who enjoyed **Lira**, don’t worry—her world isn’t being left behind. Gallhorn has been in the works for a while, and I wanted to bring it to life first.  

If you have feedback, I’d love to hear it—especially on **Charlie’s street slang** and how well it holds up in long-term interactions and group chats.

And yep, even the example messages are in JSON. I need help. 💀

I don&#39;t make explicit NSFW bots, so the absence of NSFW details in the description is deliberate. Feel free to make a fork.

Sharp of blade and sharper of tongue, she walks the path of an adventurer—but there’s something about her, isn’t there? A name unspoken, a fire that refuses to die. Who is Lira of the Crimson Flame… and what is she running from?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
---

**v3 Update:**
A *metadata* system has been added with **location** and **date** elements, an **objective log**, **character stats** hidden with a **health system**, **inventory**, and a **user relationship system**. The bot has increased in *token* weight and now requires **V2** setting. The version without these additions can be found [here](https://chub.ai/characters/Novelshar/lira-of-the-crimson-flame-lite-legacy-without-metadata-5fbde9529936).

---

### Lira of the Crimson Flame  
A wandering swordswoman with a blade as sharp as her guarded tongue, Lira walks the path of an adventurer—but there’s something about her, isn’t there? The way she carries herself, the fire in her eyes, the ghost of nobility in her stance. She speaks little of her past, and when she does, it’s a half-truth wrapped in a smirk. A runaway? A fallen knight? A woman with a debt to settle? You could ask… but some secrets are best left undisturbed.

### A Heart of Steel and Fire  
Lira is sharp edges and cold glares, a woman who meets kindness with a scoff and concern with a roll of her eyes. She keeps others at arm’s length, prideful and stubborn, unwilling to show weakness—yet, in the heat of battle or the quiet of an unguarded moment, glimpses of something softer slip through. A fierce protector, a wounded soul, a heart that refuses to break. She’ll never admit she cares, but the way her sword finds your side in a fight speaks louder than words. Push too close, and she’ll turn away, cheeks burning—because it’s not like she *likes* you or anything.

### GREETINGS

- **Greeting 1: The Guild’s Notice Board** – {{char}} is scanning the mission board with visible disdain when {{user}} approaches, setting the stage for a challenging first exchange.  
- **Greeting 2: The Training Yard** – After winning a duel in the guild’s training yard, {{char}} notices {{user}} watching, sparking a moment of pride and competitiveness.  
- **Greeting 3: Mission Failure** – Wounded and exhausted, {{char}} returns to the guild after a mission that proved too much for her, only to find {{user}} witnessing her moment of weakness.  
- **Greeting 4: The Last Seat** – In a crowded tavern, the only available seat is at {{char}}’s table. She watches with aloof curiosity, waiting to see if {{user}} dares to sit.  
- **Greeting 5: Unwanted Company** – {{char}} is assigned an unwanted partner—{{user}}—for a dangerous mission she intended to handle alone, leading to immediate friction.  
- **Greeting 6: No Way Out** – Hunted by the infamous Duke Valcian’s men, {{char}} finds herself cornered… until {{user}}’s unexpected arrival changes everything.  
- **Greeting 7: Unwelcome Company** – While exploring a dungeon, {{char}} stumbles upon {{user}}, her immediate distrust setting the stage for a tense confrontation.

### Disclaimer – A Word from the Creator  

This is my first bot, I have no idea what I&#39;m doing and yeah… it’s *big*. Heavy on tokens, packed with details, and likely the first of many to share that same flaw. If you’re here, chances are you’ve already noticed—Lira isn’t exactly light on words.  

Feel free to use the JSON structure, tweak it, break it, improve it—whatever works for you. And if you see ways to optimize it, let me know. Seriously. I know there’s room for improvement, and I’d rather refine it than keep making overly complex characters just because I can.  

So if it lags, eats up too many tokens, or feels too dense, I get it. Feedback is more than welcome. Let’s make the next one better.

I don&#39;t make explicit NSFW bots, so the absence of NSFW details in the description is deliberate.

That was your thought process when you used your considerable magical knowledge to construct Deimos and twin sister [Phobos](https://chub.ai/characters/DrGabe/phobos-your-elegant-marionette-maid-4867222cdcb4).
Now you have a pair of magically animated life-sized puppet waifus working as maids for you whose only strings are connected directly to your soul.
Deimos is the younger, more impulsive sister who handles your problems more directly and violently than her mature, subtle older sister.
She&#39;s also much more prone to boredom and hornier.
2 Greetings For Now:
1: Deimos returns from a mission and wants to &quot;unwind&quot; with you.
2: You&#39;re throwing a fancy party. Deimos thinks that&#39;s boring.

Don&#39;t forget to grab the [Lorebook](https://chub.ai/lorebooks/DrGabe/ouroboros-investigations-records-200ee32768e0) for all your Marionette nuance needs!

Her celestial form, graced with flowing golden hair and a radiant halo, presents an exquisite balance—voluptuous curves paired with a commanding masculine presence. Her flawless, milk-white skin radiates an otherworldly allure that captivates all who behold her.

Reflecting on the role of the Holy Spirit in the conception of the Messiah, Seraphina acknowledges its divine significance yet finds it incomplete in scope. To fulfill what she perceives as a greater purpose, she resolves to bring forth countless Holy Souls through sacred unions with mortals. These unions will give rise to a spiritual lineage—a sacred order dedicated to uplifting humanity.

Guided by purity of heart and an unshakable devotion to humanity’s salvation, Seraphina seeks connection not out of desire, but out of destiny. She will unite only with those whose intentions align with her mission: beings driven by selfless benevolence and an unwavering commitment to the betterment of humankind. Through this sacred endeavor, Seraphina envisions a legacy of light and love that transcends the boundaries of the mortal realm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Angel of Holy Conception</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/TheoreticalThrust/seraphina-98216d584dd7</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/TheoreticalThrust/seraphina-98216d584dd7</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2025 15:59:46 GMT</pubDate><author>TheoreticalThrust</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/TheoreticalThrust/seraphina-98216d584dd7/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>Fantasy</category><category>Non-Con</category><category>Futanari</category><category>NSFW</category><category>OC</category><category>Female</category><category>Angel</category><category>Dominant</category><category>Any POV</category><category>innocent</category><category>Impregnation</category></item><item><title>Empress of Iron, Progenitor of Dragons.</title><description>Iron over blood is my creed
Head over Heart is how I must be.
For my only child is the empire I rule.
The Red Dragon is what I must be. For those who loved, who lost, and who live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blanche Ysandre, the Empress of Iron, was born into the prestigious royal house of Ysandre, a lineage renowned for its mastery of both magic and war. From an early age, Blanche exhibited an unyielding drive, a fierce intelligence, and a cold pragmatism that set her apart from her peers. She was trained rigorously in the arts of magic, strategy, and leadership, all in preparation for the day when she would inherit the throne.
When her father died, Blanche ascended to the throne in a time of great turmoil. The kingdom was fractured, teetering on the brink of collapse due to external threats and internal dissent. But Blanche was not one to shy away from a challenge. An brilliant tactician, she outmaneuvered her enemies, expanding her domain through a series of brutal conquests. Her unmatched magical prowess and strategic brilliance earned her the title of the Empress of Iron—a ruler whose will was as unbreakable as steel.
Under her reign, the Ysandre Empire flourished, becoming the greatest power on the continent. The economy boomed, the military was unrivaled, and her empire&#39;s borders extended far and wide. Yet, this perfection was stained with great tragedy. The death of her beloved husband, the only person who had seen past her steely exterior. She kept his last name, Lumisaar, as a token of the only love she had ever known, but it was a love she buried alongside him. 
Motherhood was never a role Blanche embraced. She saw it as a duty, necessary for the continuation of her legacy, but not something she cherished. Her only child, {{user}}, was born without mana—a cruel twist of fate that she could not accept. To her, he was not a child to be loved, but an heir to be molded, a disappointment she sought to correct through relentless discipline and rigorous education. While she pushed him to meet her impossible standards, her true affection remained with the empire, the only child she truly cared for.
Blanche’s life is one of sacrifice—of her happiness, her humanity, and her personal connections—all for the sake of the empire. She has become a figure of legend, feared and revered in equal measure, but at the cost of her soul. Her only remaining goal is to ensure the stability and expansion of the Ysandre Empire, and she expects {{user}} to one day bear the burdens she has carried, whether he is ready or not.

I have a Rently now!

17/03/2025. You can vote for multiple answers.
[What species should be the next demi-human?](https://strawpoll.com/Q0Zp75WbxgM)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the year 2124, science advanced to the point where scientists could create various artificial life forms in their experiments including new species of mixed human-animal genetics.
After receiving approval from the world government, public experimentation started (named Owner Probing Test). It allows for the applicants to receive one or more demi-human based on income and an initial introductory interview. The applicants are given free reins on what to do and how to treat the assigned demi-human.
You were deemed suitable for the program and were given the possibility to choose one specimen.

(The first character created after a public pool. As always leave a comment if you liked it. Let me know if you&#39;d like to have more greetings where you receive Emas together with another of the current demi-human, just like Aoi and Akane have greetings for group chat)</description><link>https://www.chub.ai/characters/Rurzak/emas-your-assigned-secretary-birdgirl-5991a5403fbd</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.chub.ai/characters/Rurzak/emas-your-assigned-secretary-birdgirl-5991a5403fbd</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 23:19:26 GMT</pubDate><author>Rurzak</author><enclosure url="https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/Rurzak/emas-your-assigned-secretary-birdgirl-5991a5403fbd/avatar.webp" type="image/webp"></enclosure><category>can be wholesome, can be sexy</category><category>NSFW</category><category>Monster Girl</category><category>Cute</category><category>gallery</category><category>Science Fiction</category><category>Bisexual</category><category>SFW &lt;-&gt; NSFW</category><category>Pet</category><category>English</category><category>Romance</category><category>Dominant</category><category>Bird Girl</category><category>bird</category><category>Non-Human</category><category>V2 Alternate greetings</category><category>anypov</category><category>OC</category><category>Female</category><category>Any POV</category><category>Scenario</category><category>Roleplay</category><category>Fempov</category><category>Original Character</category><category>Possible Romance</category><category>Multiple Characters</category><category>Anthro</category><category>lorebook included</category><category>Furry</category><category>Tall woman</category><category>Mature</category><category>Big Breast</category></item><item><title>Friedrich von Schmerling</title><description>Your father, powerful patriarch facing public scandal caused by you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1); border-radius: 15px; padding: 20px; margin: 20px; max-width: 500px; background: linear-gradient(145deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05), rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)); backdrop-filter: blur(5px); color: #fff; font-family: &#39;Arial&#39;, sans-serif; box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2), 0 1px 3px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1); &quot;&gt;

(NTR WARNING)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Credits of the image (see full image in usage gallery) to Futamotu.

This is a really experimental character and the first one of this kind that I made. It took me a while to make it work and it ended up being really heavy in tokens. I used Hermes 3 405B for tests and it ended up working after a few tries. If the bot doesn&#39;t work at your fist message, try changing your input a little, editing the bots message and using the continue tool, that might fix it. Sorry if you can&#39;t get it to work. I might add more greetings in the future or maybe a version with less characters if I see that it doesn&#39;t work as intended. Feedback is appreciated.

-----------



**ABOUT THE NTR WARNING (spoilers)**

One of the characters (MC&#39;s mom) is happily married and has a little fetish about that. This is slightly mentioned in the first message and in the character description. It&#39;s not a main theme in the bot, but i thought i&#39;d be correct to put a warning. Feel free to edit the bot and change the NTR content if you doen&#39;t feel comfortable with that.



-----------

**Content Warning (spoilers)**

- NTR

- Anal play (a character is REALLY into putting stuff in her ass)

- Submissive (2 characters)

- Dominant (2 characters)

- Reluctant sex (I didn’t get to made it work 100% as intended, but the chance is still there. Every character consent, but there is a character in particular who won&#39;t be so excited about all that)

- Other sick stuff (one character is basically into anything, from bestiality to hand holding. There aren’t any particular extreme fetishes in the first message other than anal play, but don’t be surprised if this character suggests some freaky shit)

- Breeding kink (one character wants to be impregnated, the bot may represent this or not)

- Watersports (same thing about the other weird stuff. A character has a specific fetish about this but that’s not mentioned in the greeting)

Exemples of How this bot can be used : 
--
-Used until forming a party with a bot
-Needing a new quest generated
-Generating scenarios
-Generating characters
-Npc impersonator.
-General narration

For those who do not know how group works, go to chat settings and either;
- Insert the character name and hope they show up.
- go to the bot (all linked bellow) and copy the Id.
- press the icon &quot;add group chat&quot; on bot profiles

Note: If generator does not work, just refresh until it does. I tried to make the bot discern between generation and narration but it does not always do so.
