&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot; class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The Arc Prize Foundation, a nonprofit co-founded by prominent AI researcher François Chollet, announced in a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://arcprize.org/blog/announcing-arc-agi-2-and-arc-prize-2025&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; on Monday that it has created a new, challenging test to measure the general intelligence of leading AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;So far, the new test, called ARC-AGI-2, has stumped most models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;“Reasoning” AI models like OpenAI’s o1-pro and DeepSeek’s R1 score between 1% and 1.3% on ARC-AGI-2, according to the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://arcprize.org/leaderboard&quot;&gt;Arc Prize leaderboard&lt;/a&gt;. Powerful non-reasoning models including GPT-4.5, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash score around 1%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The ARC-AGI tests consist of puzzle-like problems where an AI has to identify visual patterns from a collection of different-colored squares, and generate the correct “answer” grid. The problems were designed to force an AI to adapt to new problems it hasn’t seen before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The Arc Prize Foundation had over 400 people take ARC-AGI-2 to establish a human baseline. On average, “panels” of these people got 60% of the test’s questions right — much better than any of the models’ scores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;In a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://x.com/fchollet/status/1904265979192086882&quot;&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt;, Chollet claimed ARC-AGI-2 is a better measure of an AI model’s actual intelligence than the first iteration of the test, ARC-AGI-1. The Arc Prize Foundation’s tests are aimed at evaluating whether an AI system can efficiently acquire new skills outside the data it was trained on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Chollet said that unlike ARC-AGI-1, the new test prevents AI models from relying on “brute force” — extensive computing power — to find solutions. Chollet previously acknowledged &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/09/a-test-for-agi-is-closer-to-being-solved-but-it-may-be-flawed/&quot;&gt;this was a major flaw of ARC-AGI-1.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;To address the first test’s flaws, ARC-AGI-2 introduces a new metric: efficiency. It also requires models to interpret patterns on the fly instead of relying on memorization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;“Intelligence is not solely defined by the ability to solve problems or achieve high scores,” Arc Prize Foundation co-founder Greg Kamradt wrote in a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://arcprize.org/blog/announcing-arc-agi-2-and-arc-prize-2025&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “The efficiency with which those capabilities are acquired and deployed is a crucial, defining component. The core question being asked is not just, ‘Can AI acquire [the] skill to solve a task?’ but also, ‘At what efficiency or cost?&#39;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;ARC-AGI-1 was unbeaten for roughly five years until December 2024, when OpenAI released its &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/20/openai-announces-new-o3-model/&quot;&gt;advanced reasoning model, o3&lt;/a&gt;, which outperformed all other AI models and matched human performance on the evaluation. However, as we noted at the time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/23/openais-o3-suggests-ai-models-are-scaling-in-new-ways-but-so-are-the-costs/&quot;&gt;o3’s performance gains on ARC-AGI-1 came with a hefty price tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The version of OpenAI’s o3 model — o3 (low) — that was first to reach new heights on ARC-AGI-1, scoring 75.7% on the test, got a measly 4% on ARC-AGI-2 using $200 worth of computing power per task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The arrival of ARC-AGI-2 comes as many in the tech industry are calling for new, unsaturated benchmarks to measure AI progress. Hugging Face’s co-founder, Thomas Wolf, recently told TechCrunch that &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/19/the-ai-leaders-bringing-the-agi-debate-down-to-earth/&quot;&gt;the AI industry lacks sufficient tests to measure the key traits of so-called artificial general intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, including creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Alongside the new benchmark, the Arc Prize Foundation announced &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://arcprize.org/competition&quot;&gt;a new Arc Prize 2025 contest&lt;/a&gt;, challenging developers to reach 85% accuracy on the ARC-AGI-2 test while only spending $0.42 per task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot; class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/27/nvidia-drops-600bn-off-its-market-cap-amid-the-rise-of-deepseek/&quot;&gt;DeepSeek briefly crashed Nvidia’s stock&lt;/a&gt; because of speculation that its models require far fewer chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Now, Chinese fintech giant Ant Group, which is backed by Alibaba founder Jack Ma, is claiming a major AI breakthrough. Ant was able to use Chinese chips made by Alibaba and Huawei to create methods that cut AI training costs by 20%, Bloomberg &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-24/jack-ma-backed-ant-touts-ai-breakthrough-built-on-chinese-chips&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;, citing sources familiar with the matter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;What’s more, the Chinese-made chips performed about as well as Nvidia chips during Ant Group’s tests, Bloomberg sources claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;If these Chinese chips catch on, it could harm &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/26/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-shrugs-off-deepseek-as-sales-soar/&quot;&gt;Nvidia’s current and highly lucrative status&lt;/a&gt; as the most popular AI chip producer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Nvidia chips remain highly-sought after, including in China, where buyers are reportedly getting its &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/03/chinese-buyers-are-getting-nvidia-blackwell-chips-despite-u-s-export-controls/&quot;&gt;latest Blackwell chip despite U.S. export controls.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Ant Group and Nvidia didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot; class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Last year, AI-powered sales automation startup 11x appeared to be on an explosive growth trajectory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;However, nearly two dozen sources — including investors and current and former employees — told TechCrunch that the company has experienced financial struggles, largely of its own making.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Numerous people in the U.S. and U.K. told TechCrunch that the situation has become so tenuous that 11x’s lead Series B investor, Andreessen Horowitz, may even be considering legal action.&amp;nbsp;However, a spokesperson for Andreessen Horowitz emphatically denied such rumblings, telling TechCrunch that a16z is not suing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;11x offers an AI bot for outbound cold sales duties, including identifying prospects, crafting custom messages, and scheduling sales calls. It’s one of a number of AI startups in the hot area known as AI sales development representatives, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/26/ai-sdr-startups-are-booming-so-why-are-vcs-wary/&quot;&gt;or AI SDRs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Founded in 2022 by Hasan Sukkar, 11x said it &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/16/ai-digital-employee-startup-11xai-raises-24m-led-by-benchmark/&quot;&gt;approached $10 million&lt;/a&gt; in annualized recurring revenue (ARR) just two years after launch. It moved from London to Silicon Valley last July and announced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/16/ai-digital-employee-startup-11xai-raises-24m-led-by-benchmark/&quot;&gt;$24 million Series A&lt;/a&gt; led by Benchmark in September. TechCrunch broke the news of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/30/11x-ai-a-developer-of-ai-sales-reps-has-raised-50m-series-b-led-by-a16z-sources-say/&quot;&gt;$50 million Series B&lt;/a&gt; led by Andreessen Horowitz later that month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Three current and former 11x workers told TechCrunch that most of its early customers took advantage of “break clauses” in their sales contracts to discontinue using the product. Customers faced issues such as the emailing product not working as expected or hallucinations, according to sources.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;There was some internal drama, too. Employees described an arduous, stressful work environment — even for those who embrace hustle culture. They pointed out that out of the early employees in &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/11/11xai-closes-2-million-pre-seed-to-create-autonomous-ai-workers/&quot;&gt;the photo published by TechCrunch at the company’s launch,&lt;/a&gt; only Sukkar, the CEO, remains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot; id=&quot;h-fake-customer-endorsements&quot;&gt;Fake customer endorsements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Like many startups, 11x proudly showcases customer logos on its website that signify customer endorsements and are typically shown with a customer’s consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;However, TechCrunch learned that multiple companies with logos on 11x’s website were not actual customers and that at least one is threatening legal action over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;“We did not give them permission to use our logo in any manner, and we are not a customer,” a ZoomInfo spokesperson told TechCrunch. The logo wasn’t removed until after March 6, when a source close to TechCrunch inquired about it. But even after that date, the company’s phone AI agent continued to repeat the customer claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;ZoomInfo, which offers sales data and automation tools, conducted a short, one-month trial of the AI SDR from mid-January through mid-February, the spokesperson said. “During the pilot, 11x’s product performed significantly worse than our SDR employees, and we did not move forward afterward.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;And yet “since November, 11x has been claiming us as a customer in a multitude of channels: in sales calls, on its website, and now even on its AI dialer. We’ve spent the past four months demanding that they stop displaying our logo and falsely counting us as a customer,” the spokesperson said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;ZoomInfo’s lawyer is now threatening legal action, according to an email seen by TechCrunch from ZoomInfo’s lawyer to Sukkar. The lawyer wrote that he sees “several legal causes of action including but not limited to deceptive trade practices, trademark infringement, misappropriation of goodwill, and false advertising.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Likewise, Airtable’s logo was featured on the 11x website until a few weeks ago and, as of March 20, 11x’s website still named Airtable as a “customer” on the company’s “manifesto” page. Airtable told TechCrunch it wasn’t a customer and never gave 11x permission to use its logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Airtable also conducted a “very short” trial of the product late last year, “and ultimately decided that it wasn’t a fit for our business,” an Airtable spokesperson told TechCrunch. “It was never used in production and never rolled out to our sales team.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;And yet even as of March 21, 11x was still claiming Airtable as a customer on its website. And another company, which asked not to be named, told TechCrunch a similar story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Our research did show, however, some customer claims were legit. Pleo and Rho, for example, confirmed that they are using 11x products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;11x insists it “promptly removed any undesired or inaccurate customer mentions on their site and within their products when requested” and in the “small number of cases” when it didn’t, that was “due to human error.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot; id=&quot;h-a-creative-way-to-calculate-arr&quot;&gt;A creative way to calculate ARR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, at least three employees said they left the company because of what they perceived as shady tactics at the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;For example, 11x was “adamant” that prospects wishing to conduct pilot programs sign a one-year contract, a prospective customer said. “They were resistant to signing any sort of trial or letting us experiment,” this prospective customer continued.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Instead, 11x offered customers a break clause, typically at three months, that made it easy for customers to break the contract. This worked essentially as a trial period, these former employees and potential customer said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;But when reporting annual recurring revenue (ARR), the company didn’t differentiate between trial periods and long-term customers, former and current employees said. The company would calculate ARR based on the full year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;11x says that it “uses contracted ARR (CARR)” when reporting to the board and that its investors were aware it used that metric. 11x says investors reviewed customer contracts, customer data files and spoke to customers during their due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Even after prospects used the break clause to end their trial — and their payments — the company continued to count ARR as if these companies were completing the full-year contract, these people said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The 11x spokesperson says the startup does offer “free trials” and the “majority of middle market customers” qualify for that, but says that some enterprise customers with “highly specialized” and customized needs “require a 12-month contract with an opt-out after 3 months.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The churn rate — the number of companies not continuing long-term — was high, multiple employees said. “We were losing 70-80% of customers that came through the door,” one employee said. That allowed 11x to “look like it’s doing better than it is,” the person continued.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;For example, the company might say it had $14 million in annual recurring revenue when in reality, the number of contracts that passed the three-month trial period totaled only about $3 million, the employee said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;“They absolutely massaged the numbers internally when it came to growth and churn,” another former employee said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;11x says that its “highest churn” occurred for “initial cohorts in late 2023” but improvements in the product and refining sales to its “ideal customer” have improved retention. 11x says its “retention rate is currently 79%.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The problem wasn’t necessarily that 11x was using CARR to showcase its growth, venture capitalists say, but that investors expect startups to disclose potential opt-out revenue — and customer churn.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Benchmark says it has been provided transparent updates from 11x, including the break clauses, a spokesperson tells TechCrunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot; id=&quot;h-product-underwhelms&quot;&gt;Product underwhelms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Many companies canceled after their trial because they were not happy with the product, according to at least one current and four former employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Some churn was because customers had unrealistic expectations, hoping that 11x could replace an entire outbound sales team, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, one former employee said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;This person said that 11x salespeople often told prospects that within several months, they could expect to see a sizable uptick in the number of meetings, demos, and phone calls booked because of the startup’s technology — despite the employees believing this to be unrealistic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;“The actual results of the amount of automated emails versus meetings booked was disappointing,” said one company that tried the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;11x says it believes its product outperforms human SDRs but says “performance ultimately relies on the quality of user input.” It also says it does not guarantee savings or revenues in its sales pitches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Other customers complained that the 11x product was hallucinating or that the product wouldn’t load at all, this former employee continued. One reviewer on &lt;a href=&quot;https://saassalesdirector.medium.com/11x-ai-review-worth-the-hype-a33e89a9716f&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; panned the product, saying it was far less effective and yet cost more than its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;“The products barely work,” a former engineer told TechCrunch. Instead, customers would have to manually check and correct the work, defeating the purpose of buying 11x’s product in the first place, another employee said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Additionally, the company sometimes had billing issues. One customer was billed twice for their three-month trial period. “It almost seemed like they were kind of trying to get something past us,” the customer said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;One VC considering investing in the Series A discovered that the tech didn’t work well during the due diligence process. 11x’s existing customers told the investor that they were initially satisfied but that after a month of usage, the startup’s AI failed to generate effective leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Told about this investor’s experience, a current employee defended the company, saying that customers need time to adapt to how 11x works. This person said the company is also trying to find ways to encourage more customers to stay longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot; id=&quot;h-employee-churn-nbsp&quot;&gt;Employee churn&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Employees also described a rough work environment with a lot of employee churn under founder-CEO Sukkar.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Employees were generally expected to work at least 60 hours a week with heavy pressure to be constantly available, according to employees and messages seen by TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Slack messages show Sukkar asking where everyone was at 8 p.m., after previously telling employees that the workday started at 9 a.m.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;“He doesn’t believe in people taking holidays,” a current employee said. Another former employee said they were also expected to work over the weekend and on national holidays.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;“You would have the founder on Slack, maybe three in the morning, sending messages saying ‘this needs to be resolved urgently,’” a former employee recalled, adding that the always-on mentality was so pervasive that some employees simply slept in the office.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;When employees couldn’t be reached immediately — or if something was amiss — Sukkar was known to post his frustrations about said worker in the general Slack channel for everyone to see, at least two employees recalled.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Employees who spoke out risked being threatened with dismissal, according to two employees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;“There’s a lot more under the hood,” a current employee said, referring to Sukkar. “One day, there will be a documentary about this guy. I do believe that’s how scandalous he is.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;11x says it experienced turnover as it relocated from London to San Fransisco last July as employees who couldn’t relocate decided to leave the company. It says its headcount has doubled in that time period to now include 50 full-time employees&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;At least one former employee we spoke to said they are still awaiting back pay months after having departed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The concern over backpay after quitting has become such a part of the culture that a current employee said most wait for the nearest payday to pass before quitting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;“We’ve just got paid today,” a current employee said. “I’m expecting a couple of people to resign over the weekend or on Monday.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;In its statement, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plenty.ag/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Plenty&lt;/a&gt; said it has received a commitment for $20.7 million in debtor-in-possession financing as part of a proposed restructuring plan. It plans to continue to operate a strawberry farm in Virginia and a plant science research and development (R&amp;amp;D) center in Wyoming.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Debtor-in-possession financing is financing for firms in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Since its 2014 inception, South San Francisco-based Plenty has raised nearly $1 billion in funding from a variety of investors, including SoftBank Investment Advisers, Walmart, Bezos Expeditions, and Jeff Bezos as an angel investor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Its last known valuation was $1.9 billion at the time of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plenty.ag/plenty-secures-400-million-series-e/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;a $400 million Series E fundraise&lt;/a&gt; in January 2022, according to PitchBook.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The industry has been hard hit by bankruptcies in recent years. In November 2024, agtech unicorn Bowery Farming was reported to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/bowery-farming-is-ceasing-operations/&quot;&gt;shutting down&lt;/a&gt; after raising more than $700 million in funding and last being valued at $2 billion in 2021. And in 2023, AeroFarms and AppHarvest filed for bankruptcy protection. AeroFarms had raised more than $300 million from backers before filing for bankruptcy. In September 2023, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aerofarms.com/aerofarms-emerges-fully-funded-from-chapter-11/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;exited bankruptcy protection&lt;/a&gt; fully funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot; class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foundersfuture.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Founders Future&lt;/a&gt;, a Paris-based VC firm with €300 million in assets under management (around $324 million at current exchange rates), is opening up the capital of the holding company that manages Founders Future’s funds and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sowefund.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Sowefund&lt;/a&gt;. The company has sold a 25% stake in the holding company to MACSF, the Dassault family, CMA CGM Group, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Since 2018, Founders Future has had an interesting track record with some early-stage bets in &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/15/lydia-the-french-social-payment-app-with-8-million-users-launches-mobile-banking-app-sumeria/&quot;&gt;Lydia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/10/bnpl-payment-startup-alma-raises-another-130-million-round/&quot;&gt;Alma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/taster-grabs-38-million-for-its-native-online-restaurants/&quot;&gt;Taster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/12/how-la-fourche-an-online-organic-supermarket-is-thriving-after-q-commerces-bust/&quot;&gt;La Fourche&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/riot-raises-30-million-for-its-cybersecurity-product-suite-focused-on-employees/&quot;&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/european-embedded-banking-startup-swan-adds-another-44-million-to-its-series-b/&quot;&gt;Swan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/yuka-the-app-that-rates-food-and-makeup-lets-users-complain-to-brands-with-its-new-feature/&quot;&gt;Yuka&lt;/a&gt;, and many other startups we’ve covered here at TechCrunch. Overall, the firm has invested in 110 companies across two early-stage funds and a growth fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Founders Future has set an ambitious goal for 2030. The firm wants to reach €1 billion in assets under management, which means raising new funds at a rapid pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;“In a world where you’ve got a lot of personal initiatives in VC firms — because you’ve got a lot of solo GPs starting up, you’ve got a lot of super angels — we’re creating a company,” founding partner Marc Menasé told me. “And so we wrote our roadmap for 2030. As we were writing this roadmap, we used that opportunity to reopen our capital in a slightly more structured way to give us the means to achieve our ambitions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;With this influx of cash, Founders Future plans to expand to the U.S., hire a team, and open two offices — one on the East Coast and another one on the West Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;“I made a simple observation. You look at the companies that are started in Europe and that eventually have found a very good product-market fit and generate significant revenue in their country of origin,” Menasé said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;“What happens is that when they arrive in the U.S.&amp;nbsp;… they multiply their ARR by two or three times after 36 months operating in the United States. They generally have a much better capacity to raise money from American investors, and at much higher valuations — generally twice as much as in Europe,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;He believes startups based in the U.S. reach higher valuations because they have more exit opportunities, especially when it comes to acquisitions by larger companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;“So when you put all this together, we want to become a global company and make sure we have one European arm and one American arm, and create a transatlantic bridge,” Menasé said. “We’re doing this first for our portfolio companies that were born in Europe so that they can expand over there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;But Founders Future doesn’t just want to open a business development outpost. It is going to raise a growth fund focused on American investments. The idea here is to help its European limited partners invest in American tech companies through Funders Future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Conversely, the firm believes it can help American companies expand to Europe. Having a European VC firm on its cap table can be helpful when it comes to navigating the European tech and policy landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;“We’ll start with humble goals, with investment tickets ranging between $5 and $10 million in growth rounds of at least $50, $60 or $70 million,” Menasé said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Fundraising hasn’t started for this fund just yet, but Founders Future hopes it can raise as much as $250 million. And I wouldn’t be surprised if MACSF, the Dassault family and CMA CGM Group end up investing in this U.S.-focused growth fund in addition to Founders Future’s holding company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot; class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The Trump administration’s national security leaders accidentally included the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/?gift=kPTlqn0J1iP9IBZcsdI5IVJpB2t9BYyxpzU4sooa69M&amp;amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=share&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;in a chat on Signal&lt;/a&gt; discussing confidential plans to attack Yemen’s Houthis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;“I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,” Goldberg wrote of the March 15 messages, which Goldberg received two hours before the U.S. dropped its bombs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Goldberg first thought that he was being mislead by bad actors trying to plant a false story in the Atlantic. But a spokesperson from the National Security Council later confirmed to the Atlantic that this was an authentic message chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot; class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Developer tooling is changing rapidly with AI. So companies that are making it easier to adopt AI in their workflows are seeing a boom of attention. After a startup called &lt;a href=&quot;https://n8n.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;n8n&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced “enay-ten”) pivoted its workflow automation platform to become more AI-friendly in 2022, it said it saw its revenues increase 5X, doubling in the last two months alone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Now on the back of that growth, TechCrunch has confirmed that n8n has raised €55 million ($60 million) in funding on a valuation sources close to the company tell us is in the region of €250 million ($270 million).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Berlin-based n8n said it now has more than 3,000 enterprise customers and around 200,000 active users on its books. The startup will be using this Series B to continue investing in tech and to expand in newer markets like the U.S., home to more than half of n8n’s user base. The company does not disclose revenues, and that customer number includes both free and paying users, as well as those taking short-term and longer-term subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Highland Europe is leading this latest round, with HV Capital and previous backers Sequoia, Felicis, and Harpoon also participating. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/n8n-a-fair-code-workflow-automation-platform-raises-seed-from-sequoia-as-vc-firm-steps-up-in-europe/&quot;&gt;Sequoia led the seed round&lt;/a&gt; for n8n in 2020; &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/n8n-raises-12m-for-its-fair-code-approach-to-low-code-workflow-automation/&quot;&gt;Felicis the Series A&lt;/a&gt; in 2021.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The startup, founded in 2019, picked up traction in its early years from developer teams that were looking for low-code and no-code automation solutions to make it easier to stitch applications together in ways without a lot of onerous coding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;It picked up attention for another reason, too: n8n had built a reputation by being closely tied to the concept of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://faircode.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;fair code&lt;/a&gt;.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Fair code is a progression of &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/28/we-finally-have-an-official-definition-for-open-source-ai/&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;. Software developers use open source code for free, but when they want to commercialize work built on top of it, it establishes principles for compensating the open source creators or community. Jan Oberhauser, the founder and CEO of n8n, came up with the idea and runs a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://faircode.io/&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to fair code.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;But while n8n itself is built on fair code and leans into the open source community to grow by word of mouth — it has more than 70,000 &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/22/the-20-hottest-open-source-startups-of-2024/&quot;&gt;“stars” on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; — the company says that it was weaving in AI that became its rocket ship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;AI, and in particular generative AI, is a clear complement to automation — something that close competitors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tines.com/product/ai/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Tines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.workato.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Workato&lt;/a&gt; have also embraced, as have others in the wider automation world like &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/uipath-is-looking-for-a-path-to-growth-in-agentic-ai-with-its-peak-ai-acquisition/&quot;&gt;UiPath&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;If automation and low-code approaches have erased some of the busy work of pulling together how different apps or services worked together, generative AI brings even less technicality into the mix.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;A year and a half ago, Oberhauser said, “we could see this AI thing coming at us.” He quickly surmised that the sweet spot would be to work it into its products, to start to reduce the amount of work it took developers to implement automations by turning instructions into natural language.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;“It’s a prompt to build workflow,” is how Oberhauser describes it. “People don’t really need to write 50 lines of code to integrate the functionality of, say, sending an email.” Now in natural language, you can write “get information from X and send it to Y,” he said. “We see the value in making changes to that more easily.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The product was built with a blend of LLMs in mind, and the idea is that if end users are already building services using one LLM or another, it can be swapped in to work with n8n’s platform. And like a number of other developer-focused platforms, n8n has a fairly extensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.n8n.io/help-community/contributing/?_gl=1*27mu12*_gcl_au*MTA1NTAyODk5MS4xNzQyODM2MDM0*_ga*MjE0NDI3OTU1OC4xNzQyODM2MDM1*_ga_0SC4FF2FH9*MTc0MjgzNjAzNS4xLjEuMTc0MjgzNjExMS42MC4wLjA.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;contributor community&lt;/a&gt; that is active on platforms like GitHub, gets involved in forums to help other developers with their questions, and builds and uses workflow templates built by others (n8n also has pre-built a number of workflow templates).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Even with all the hype and hope around artificial intelligence and GenAI these days, the AI-powered version of n8n took a while to stick, with virtually no take-up at all at first. Then last year, there was a sudden a tipping point.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Why? Perhaps the weight of a couple of trends coming together. There was the burst of chatter around AI in coding, with companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/ai-coding-startup-poolside-raises-500m-from-ebay-nvidia-and-others/&quot;&gt;Poolside&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/29/github-copilot-competitor-codeium-raises-150m-at-a-1-25b-valuation/&quot;&gt;Codeium&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/29/generative-ai-coding-startup-magic-lands-320m-investment-from-eric-schmidt-atlassian-and-others/&quot;&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; all raising big money within months of each other. And then within end users themselves, the chant to figure out how to use AI also became louder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;But there is a lot of hype and talk out there, too, and so ultimately n8n’s ease of use and usefulness seems to be what has sealed the deal with users, but also investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;“Everyone is trying to leverage AI but struggling to find practical use cases,” David Blyghton, the general partner at Highland who led the round, told me over a phone call. “The design, scale, and throughput of n8n is what allows people to adopt it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Oberhauser admits that although “it took a while for the market to catch up,” now he says that around 75% of all of n8n’s customers are using the AI tools they have built.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot; class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arcade.ai/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Arcade&lt;/a&gt;, a generative AI marketplace for designing jewelry, is expanding its offerings to include home goods, starting with rugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The company on Monday also introduced a new feature called “Match My Room,” which allows users to upload a photo of their room so their design complements the existing colors and style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Alongside this expansion, Arcade announced its $25 million Series A funding round, bringing the total amount raised to $42 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Similar to Arcade’s jewelry design generator, the rug creation tool leverages Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. Users select the rug material and then enter a text prompt to describe the desired design. Once the design is generated, it’s then paired with a manufacturer, who will send the creator a free sample for approval before purchasing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Based on our testing, rugs start at around $400 for a 3×9 hand-tufted wool option, which is the most affordable material. Prices increase for higher-end materials such as cashmere, alpaca, and mohair. However, Arcade claims to offer more affordable options than luxury rug retailers that charge thousands of dollars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image aligncenter size-large&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Magic-Match-Gif-2.gif?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-2985263&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-element-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wp-block-image__credits&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;Arcade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The “Match My Room” feature allows users to upload a photo of their space. While the AI analyzes color matching, it can’t successfully replicate patterns from other decor items in the image, like pillows and blankets. Overall, though, it’s a useful tool for ensuring the rug’s color accents tie in with other furniture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;For users looking to create designs for pure enjoyment, Arcade offers “Dream Boards,” which function similarly to Pinterest boards, showcasing products with similar themes, such as Hollywood-inspired earrings. Users can also browse other Dream Boards and make purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Additionally, Arcade has a seller program, allowing people to earn a 5% commission for each sale of their product, an increase from the previous 2.5%. Users can earn even more by joining Arcade’s affiliate program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The company recently launched a new entrepreneur program aimed at helping content creators unlock higher commission rates. Major media outlets and influencers with over 25,000 followers are encouraged to sign up by &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:marketing@arcade.ai&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;emailing&lt;/a&gt; Arcade’s marketing team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Despite launching its beta jewelry offering only in September 2024, Arcade claims to have generated 650,000 jewelry designs. But the company didn’t disclose how many users are interested in purchasing these designs, nor has it revealed the commission earnings of sellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Arcade is spearheaded by Mariam Naficy, who previously founded cosmetics retailer Eve and design marketplace Minted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The Series A round was led by Laura Chau (Canaan Partners), with participation from Kirsten Green (Forerunner).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The new capital will be allocated toward hiring, platform development, and introducing new product categories like ceramics and pillows. Naficy has &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/27/arcade-a-new-ai-product-creation-platform-designed-this-necklace/&quot;&gt;previously mentioned to TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt; that additional categories may include apparel and leather goods. According to its website, chain belts are also next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Arcade previously raised $17 million from Ashton Kutcher (Sound Ventures), Offline Ventures, and Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn co-founder). Other investors include Inspired Capital, Torch Capital, and David Luan, CEO of Adept AI Labs and former vice president of engineering at OpenAI, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot; class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;U.S. Treasury officials have lifted sanctions on Tornado Cash, a crypto mixer that the U.S. government previously said was used to launder $7 billion worth of crypto stolen by North Korean hackers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0057&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;, the Treasury said it “exercised our discretion” to delist Tornado Cash following a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/legal/court-overturns-us-sanctions-against-cryptocurrency-mixer-tornado-cash-2024-11-27/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;legal battle&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Crypto mixers allow customers to conceal where their crypto came from, including tainted or illicit funds, by blending the funds with other crypto.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;In 2022, the Treasury &lt;a href=&quot;https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;accused the “notorious” Tornado Cash&lt;/a&gt; of laundering stolen crypto from hacks carried out by North Korea, whose goal is to steal crypto to fund its nuclear weapons program. In August 2023, the two founders of Tornado Cash were &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/two-founders-behind-russian-crypto-mixer-tornado-cash-charged-by-u-s-federal-courts/&quot;&gt;criminally charged&lt;/a&gt; in a New York federal court, accused of conspiracy to launder money and sanctions violations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The Treasury said following its delisting of Tornado Cash that it remains “deeply concerned” about the threat of crypto hacks from the North Korean regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot; class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Brooklyn-based electric vehicle charging infrastructure startup Revel on Monday launched its first fast-charging station in San Francisco, kicking off its plans to expand across the Bay Area over the next year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;“For years, Revel has operated the largest, fastest, and most reliable fast-charging network in New York City,” Frank Reig, co-founder and CEO of Revel, said in a statement. “Now we’re bringing our model to the number one EV market in North America.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The Bay Area has some of the highest rates of EV ownership in the country. In 2024, more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.energy.ca.gov/data-reports/energy-almanac/zero-emission-vehicle-and-infrastructure-statistics-collection/new-zev&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;35% of new vehicle sales&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco were electric, compared to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q4-2024-ev-sales/#:~:text=Overall%2C%20EV%20sales%20in%20the,from%207.8%25%20share%20in%202023.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;national average&lt;/a&gt; of around 8%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Revel’s first West Coast charging station is in the city’s Mission District, and it features 12 chargers with 320 kW capacity, built by EV charging company Kempower. Like Revel’s stations across New York City, these will be publicly accessible 24/7 to any make and model of EV.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;The company said it has plans to add more than 125 chargers to the urban centers of San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, and South Francisco over the next year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, who cut the ribbon at Revel’s opening Monday, said the new chargers will make it easier for residents to make the switch to EVs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Revel’s San Francisco launch comes a week after the startup opened &lt;a href=&quot;https://panynj.gov/port-authority/en/press-room/press-release-archives/2025-press-releases/port-authority-and-revel-open-new-electric-vehicle-charging-stat.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;24 new chargers&lt;/a&gt; at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, located within the airport’s for-hire vehicle hold lot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;Last month, Revel &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/10/revel-nabs-60m-in-new-york-state-funding-to-build-more-ev-chargers/&quot;&gt;secured a $60 million loan&lt;/a&gt; from New York’s clean energy investment fund NY Green Bank to more than triple its fast-charging network in the city. The company said it hopes to expand to 300 chargers in New York by the end of this year, including a 60-stall site in Maspeth, Queens and a 48-stall site outside of LaGuardia Airport.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-block-paragraph&quot;&gt;“Our mission at Revel is to bring reliable fast-charging to dense urban areas where EVs can have the biggest impact on quality of life, but where charging is hardest to come by,” Paul Suhey, co-founder and COO of Revel, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
