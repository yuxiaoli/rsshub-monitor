It&#39;s pathetic, so I will write mine as [unbiased] as I can (I will still write my opinions though).

This is a book written by [Stephenie Meyer] that has taken the hearts of teenage girls (and boys, possibly) everywhere across the country. I personally think it is very good, though some people think it isn&#39;t. I think that they think they can&#39;t like it because it&#39;s so popular and they don&#39;t want to be part of the crowd.

[Bella Swan] is a clumsy 17 year old that moves to the [rainy town] of [Forks], from Phoenix. She meets Edward Cullen, who appears to hate her, though he saves her from being crushed by a truck. Eventually, it turns out the he is a vampire and she smells better to him than anyone else in the world. For some strange reason, this means that he loves her, and she loves him right back. In the first book, another vampire, James, chases Bella [to Phoenix] and attempts to kill her. Edward saves her. They go to [the prom], even though Bella INSISTS that they don&#39;t.

Now this is my opinion. I&#39;m not saying you have to agree with it.
I don&#39;t like Bella because she HATES with a strong, strong passion: presents, dancing, parties, groups of people, good attention, boys liking her, money being spent on her, etc. etc. etc.
Edward, I also don&#39;t like because he hates Jacob so much, and has no real reason to. Jacob loves Bella too. Oooooh, what a crime.
No offense to [edward and bella] lovers.

*Jacob is not even close to being a main character in the first book, but after that, he is. In case you&#39;re confused why people talk about him, and you&#39;ve only read the first book.&lt;br&gt;   &lt;i&gt;The fight between [Team Edward] and [Team Jacob] from [the Twilight series] will never end.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;   by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/author.php?author=TOGEPI%20:)&quot;&gt;TOGEPI :)&lt;/a&gt; </description><link>https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Twilight</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://twilight.urbanup.com/4175744</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2009 02:21:33 GMT</pubDate><author>TOGEPI :)</author></item><item><title>Nortin</title><description>someone who [thinks] there cool but they are a [total] [geek]&lt;br&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&quot;hey! that [mark] [guy] is such a [nortin]&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;   by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/author.php?author=Brittany%20A%20C&quot;&gt;Brittany A C&lt;/a&gt; </description><link>https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Nortin</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://nortin.urbanup.com/3101895</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2008 16:30:10 GMT</pubDate><author>Brittany A C</author></item><item><title>guillao</title><description>Someone that believes [he/she] is [something] they are not.
