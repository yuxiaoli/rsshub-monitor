&lt;p&gt; The 20-year-old Frenchman won the final five games to claim a 7-6(11), 5-7, 6-2 triumph against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/players/frances-tiafoe/td51/overview&quot;&gt;Frances Tiafoe&lt;/a&gt; at the hard-court ATP Masters 1000. Fils, who let slip two match points in the second set, rallied from a break down at 1-2 in the decider by changing tactics to try and hit winners as soon as he could. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ‚ÄúIt was very tough. When I got into the third set, I was cramping and I couldn‚Äôt find the rhythm anymore,‚Äù explained Fils, who will play top seed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/players/alexander-zverev/z355/overview&quot;&gt;Alexander Zverev&lt;/a&gt; in the fourth round. ‚ÄúMy serve was tough and I couldn‚Äôt jump, so I tried to relax and play as fast as I could and hit as strong as I could. Somehow it worked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to work every day, that‚Äôs for sure. Maybe once or twice out of 10 it‚Äôs going to work, and today it worked. I‚Äôm very happy about it, but Frances is a hell of a champion. It‚Äôs the first time we have played, and I hope we are going to have many more great battles.‚Äù &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;An EPIC in the 305 ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ArthurFils1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ArthurFils1&lt;/a&gt; becomes the first Frenchman to reach the fourth round of both Indian Wells and Miami in the same season since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/players/jeremy-chardy/ca12/overview&quot;&gt;Jeremy Chardy&lt;/a&gt; in 2018!&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MiamiOpen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@MiamiOpen&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/MiamiOpen?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#MiamiOpen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/KCGMxGNf4n&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/KCGMxGNf4n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/atptour/status/1904300974836977712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 24, 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
&lt;p&gt; In a match that ebbed and flowed throughout, Fils saved six set points in the first set before claiming it 13/11 in the joint-longest tie-break of the 2025 season so far. He then missed his first two match points at 5-4 in the second set, before Tiafoe reeled off a three-game streak to send the pair‚Äôs maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head to a decider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The home favourite Tiafoe, who was aiming to secure back-to-back tour-level wins for the first time since he reached the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/tournaments/us-open/560/overview&quot;&gt;US Open&lt;/a&gt; semi-finals last September, appeared to have taken control of the third set with a break in the third game. Then came Fils‚Äô late barrage, however, during which the Frenchman notched three consecutive breaks of serve of his own with a series of searing blows off both wings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/news/it-all-adds-up-hub&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;It All Adds Up&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/-/media/2024-images/news/2025/01/07/03/30/it-all-adds-up-banner.jpg?w=100%25&amp;amp;hash=B020DA612BE0D0A67145854EF774A25A&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Fils converted four of 14 break points he earned in the two-hour, 55-minute encounter, according to Infosys ATP Stats. The Frenchman is now up two spots to No. 16 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, boosting his chances of setting a new career high after Miami, while he has now also reached the fourth round in his three most recent Masters 1000 events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ‚ÄúIt means a lot for sure,‚Äù said Fils, who has achieved that feat across Paris (last season), Indian Wells and Miami. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the first time at the Masters that I‚Äôve reached the fourth round twice [in a year]. In Indian Wells it was very good, and I was thinking that this week was going to be tough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ‚ÄúI was very focused to play the opening round against [Gabriel] Diallo. He got injured, and I‚Äôm sorry about it, and then today I found a way. Now we are in the fourth round, I‚Äôm going to play against the top seed, and let‚Äôs see how it goes.‚Äù &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top seed produced a clinical response to his error-strewn start to prevail 7-5, 6-4 against Australia‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/players/jordan-thompson/tc61/overview&quot;&gt;Jordan Thompson&lt;/a&gt; and reach the fourth round in Miami for the fifth time. Zverev rode a mid-match surge in form, during which he won eight of the next nine games from 1-4 in the first set, to improve to 3-2 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúJordan made it difficult for me for sure,‚Äù said Zverev, who is now 19-9 in Miami. ‚ÄúHe&#39;s a quality player. When you&#39;re in rhythm, he knows how to break [it] a little bit. So he did extremely well today. I&#39;m happy with my level from 1-4 onwards, losing just one game out of [the next] nine.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By sealing his 81st Masters 1000 win since the start of 2020, Zverev broke his tie with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/players/stefanos-tsitsipas/te51/overview&quot;&gt;Stefanos Tsitsipas&lt;/a&gt; for the most recorded by any player in that period. Since 2020, he has won four titles (Rome and Paris last year, Madrid and Cincinnati in 2021) and reached two further finals.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The No. 37 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Thompson reeled off the first three games to spark hopes of an upset at Hard Rock Stadium. Yet once Zverev had found his range, there was no way past. The World No. 2 executed a sublime drop volley in the 11th game before going on to break and let out a mighty roar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Zverev‚Äôs first serve was typically sound, winning 76 per cent (32/42) of points behind it, his second serve proved key. The 23-time tour-level titlist dropped just three of the 13 second-serve points for a winning percentage of 77, according to Infosys ATP Stats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Zverev, who fell in his Indian Wells opener to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/players/tallon-griekspoor/gj37/overview&quot;&gt;Tallon Griekspoor&lt;/a&gt;, his third-round win in Miami marks just the second time he has earned back-to-back tour-level victories since reaching his third major final at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/tournaments/australian-open/580/overview&quot;&gt;Australian Open&lt;/a&gt; in January. The 27-year-old reached the 2018 final in Miami, where he lost to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/players/john-isner/i186/overview&quot;&gt;John Isner&lt;/a&gt;, and will next continue his campaign against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/players/arthur-fils/f0f1/overview&quot;&gt;Arthur Fils&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/news/fils-tiafoe-miami-2025-monday&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Frenchman overcame cramping in the deciding set to defeat Frances Tiafoe&lt;/a&gt; 7-6(11), 5-7, 6-2 in a thrilling third-round clash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third-seeded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/players/taylor-fritz/fb98/overview&quot;&gt;Taylor Fritz&lt;/a&gt; avenged his recent Dallas loss to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/players/denis-shapovalov/su55/overview&quot;&gt;Denis Shapovalov&lt;/a&gt; by prevailing 7-5, 6-3 to seal his fourth-round spot in Miami. The American No. 1 let slip a 5-2 lead in the first set, but regained control with some imperious serving to motor to an 86-minute victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIf we went through that match 10 times, I feel like I would win it more times than I would lose it,‚Äù Fritz said of their recent meeting in Dallas. ‚ÄúIn that match he served really well. Today, I probably returned a little bit better, but I got more help from him as well. He threw in some double [faults] and overall I played well.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/tournaments/australian-open/580/overview&quot;&gt;Australian Open&lt;/a&gt;, Fritz has dealt with an abdominal injury, which forced him to withdraw from the ATP 500 in Acapulco. Yet, with back-to-back fourth-round runs in Indian Wells and Miami, Fritz seems to be gathering welcome momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 10-minute delay to assist a courtside fan in need of medical assistance appeared to shift the momentum with Shapovalov serving at 2-5. The Canadian No. 2 conjured some inspired shot-making to level at 5-5, but his hard work unravelled in a shaky 12th game: Shapovalov surrendered his serve to love with back-to-back double faults before Fritz hit a left-handed forehand en route to clinching his only set point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fritz continued to pile on the pressure to Shapovalov, who won just 62 per cent (23/37) of his first-serve points. In contrast, Fritz was ruthless on serve throughout the second set, during which he did not drop a point behind his 17 first deliveries en route to improving to 5-6 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head with Shapovalov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the first Top-3 seeded American in Miami since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/players/andy-roddick/r485/overview&quot;&gt;Andy Roddick&lt;/a&gt; in 2007, Fritz will next face Australia‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/players/adam-walton/w09e/overview&quot;&gt;Adam Walton&lt;/a&gt;, who overcame Hong Kong‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/players/coleman-wong/w0bh/overview&quot;&gt;Coleman Wong&lt;/a&gt; 7-6(6), 4-6, 6-4 to become the fourth lucky loser to reach the Miami fourth round in tournament history.&lt;/p&gt;

His team, including physio Emilio Poveda, can attest to that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ‚ÄúIn the last preseason, on court in Monaco, his coach Adolfo [Gutierrez] ran a 30-metre sprint against him. Not to try and beat him, because that‚Äôs impossible, but just to give Alex something to think about,‚Äù remembers Poveda, physio and physical education graduate from the University of Valencia. ‚ÄúAdolfo pulled his hamstring. It wasn‚Äôt serious, but it took him a few weeks to recover.‚Äù &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Poveda has also had first-hand experience of trying to keep pace with De Minaur. Even though the physio keeps himself fit all year, and despite having trained more intensely purely so he could give Alex some company as he does his exercises, Poveda ended up in the sick bay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ‚ÄúNow we have a second fitness coach on the team, Fran, a friend of mine. We tag each other in to join Alex. When we do series, for example, one person runs one part, and the other one does the next. Alex still beats us,‚Äù added Poveda. ‚ÄúThe other day I did series of 400 with him and I didn‚Äôt feel well the next day. I was sick for a week. He‚Äôs injuring all of us!‚Äù &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.atptour.com/en/players/alex-de-minaur/dh58/overview&#39;&gt;Alex de Minaur&lt;/a&gt;/Emilio Poveda&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/-/media/2024-images/news/2017-photo-upload/de-minaur-poveda-2025-miami.jpg&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The No. 11 in the PIF ATP Rankings, De Minaur is one of the fittest players to have competed on the ATP Tour in recent times. He is extraordinarily fast, resistant and explosive, can jump the same height with both legs, and recovers extremely quickly after a shot, a rally, a match, or a weeks-long swing of the Tour... the list goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; What does this look like on paper? In a speed and agility test called the T-Test, De Minaur‚Äôs numbers do not even compare with most of his peers. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 10 metres forwards, five metres from one side to the other,‚Äù explained Poveda. ‚ÄúAlex is under 10 seconds, almost nine. So far, we‚Äôre yet to find another player who comes near our numbers.‚Äù &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Much of that excellence is innate. But most of it is due to the hard work and dedication of the 10th seed at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/tournaments/miami/403/overview&quot;&gt;Miami Open presented by Itau&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ‚ÄúFitness training has been very important in my career, above all in the last four or five years. It‚Äôs a lot of work that I do almost every day of my life,‚Äù said De Minaur. ‚ÄúThe work never stops and that‚Äôs the only way to improve. You don‚Äôt only get better by improving your technique on the practice court.‚Äù &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; display: block; max-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-top: 56.25%;&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://players.brightcove.net/6057277721001/8gZSNwgH_default/index.html?videoId=6370252738112&quot; allow=&quot;encrypted-media&quot; style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Even on days when he is not in the mood and his body is asking for a break, the 26-year-old right-hander always finds a way to achieve his goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ‚ÄúWhen he‚Äôs struggling with it, he still performs. I remember two years ago he was going hell for leather, and he was feeling dizzy,‚Äù recalled Poveda. ‚ÄúI joked ‚ÄòAlex, you‚Äôre too delicate‚Äô. But he managed to continue easily. He‚Äôs able to suffer in training because he doesn‚Äôt want to on court. That‚Äôs why he says he‚Äôs never as out of breath during points as he is when we do intense anaerobic exercises.‚Äù &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The determination that prevents De Minaur from throwing in the towel when things are tough has helped him to improve the very physical attributes that made him vulnerable in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ‚ÄúWhen I joined the Tour, I only weighed 67, 68 kilos. Obviously, that wasn‚Äôt sustainable if I was to reach the top,‚Äù said De Minaur, who now weighs in at almost 76 kilograms. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I had to get stronger, while also trying not to lose the consistency and speed or even the engine to play long matches.‚Äù &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Today, the Australian still does not appear as muscular as some of his peers, but that only makes the power he is capable of unleashing all the more astonishing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ‚ÄúI‚Äôve taken some of my pupils to train with Alex, but they can‚Äôt match his numbers,‚Äù said Poveda. ‚ÄúThere is an exercise he does lying face down and you have to push up with the knee bent, and you measure it with a dynamometer. It‚Äôs very difficult to generate a lot of force with your gluteus maximus. Alex has managed 90 kilos. It‚Äôs so hard to do that.‚Äù &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; His superior fitness will be vital as he takes on his next opponent, fast-rising #NextGenATP Brazilian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/players/joao-fonseca/f0fv/overview&quot;&gt;Joao Fonseca&lt;/a&gt;, in the third round at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/tournaments/miami/403/overview&quot;&gt;Miami Open presented by Itau&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very fit now, very happy with how my body is. Obviously, the plan is to have a physical battle, right?‚Äù said Alex of his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with the 18-year-old Fonseca. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see how the match goes. He‚Äôll be dangerous, but I can‚Äôt wait to play against him.‚Äù &lt;/p&gt;

That remains one of the biggest victories of the Australian‚Äôs career, but it is not what he thinks about when pondering their Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry before their meeting on Monday in the third round of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/tournaments/miami/403/overview&quot;&gt;Miami Open presented by Itau&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äú[I] kind of look back at the last one, when he chopped me one and one. Wasn&#39;t my best day at the office, and he had a good day,‚Äù Thompson said. ‚ÄúBut I think we&#39;ve played each other four times. Two of them have been six in the third, one has been straightforward the other way, and one was more straightforward than the other. But I hope I played better than the last time we played.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That most recent clash came last August in Montreal, where Zverev won 59 per cent of his return points according to Infosys ATP Stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/tournaments/australian-open/580/overview&quot;&gt;Australian Open&lt;/a&gt; finalist, Grand Slam finalist. You could go on all day about what a great player Sascha is,‚Äù the Australian said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; display: block; max-width: 100%;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-top: 56.25%;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thompson is a formidable foe, which is why he was able to defeat Zverev, now the No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, twice. Last November the 30-year-old reached a career-high World No. 26. How will he approach the showdown?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWith a great mental attitude. As I said, last time I copped a whooping, so I want to make sure that doesn&#39;t happen again,‚Äù Thompson said. ‚ÄúBut sometimes, when he catches fire, there&#39;s nothing really you can do. He&#39;s got a great, great serve. Doesn&#39;t miss many groundies, moves well, great returner, so my work&#39;s cut out for me.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/en/news/it-all-adds-up-hub&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;It All Adds Up&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.atptour.com/-/media/2024-images/news/2025/01/07/03/30/it-all-adds-up-banner.jpg?w=100%25&amp;amp;hash=B020DA612BE0D0A67145854EF774A25A&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is safe to say Thompson will be ready to compete. Whether on or off the court, the World No. 37 enjoys a good battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúDoesn&#39;t matter what I&#39;m doing, I want to win, whether I&#39;ll be playing marbles, FIFA, Smash Brothers, Mario Kart, game of cards,‚Äù Thompson said. ‚ÄúI want to win everything, so I&#39;m always, always competing.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
