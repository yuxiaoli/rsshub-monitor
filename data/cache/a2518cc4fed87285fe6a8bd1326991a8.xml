However, on Oct. 16, 2024, the Taiwan High Court approved its removal on the condition that he paid an additional NT$20 million on top of the original NT$50 million bail and continued reporting to a designated police station as required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Taipei District Prosecutors Office said it will reassess whether existing measures are effective in preventing suspects from jumping bail and report on improvements to the Supreme Prosecutors Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taipei prosecutors have formed a task force in line with a directive from the Supreme Prosecutors Office, working alongside the Investigation Bureau, Criminal Investigation Bureau, and Taipei City Police Department to pursue and apprehend Chung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Taipei prosecutors office has also alerted the Immigration Agency and the Coast Guard Administration and requested their assistance, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chung was first found guilty of manipulating depositary receipts to make illicit gains exceeding NT$441.32 million in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chung posted NT$50 million bail in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 12, the Supreme Court convicted him of seven crimes, sentencing him to 30 years and five months in prison, with a maximum term capped at 30 years. The convictions include five violations of the Securities and Exchange Act, with individual sentences ranging from 39 to 118 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Taiwan High Court on March 13 defended its decision made in October 2024 to remove Chung&#39;s electronic monitoring device, saying that Chung had consistently reported as required from 2023 to 2024, and it believed the additional bail would deter him from fleeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to local media outlet Mirror Media, Chung is reportedly hiding in northern Taiwan while waiting for an opportunity to flee the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;

(TSMC), the world&#39;s top contract chipmaker, to pledge an additional US$100 billion over the next few years to expand its semiconductor manufacturing operations in the U.S., Amari said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet even then, U.S. self-sufficiency is still &quot;impossible. Allied and like-minded countries should concentrate on their strengths to build a complete supply chain rather than putting everything in America,&quot; Amari said based on a translation of his speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan, Taiwan, the Netherlands, Belgium and even South Korea are strong in manufacturing, and ASEAN countries are known for producing high qualify semiconductor components, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We need to combine the strengths of countries around the world,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the success of TSMC relies heavily on its talented engineers at all levels of the organization, he argued, according to the translation, saying that the high yield rate at TSMC&#39;s first fab in Arizona was because most of the 1,300 workers were Taiwanese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That talent was critical to a strong chip industry, Amari said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet he believed that the U.S. would eventually insist that TSMC use American workers, which would be a problem because American workers are extremely protective of their labor rights and take little initiative to do their jobs better, he contended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One other factor, Amari said, was that to prevent the leak of confidential information into the wrong hands, allied countries have to group together rather than go it alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amari was the leader of Japan&#39;s parliamentary caucus for the strategic promotion of the semiconductor industry until late 2024. He was also behind Japan&#39;s decision to invite TSMC to open a wafer fab -- Japan&#39;s most advanced microchip facility -- in Kumamoto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2025 Yushan Forum is being held under the theme of &quot;New Southbound Policy+: Taiwan, the Indo-Pacific, and a New World&quot; from Monday to Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual forum aims to include more like-minded partners in discussions on how Taiwan is taking advantage of smart, digital and innovative solutions to promote the so-called &quot;Digital New Southbound Policy,&quot; according to organizers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;

On Sunday, the Palau president accompanied Shih and the delegation to survey the country&#39;s marine tourism industry, the foundation added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shih and Whipps also signed a memorandum of understanding on economic cooperation by taking advantage of Taiwan&#39;s successful business model to help Palau and start to push for a series of joint economic developments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the foundation, Whipps also said he hoped Shih would employ his experiences in building a successful business to help enhance the country&#39;s economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cited by the foundation, Shih said as Palau is a diplomatic ally of Taiwan, the private business sector should embrace efforts by Taiwan government to boost the prosperity of its allies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an island of technology as well as a silicon island, in particular, Taiwan is able to take advantage of its achievements in developing high tech industries and running a tech ecosystem to advance the industrial development of its allies, Shih said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Acer founder said Taiwan and Palau have been discussing economic cooperation in a wide range of areas such as medical care through the integration of Palau&#39;s traditional medicine achievements and Chinese medicine research teams from Taiwan&#39;s public and private sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the tourism industry, Shih said, Palau and Taiwan&#39;s Lion Travel Service Co. are discussing a plan to launch a premium tourism program on its Peleliu island, while Palau&#39;s 77-foot zero-carbon vessel, Porrima 77, is planning to enter the upscale diving and ecotourism by working with a Japanese partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whipps is scheduled to come to Taiwan in May and during his stay, the Palau president will visit Kaohsiung, where the Porrima P111 vessel is being upgraded.

This kind of changed mindset has been needed in Europe for some time,&quot; said the Danish politician who also served as NATO secretary general from August 2009 to October 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the most immediate threat to Europe is Russia, Rasmussen warned that &quot;dictators are looking at what happens in Ukraine and drawing their own lessons.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the former Danish prime minister, the U.S.&#39; &quot;hard pivot away&quot; from Europe is &quot;driven by a focus on power competition in the Pacific,&quot; as &quot;China is the existential threat to American hegemony.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If the United States is vacating its role as champion of freedom and democracy, Europe&#39;s friendship with Taiwan must now enter a new golden era.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen said that Europe must strengthen its economic and trading relations with Taiwan by building on the European Union&#39;s Chips Act &quot;to significantly expand our tech diplomacy and cooperation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Above all, Europe must stand with Taiwan -- economically, politically, even militarily. Not just because of some short-term interests but because, in a dangerous and unpredictable world, freedom fighters stand together,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen made the remarks during a luncheon on the first day of the two-day Yushan Forum, which opened in Taipei on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, during the same luncheon, Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim (蕭美琴) said Taiwan is striving to ensure it remains &quot;irreplaceable and indispensable as a trusted economic and trade partner to the world&quot; against the backdrop of an &quot;unprecedented&quot; geopolitical and economic landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan takes its promise to uphold geopolitical stability seriously, Hsiao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;At the same time, Taiwan is much more than a geopolitical headline. We have a lot to offer the world. And the world can benefit from having a strong Taiwan,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2025 Yushan Forum is being held under the theme of &quot;New Southbound Policy+: Taiwan, the Indo-Pacific, and a New World.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual forum aims to include more like-minded partners in discussions on how Taiwan is taking advantage of smart, digital and innovative, solutions to promote the so-called &quot;Digital New Southbound Policy,&quot; according to organizers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;

Taiwan will continue to engage with the world and we welcome the world to come closer to Taiwan,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yushan Forum, jointly hosted by Taiwan&#39;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Taiwan-Asia Exchange Foundation, aims to deepen Taiwan&#39;s partnerships with countries in Asia and beyond by fostering regional dialogue, expanding multilateral opportunities for cooperation, and facilitating exchanges of ideas among talent in technology and social initiatives, according to the event&#39;s website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Monday&#39;s event, foreign dignitaries emphasized the importance of Taiwan Strait security for both the global economy and international stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Institute in Taiwan Director Raymond Greene said that every country has a stake in preserving peace in the Taiwan Strait, and the United States is no different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, Greene said, &quot;has underscored that we have an abiding interest in peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of peace and stability in the international community.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservative estimates have put the cost of a conflict in the Taiwan Strait at over 10 percent of global GDP -- greater than World War II, Greene noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Together with our closest international partners, we will reinforce our opposition to any attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force of coercion,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his remarks, Japanese lawmaker Keiji Furuya, who chairs the 270-member Japan-ROC Diet Members&#39; Consultative Council, said &quot;A Taiwan emergency is a Japan emergency,&quot; quoting the late former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In order to protect a free and open Indo-Pacific, we will continue to check China and safeguard peace in the Taiwan Strait with like-minded countries,&quot; Furuya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;

Later, the Chinese shuttler took advantage of Lee&#39;s unforced errors to win the match and secure his second All England Open title since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee said he lost consecutive points in the second game because &quot;even the slightest deviation in my strategy turned into unforced errors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;media&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;soundcloudMedia&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;448&quot; style=&quot;border:none;overflow:hidden&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=448&amp;amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbwfbadminton%2Fvideos%2F3022310534599496%2F&amp;amp;show_text=false&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;t=0&quot; sandbox=&quot;allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-modals allow-top-navigation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation allow-downloads allow-orientation-lock allow-pointer-lock allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-presentation allow-top-navigation-to-custom-protocols&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee&#39;s strong showing in England came following a lengthy slump. After reaching the semifinals of the 2024 Taipei Open in early September, he had won only two matches in the nine tournaments he played in through the end of January 2025, which he said weighed heavily on him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But I later changed my mindset and was able to manage myself better,&quot; he said. &quot;That allowed me to perform well in France and at the All England Open.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The silver medal on Sunday was Lee&#39;s best career performance, an achievement that he said was unexpected and a symbol of his ability to overcome his personal challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His coach Feng Sheng-chieh (馮勝杰) praised him for gaining the runner-up title but said there was still room for improvement, particularly regarding the unforced errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Lee&#39;s father said he hopes his son can work his way up in the world rankings this year to between 10th and 15th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;

General Assembly Resolution 2758 is &quot;unreasonable and unacceptable,&quot; MOFA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resolution 2758, adopted in 1971, resulted in the People&#39;s Republic of China (PRC) replacing the ROC as China&#39;s representative at the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;

Therefore, offering a variety of titles is key to discovering fresh and interesting stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said that Taiwanese comics stand out from Japanese works because they originate from a &quot;hybrid culture&quot; influenced by Dutch, Chinese, and Japanese elements, making them particularly fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;

(TWC) is considering a water price hike to counter mounting financial losses, and plans to submit a pricing review report to the Ministry of Economic Affairs by the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an advanced copy of the report seen by CNA Sunday, the state-run utility said it aims to secure financial support or adjust pricing while minimizing the impact on residential users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TWC currently incurs a loss of NT$2.45 (US$0.07) per cubic meter of water sold, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan&#39;s water rates have remained unchanged for 31 years. The current pricing structure has four tiers: NT$7.35 per cubic meter for up to 10 cubic meters of water, NT$9.45 for 11 to 30 cubic meters, NT$11.55 for 31 to 50 cubic meters, and NT$12.075 for any consumption exceeding 50 cubic meters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TWC&#39;s preliminary proposal suggests keeping the first-tier rate unchanged, applying moderate increases to the second and third tiers, and introducing larger hikes with additional brackets for the fourth tier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial estimates indicate that at least 60 percent of consumers would not be affected, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final decision on any changes will be made by the Executive Yuan, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, TWC posted a post-tax loss of NT$3.94 billion, with losses expected to grow to NT$5.93 billion in 2025. The company cited rising costs, including depreciation, interest payments, and ongoing efforts to reduce water leakage, as key financial pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2025, Premier Cho Jung-tai (卓榮泰) urged the public to accept &quot;fair&quot; water pricing, while Economics Minister Kuo Jyh-huei (郭智輝) instructed TWC to submit its pricing adjustment review by the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An additional initiative under consideration is a water quality-based pricing model, which would introduce premium pricing for higher-quality drinking water, creating an additional revenue stream for TWC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal involves installing water purification equipment at the consumer level, allowing households and businesses that currently use private filtration systems to access certified purification services directly from TWC, sources familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TWC&#39;s in-house water quality testing capabilities would ensure compliance with drinking water standards, the sources said, adding that however, the feasibility of the system and its impact on the overall water distribution network require further evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;

The impact will depend on rainfall and pollutant accumulation, with central and southern Taiwan more susceptible to fluctuations in air quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent meteorologist Wu Der-rong (吳德榮) said high-pressure systems will dominate Taiwan&#39;s weather from March 17 to 20, bringing clear skies and stable conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temperatures are expected to gradually rise between March 21 and 25, though early morning lows in some areas may still dip below 10 degrees, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to strong northeasterly winds causing rough seas, ferry operators have canceled services between Taitung City and Green Island for Sunday afternoon and all day on March 17. Sailings between Taitung City and Orchid Island have also been canceled for the entire day on March 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;

She added that the party does not rule out holding additional sessions if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A KMT source said the party was forced to take action due to the DPP&#39;s reluctance to negotiate with opposition lawmakers. The upcoming sessions will focus on the KMT&#39;s efforts to improve people&#39;s livelihoods rather than &quot;dance to the DPP&#39;s tune.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;

(TRC) Chairperson Du Wei (杜微) has tendered his resignation, citing plans for his personal career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry said it tried to persuade Du to reconsider his resignation but he was insistent, saying that he had other &quot;personal career plans.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pending the Cabinet&#39;s approval of Du&#39;s resignation, he will be replaced by Deputy Transportation Minister Wu Sheng-yuan (伍勝園), who will serve as acting chairperson of TRC, the ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Du, 65, responded to CNA&#39;s inquiry that he had served at Taiwan Railway for 40 years and was ready to spend more time with his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He started as an intern at Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA), when it was a government agency, and was its last director-general. When TRA was corporatized in January 2024, Du was appointed chairperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly before TRA&#39;s corporatization, Du said in an interview with CNA that under his leadership, the company could shed its short-term debts by 2026 and move to profit by 2028.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, TRC suffered record losses of NT$13.8 billion (US$419.22 million) in 2024, while its on-time performance rate was 93.5 percent, falling short of the expected 97 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, Du attributed those problems to natural disasters and the company&#39;s efforts to comply with government policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, while confirming recent rumors of Du&#39;s resignation, the MOTC gave him credit for the move to adjust Taiwan Railway fares, which was approved by the TRC board and an MOTC committee in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal to increase Taiwan Railway fares after 30 years of stagnation has been sent to the Cabinet for approval, the ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;

(TSMC) cemented the lead over its peers in the global pure-play wafer foundry market by taking a market share of more than 67 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, leaving its competitors far behind, according to Taipei-based informational market advisory firm TrendForce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TrendForce said TSMC commanded a 67.1 percent share in the global market during the October-December 2024 period, up from 64.7 percent seen in a quarter earlier after the contract chipmaker generated US$26.85 billion in sales in the fourth quarter, up 14.1 percent from the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advisory firm said TSMC benefited from strong shipment growth of smartphones and artificial intelligence applications to further strengthen its leadership in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advisory added that with the global foundry business increasingly polarized, chipmakers like TSMC, which specializes in high-end IC production, rode the waves of emerging technologies including AI and high-performance computing devices. On the other hand, manufacturers rolling out chips made on mature products remained bogged down by a supply glut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TSMC&#39;s growing market share left Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea further behind as the Korean chipmaker took an 8.1 percent market share in the fourth quarter, down from 9.1 percent in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samsung&#39;s sales in the fourth quarter fell 1.4 percent from a quarter earlier to US$3.26 billion as its sales from new advanced-node customers failed to fully compensate for the loss of orders from its major existing clients, TrendForce said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China&#39;s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC) came in third with a 5.5 percent share of the market in the fourth quarter, ahead of United Microelectronics Corp. of Taiwan with a 4.7 percent share, and U.S.-based GlobalFoundries Inc. with a 4.6 percent share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huahong Group from China took the sixth place, with a 2.6 percent market share, followed by Israel&#39;s Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (1.0 percent), Taiwan&#39;s Vanguard International Semiconductor Corp. (VIS) (0.9 percent), China&#39;s NexChip Co. (0.9 percent) and Taiwan&#39;s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (PSMC) (0.8 percent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TrendForce said the top 10 contract chipmakers posted US$38.48 billion in sales in the fourth quarter, up almost 10 percent from a quarter earlier, accounting for about 96 percent of the global total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;

Without strong winds to disperse pollutants, airborne particles accumulate, leading to worsening air quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to recent air pollution incidents, the ministry coordinated with local and central government agencies to reduce emissions from major power plants, including those in Keelung, Taichung, Yunlin and Kaohsiung, resulting in a combined reduction equivalent to 66 days&#39; worth of electricity use in New Taipei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For long-term improvements, the government is collaborating with experts to integrate global best practices into Taiwan&#39;s air quality strategy, while the upcoming white paper on air quality policy will outline further regulatory and technological initiatives, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;
