prequalifies first maternal respiratory syncytial virus vaccine</title><description>&lt;p&gt;On 12 March 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://extranet.who.int/prequal/vaccines/p/abrysvo/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;first maternal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine&lt;/a&gt; to protect infants against one of the most common causes of acute lower respiratory infections in children globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year, RSV causes more than 3.6 million hospitalizations and about 100&amp;nbsp;000 deaths in children under 5 years of age. About half of these deaths occur in infants younger than 6 months of age. The majority of paediatric RSV deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries where there is limited access to supportive medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no specific treatments for RSV infection, making supportive measures the main line of therapy. Preventive measures, such as vaccines, are key to reducing cases of pneumonia and bronchiolitis, decreasing hospitalizations and oxygen use, and saving infant lives globally. After decades of research, there are currently two licensed immunization products for prevention of RSV disease in young infants: the maternal vaccine given to pregnant women in the third trimester to protect their babies and a long-acting monoclonal antibody administered to infants from birth just before or during the RSV season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"RSV has long been an under-recognized public health problem, significantly impacting infants worldwide,” says Dr Katherine O’Brien, WHO Director, Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. “Expanding access to maternal RSV vaccination will help keep infants out of hospitals, save lives and free up limited resources for other health priorities.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2024, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) made global recommendations&amp;nbsp;to introduce passive immunization (maternal vaccination and infant monoclonal antibodies) for the prevention of severe RSV disease in young infants. The subsequent prequalification of the maternal RSV vaccine in March 2025 reflects the Organization’s commitment to improving health equity by expediting access to life-saving health products in parallel to developing recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prequalified maternal vaccine, ABRYSVO®, aims to prevent RSV-associated disease in infants during the first 6 months through the transfer of antibodies during gestation. ABRYSVO® is manufactured by Pfizer with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as the Regulatory Authority of reference. To date, the maternal RSV vaccine has only been used in high- and middle-income countries. With prequalification and new WHO recommendations, the aim is to expand RSV vaccination to low- and lower-middle-income countries where the risk of severe disease and death is highest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO will launch a position paper on RSV vaccines in May 2025 based on the SAGE recommendations. The aim of the position paper is to inform national public health officials and immunization programme managers on use of RSV immunization products in their national programmes, as well as national and international funding agencies.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prequalification is a pre-requisite for financial support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and for vaccine purchases by UN agencies such as UNICEF. The Gavi Board will make further decisions about the inclusion the maternal RSV vaccine within the Organization’s vaccine portfolio during 2025.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;color:inherit;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;----&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://confirmsubscription.com/h/d/4BC833B1BCA2AAC0/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe to the Global Immunization Newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//19-03-2025-who-prequalifies-first-maternal-respiratory-syncytial-virus-vaccine</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//19-03-2025-who-prequalifies-first-maternal-respiratory-syncytial-virus-vaccine</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:23:32 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>New Health Investment Platform to improve primary health care convenes its first Steering Committee</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/about/collaboration/health-impact-investment-platform/%22"&gt;Health Impact Investment Platform (HIIP)&lt;/a&gt; held its inaugural Steering Committee meeting, marking a significant milestone in advancing innovative financing for global health. As the Platform’s highest decision-making body, the Committee – consisting of representatives from the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Investment Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank – reviewed progress, endorsed key governance and operational priorities, and provided strategic guidance on HIIP’s efforts to expand primary health care (PHC) services in low- and middle-income countries. The meeting represents a significant step forward in advancing sustainable financing solutions for global health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HIIP was unveiled during the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.climate-chance.org/en/event-calendar/summit-financial-pact-international-aid-fund/#:~:text=From%20June%2022%20to%2023,during%20the%20COP27%20in%20Egypt.\%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Summit for a New Global Financing Pact&lt;/a&gt; in Paris in 2023, and is a landmark partnership between WHO, multilateral development banks and beneficiary countries. Amid a US$&amp;nbsp;371&amp;nbsp;billion annual health financing gap for health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and a US$&amp;nbsp;31.1&amp;nbsp;billion annual funding requirement for pandemic preparedness, the Platform innovates multilateral solutions to increase the share of development funding going to the health sector. Integrating technical expertise, financial resources and local knowledge into impactful, country-driven investments in vulnerable communities, the Platform has mobilized over US$&amp;nbsp;30&amp;nbsp;million of investment for WHO to support countries in developing prioritized investment plans for potential support from MDBs and donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Platform aims to use these plans to generate over US$1.5 billion funding for low- and middle-income country governments to build resilience against pandemic threats and the climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Primary health care is the cornerstone of equitable, cost-effective, and inclusive health systems,” said Catharina Boehme, Assistant Director-General at the World Health Organization. “The Health Impact Investment Platform is a transformative initiative to mobilize financing for climate-adaptive and crisis-resilient primary health care in the countries that need it most. WHO is proud to partner with multilateral development banks and countries to ensure these funds deliver tangible impact for the communities we serve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The First Steering Committee builds on months of progress since the Platform’s official launch in September 2024, with early-stage engagements in more than 10 countries. During the meeting, Committee members approved key operational documents for the platform, reviewed Concept Notes developed to operationalize primary health care investments in Burundi, The Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Kazakhstan, Maldives, Morocco and Zambia and formally approved the Proposal for Action in Ethiopia, unlocking funding to support the finalization of its national PHC investment plan. Members reinforced the platform’s core focus on scaling primary health care investments, accelerating progress toward universal health coverage, and strengthening health system resilience in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issa Faye, Director General of Global Practice and Partnerships&amp;nbsp;at the Islamic Development Bank noted, “We are committed to catalyzing impactful, sustainable investments that strengthen health systems in low- and middle-income countries. Today’s discussions reaffirmed our shared vision and commitment to scaling up investment in primary health care, ensuring that no country is left behind in achieving universal health coverage and pandemic preparedness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next Steering Committee meeting will convene on the margins of the Seventy-Eighth World Health Assembly (19–27 May 2025), where progress on Ethiopia’s investment plan and new country engagements will be reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Östros, Vice President at the European Investment Bank and the newly appointed Chair of the Steering Committee emphasized, “The Health Impact Investment Platform is a unique opportunity to bridge the health financing gap and drive sustainable investments where they are most needed. As we look ahead to the next Steering Committee, our focus remains on turning commitments into action. We call on all stakeholders to join us in expanding access to quality primary health care, ensuring that investments today translate into stronger, more resilient health systems for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the HIIP will deepen engagements with the first wave of applicants and expand support to other interested countries. Eligible countries for the HIIP include low- and middle-income countries which are a country of operation for at least one of the partner Multilateral Development Banks.

Fourteen (14) of the 16 Committee Members, and one of the two Advisors to the Committee participated in the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), the Deputy Director-General  welcomed Members of and Advisors to the Committee, as well as Government Officials designated to present their views to the Committee on behalf of the ten invited States Parties – Burundi, Canada, China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Nepal, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Uganda, United Arab Emirates and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (United Kingdom).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his opening remarks, the WHO Deputy Director-General recalled that, on 14 August 2024, the upsurge of mpox was determined to constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). He noted that, over the three years from 1 January 2022 through 31 January 2025, almost 130&amp;nbsp;000 confirmed cases of mpox, including over 280 deaths, were reported to WHO from 130 countries and territories in all six WHO Regions, including seven countries and territories that had reported their first mpox cases since the previous meeting of the Committee on 22 November 2024. The WHO African Region, where some States Parties are continuing to experience sustained community transmission, accounts for 61% of the cases and 72% of the deaths reported globally over the past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO Deputy Director-General highlighted that, since the last meeting of the Committee, the epidemiological situation continues to be volatile. Despite observed improvements pertaining to several aspects of the response – emergency coordination, surveillance, laboratory diagnostics, empowerment of communities, furthering equitable access to medical countermeasures and tools – several critical challenges had emerged, including: (a) rising geopolitical instability in the DRC due to escalating conflict affecting mpox response operations resulting in temporary pauses in operation, relocation of staff and restricted access to affected populations; (b) concurrent health emergencies  requiring States Parties and partners to respond (e.g. Sudan virus disease outbreak in Uganda); and (c) uncertainties related to the pause in financial support from the United States of America (United States) occurring in the broader landscape of declining foreign assistance. To date, globally, one-third of the funds supporting the response to mpox had been pledged by the United States. Without sufficient funds, the ability of States Parties, WHO and partners to maintain, sustain, and expand the response to mpox would be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Representative of the Office of Legal Counsel then briefed the Members and Advisors on their roles and responsibilities and identified the mandate of the Committee under the relevant articles of the IHR. The Ethics Officer from the Department of Compliance, Risk Management, and Ethics provided the Members and Advisors with an overview of the WHO Declaration of Interests process. The Members and Advisors were made aware of their individual responsibility to disclose to WHO, in a timely manner, any interests of a personal, professional, financial, intellectual or commercial nature that may give rise to a perceived or actual conflict of interest. They were additionally reminded of their duty to maintain the confidentiality of the meeting discussions and the work of the Committee. Each Member and Advisor was surveyed, with no conflicts of interest identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meeting was handed over to the Chair who introduced the objectives of the meeting, which were to provide views to the WHO Director-General on whether the event continues to constitute a PHEIC, and if so, to provide views on the potential proposed temporary recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Session open to representatives of States Parties invited to present their views&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO Secretariat presented an overview of the global epidemiological situation of mpox, including all circulating clades of monkeypox virus (MPXV). Outside the WHO African Region, cases of mpox reported to WHO are associated with the spread of MPXV clade IIb, with a decline in the number of cases reported in recent months. In the WHO African Region, amid the circulation of multiple MPXV clades, the still growing number of cases reported monthly is driven by the spread of MPXV clade Ib. Since the Committee last met, on 22 November 2024, exported travel-related cases of confirmed MPXV clade Ib infection have been detected in eight additional countries outside the WHO African Region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO Secretariat then focused on the three countries reporting most cases of MPXV clade Ib since January 2024 – the DRC (over 15&amp;nbsp;000 cases, including cases in areas where MPXV clade Ia is circulating); Burundi (over 3000 cases, with a sustained decrease reported weekly and a geographic shift to the administrative capital Gitega since the Committee last met); and Uganda (nearly 3000 cases, with an exponential increase in and around the capital Kampala since the Committee last met). Notwithstanding changes in the case definition of mpox cases, uneven surveillance coverage (including due to the conflict in the eastern provinces of the country), and limited laboratory testing capacity in the DRC introducing some challenges in the interpretation of data , the number of mpox cases reported weekly is plateauing and the geographic distribution of cases, in all provinces in the country, remained very similar to the situation presented at the previous meeting of the Committee. Mathematical modelling work suggests that, since the PHEIC was determined in mid-August 2024 in the DRC, the transmission rate has decreased in certain health zones of the North Kivu and South Kivu Provinces, as well as in some health zones of the capital Kinshasa where vaccination efforts are underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spread of MPXV clade Ia and Ib, in North Kivu, South Kivu, and Kinshasa Provinces of the DRC, as well as in Burundi and Uganda, appears to have started among adults, including through sexual networks involving commercial sex workers and their clients, disproportionately affecting the 20–39 years age group. Since then, in North Kivu and South Kivu Provinces of the DRC, more age group became affected reflecting community transmission through close contact, including household, whereas, in the capital Kinshasa, the spread has remained within the adult population. In Burundi and Uganda, the age distribution of mpox cases shows a bimodal pattern, with high incidence observed among young adults and younger children. This pattern reflects both ongoing sexual transmission and close contact transmission in household settings. The strikingly high proportion of cases among younger children (0-9 age group) observed in Burundi is possibly attributable to transmission occurring within health care facilities settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the three aforementioned countries, community transmission of MPXV clade Ib is also observed in Kenya, Rwanda, and Zambia, while travel-related imported cases have been reported both, by countries in the WHO African Region (Angola, Zimbabwe, with cases in Tanzania being under investigation), and by 14 countries in the five remaining WHO Regions. Most travel-related imported cases are male and, in instances where limited secondary transmission in the country of importation has occurred, a few children have been infected through household contact, including child-to-child transmission on one occasion. The five imported cases with sole travel history to the United Arab Emirates may signal wider mpox transmission in that country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mortality associated with the different MPXV clades in the WHO African Region, and notwithstanding the limitation of surveillance and laboratory diagnostics in the DRC, clade Ia accounts for the majority of fatal cases (1345), corresponding to an average case fatality rate (CFR%) of 2.5-3%, being highest in children under 1 year of age (4–5%). The CFR attributed with clade Ib infection remains very low at around 0.2%, and similar to the that attributed to clade IIb, with recorded deaths associated with specific risk factors such as uncontrolled HIV and other comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO Secretariat also noted an increase in mpox cases reported in West African countries since the PHEIC was determined in mid-August 2024, including the first cases of mpox, due to MPXV clade IIa, reported by Sierra Leone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO Secretariat presented the assessed risk by MPXV clades and further expressed in terms of overall public health risk where any given clade/s is/are circulating, as: Clade Ib – high public health risk in the DRC and neighbouring countries; Clade Ia – moderate public health risk in the DRC; Clade II – moderate public health risk in Nigeria and countries of West and Central Africa where mpox is endemic; and lade IIb – moderate public health risk globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO Secretariat subsequently provided an update on response actions taken together with States Parties and partners since the Committee last met. In addition to the overview provided by the WHO Deputy Director-General, and in the epidemiological overview, the WHO Secretariat provided details on progress and challenges focusing on the aspects of the response outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coordination of emergency operations by the WHO Secretariat was readjusted – including based on action reviews and leveraging the comparative advantages of WHO, State Parties, and partners –prioritizing a flexible, agile, and delivery-focused response. However, while decentralized field operations have intensified, such shifts take time, particularly in specific settings in the DRC and amid changes in geopolitical partnerships. The operational decentralization continues to emphasize increased laboratory diagnostic support, increased dissemination of standards and guidance to deliver safe clinical care, and empowering communities to enhance their efforts to protect themselves from risks associated with mpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, through the Access and Allocation Mechanism (AAM), WHO and partners (Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance (Gavi), and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)) are continuing coordinated and multifaceted efforts to prioritize access to and roll out mpox vaccines in an equitable manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/m/item/mpox-global-strategic-preparedness-and-response-plan/%22"&gt;WHO Mpox global strategic preparedness and response plan, September 2024-February 2025&lt;/a&gt; (SPRP) reaching the end of its initial timeframe, and considering the response strategy it outlines as still fit for purpose, the WHO Secretariat is planning to release an extension of the plan in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2024, the WHO Secretariat launched an appeal for US$&amp;nbsp;87.4&amp;nbsp;million to support mpox response efforts &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/m/item/who-appeal--mpox-public-health-emergency-2024/%22"&gt;WHO appeal: mpox public health emergency 2024&lt;/a&gt; with US$&amp;nbsp;65.5&amp;nbsp;million raised by the time of this meeting. The contribution from the United States had accounted for 33% of the funds raised, of which US$&amp;nbsp;7.5&amp;nbsp;million is currently inaccessible due to the freeze of funds from the United States. As part of planning for the extension of the SPRP, the WHO Secretariat is conducting a review of available resources to address priority needs and mitigate potential future gaps in the delivery of the response. While the above-mentioned freeze is expected to primarily impact operations in Burundi, the Central African Republic, the DRC, the Republic of the Congo, and Rwanda, broader challenges are anticipated for the second and third quarters of 2025. Given the evolving epidemiological situation and challenges noted above, the reduction in predictable and flexible funding throughout 2025 will put at risk the progress of the mpox response to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives of Burundi, the DRC, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Uganda updated the Committee on the mpox epidemiological situation in their countries and their current control and response efforts, needs and challenges, including those related to the freeze of the funds from the United States. The use of mpox vaccine is contemplated in the response plans of the DRC, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Uganda. In Burundi, following action review, community-based interventions that are being strengthened in areas experiencing high incident of mpox include risk communication and awareness raising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of, and the Advisor to, the Committee then engaged in questions and answers, revolving around the issues and challenges enumerated below, with the presenters from States Parties and the WHO Secretariat, as well as with representatives of States Parties invited to submit a written statement to the Committee ahead of the meeting – Canada, China, Nepal, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding – The Committee reiterated the importance of efforts to mobilize domestic financial resources to support mpox response activities. Burundi and the DRC indicated the funds allocated to the response by their respective Governments, also providing details of specific activities supported. The DRC indicated that, at present, the freeze of the funds from the United States is impacting the transportation of clinical specimens and laboratory diagnostics, with a decline in the testing rate, and that the Government is exploring solutions with other partners. The WHO Secretariat added that alternative funding sources are being explored with non-traditional donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age distribution of mpox cases – The WHO Secretariat indicated that (a) there are studies ongoing to determine the secondary attack rate by age group and type of exposure; (b) at least in Burundi, there is no evidence of large outbreaks in settings where children are congregating and, hence, supporting evidence of child-to-child transmission; and (c) in the South Kivu Proving of the DRC, it remains unknown the extent to which transmission to children is occurring beyond the household setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impact of vaccination on transmission – The DRC indicated that, at present, there is no information about whether the use of the limited amount of mpox vaccine available is being effective in interrupting mpox transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DRC – The DRC indicated that, due to insecurity and to decrease in laboratory testing rate, any apparent decrease of the number of reported mpox cases may represent an artifact and should be interpreted with caution. The WHO Secretariat highlighted that, being mpox a relatively mild illness, the rate of underreporting is unknown and that the trends of mpox surveillance data are critical to monitor the evolution of the situation. With respect to detection of a new MPXV clade Ia lineage in Kinshasa, the WHO Secretariat indicated that the strain, similarly to clade Ib, has increased human-to-human transmission potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uganda – Uganda elaborated on the shift of the dynamics of mpox transmission from lower to higher income groups. The initial spread of MPXV clade Ib initiated long-distance truck drivers, it continued in fishing communities, and then within commercial sex networks in the capital Kampala. The fact that more affluent individuals are now affected poses a public health risk both, nationally and internationally. Therefore, the use of mpox vaccine is focused among sex workers in Kampala. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria – Nigeria indicated that, in the context of the mpox response, the human health and animal health sectors are working very closely and that, despite the numerous research initiatives, to date, there is no evidence of animal involvement in sustaining the mpox outbreak in the human population. Nigeria, with a population of 200&amp;nbsp;million persons, indicated that 20&amp;nbsp;000 doses of mpox vaccine have been used in the country, targeting health care workers, female sex workers, and men who have sex with men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Arab Emirates – Considering that, in five instances, travel-related imported cases of MPXV clade Ib infection had sole travel history to the United Arab Emirates, the representative of the country (a) indicated that the National IHR Focal Point reported to WHO the first case of MPXV clade Ib infection; (b) briefly described the surveillance, laboratory diagnostic, case management, and risk communication approaches in place; (c) indicated that mpox vaccine is available to health care workers and as a post-exposure measure; and (d) recalled that the country is bilaterally supporting the response efforts of some African countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom – The United Kingdom (a) described the detection, investigation, and clinical and public health management of the travel-related imported mpox cases; and (b) highlighted that the countries of origin of the imported cases are systematically informed about the occurrences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Deliberative session&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the session open to invited States Parties, the Committee reconvened in a closed session to examine the questions in relation to whether the event constitutes a PHEIC or not, and if so, to consider the temporary recommendations drafted by the WHO Secretariat in accordance with IHR provisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chair reminded the Committee Members of their mandate and recalled that a PHEIC is defined in the IHR as an “extraordinary event, which constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease, and potentially requires a coordinated international response”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Committee was unanimous in expressing the views that the ongoing upsurge of mpox still meets the criteria of a PHEIC and that the Director-General be advised accordingly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overarching considerations underpinning the advice of the Committee are (a) the insecurity in the eastern provinces and in the capital of the DRC – the State Party epicenter of the MPXV clade Ib outbreak –, hampering mpox response field operations and with the potential to morph into a larger scale humanitarian response; (b) the freeze of funding by the United States both, of specific mpox response activities as well as of other, directly or indirectly related, aid interventions; and (c) the continuing detection of travel-related imported mpox cases in States Parties within and outside the WHO African Region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that basis, the Committee considered that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event is “extraordinary” because of (a) the persistent, if not increasing, challenges in gauging the actual magnitude and trend of the MPXV clade Ib outbreak, especially in the DRC. This is thwarting the ability to assess progress, if any, towards controlling the spread of mpox and to adjust response interventions. The Committee’s reading is that, overall, the epidemiological situation is worryingly similar to that observed in November 2024; (b) the unfolding dynamics of MPXV clade Ib transmission, resulting in the shift in age groups affected and, hence, posing challenges in timely targeting response interventions; (c) the co-circulation and the risk of mutations of MPXV clades in the context of sustained community transmission; and (d) the possibility of change in the severity of disease resulting from food insecurity and interruption in the delivery of HIV-related care due to the freeze of aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event “constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease” because of (a) the doubling of the number of States Parties having detected travel-related imported cases of MPXV clade Ib infection since the Committee last met, both in the WHO African Region and in all five other WHO Regions; (b) the possible influx of refugees from the eastern provinces of the DRC into neighbouring countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event “requires a coordinated international response” because of the needs (a) to mobilize, and optimize the use, of financial and other resources to sustain response efforts, at the required level, in the medium term, following the freeze of funding by the United States; and (b) to continue facilitating and increasing equitable access to mpox vaccines and diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Committee subsequently considered the draft of the temporary recommendations proposed by the WHO Secretariat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anticipating the possibility that the WHO Director-General may determine that the event continues to constitute a PHEIC, the Committee had received a proposed set of revised temporary recommendations ahead of the meeting. This reflected the proposal to extend most of the temporary recommendations issued on 27 November 2024. The Committee indicated that it would be giving them further consideration with a view to share its advice in that regard with the WHO Director-General as soon as possible. In such a way, should the WHO Director-General determine that the event continues to constitute a PHEIC, he could proceed, without delay, with issuing such communication together with a prospective revised set of temporary recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Committee agreed to finalize the report of its third meeting during the week of 3 March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Committee reiterated its concern regarding the continuing spread of MPXV in and beyond Africa, considering global geopolitical developments, the humanitarian situation in the DRC, as well as the foreseeable options and opportunities to secure sustainable funding to support response efforts. The Committee considered that the determination by the WHO Director-General that the upsurge of mpox still constitutes a PHEIC would be warranted. However, the Committee cautioned about the possible unintended consequences of determining an event to constitute a PHEIC for extended periods of time, since this could undermine the global public health alert function intrinsic to such a determination and reduce the leverage of a PHEIC in boosting domestic and international response efforts for future events. To that effect, the Committee reiterated the need to elaborate on considerations, related to the three criteria defining a PHEIC, that would inform its future advice to the WHO Director-General as to the termination of this PHEIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Incident Manager for mpox at WHO headquarters, on behalf of the WHO Deputy Director-General, expressed his gratitude to the Committee’s Officers, its Members and Advisor and closed the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//17-03-2025-third-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-upsurge-of-mpox-2024</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//17-03-2025-third-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-upsurge-of-mpox-2024</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:21:53 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>Nearly 50 million people sign up call for clean air action for better health</title><description>&lt;p&gt;In an unprecedented show of unity, more than 47 million health professionals, patients, advocates, representatives from civil society organizations, and individuals worldwide have signed a resounding call for urgent action to reduce air pollution and to protect people’s health from its devastating impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air pollution is one of the biggest environmental threats to human health and a major contributor to climate change. Around 7 million people die from air pollution each year, mainly from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This global call to action, spearheaded by the World Health Organization (WHO) and international health organizations will be presented at the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/events/detail/2025/03/25/default-calendar/second-global-conference-on-air-pollution-and-health/%22"&gt;Second Global Conference on Air Pollution and Health&lt;/a&gt;, set to take place in Cartagena, Colombia, on 25–27 March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Forty-seven million people from the health community have issued a clarion call for urgent, bold, science-driven action on air pollution, and their voices must be heard,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Around the world, WHO is supporting countries to implement evidence-based tools to address air pollution and prevent the disease it causes. At the second WHO Conference on Air Pollution and Health in Cartagena, we hope to see concrete commitments from countries to implement those tools and save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hosted by WHO and the Government of Colombia, the conference will bring together political leaders, representatives from civil society organizations, UN agencies and academia to drive a global clean air agenda which promises benefits for public health, climate change response and sustainable development, both globally and locally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the heavy toll of air pollution, the health community is calling on governments to take immediate and ambitious steps to reduce emissions, enforce stricter air quality standards, and transition to cleaner energy sources, unlocking multiple benefits for the health of people and planet. The topic will also be a focus ahead of the 2025 UN High-Level Meeting on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), where world leaders will be called upon to take stronger action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key facts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Air pollution in both cities and rural areas generates fine particulate matter which results in NCDs such as stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, chronic respiratory diseases as well as acute conditions such as pneumonia.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Around 2.1&amp;nbsp;billion people are exposed to dangerous levels of household air pollution, while using polluting open fires or stoves for cooking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), are among the leading causes of death, many are linked to air pollution exposure. The global NCD epidemic claims 41 million lives annually. Addressing air pollution is a key strategy in reducing the burden of NCDs and improving global health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sources of air pollution are varied and context-specific. The major pollution sources include polluting energy sources used in homes, energy production, industrial emissions, transport, agriculture, waste as well as natural sources such as desert and dust storms or wildfires.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving air quality by implementing well-known and available solutions will prevent premature deaths, improve health, drive sustainable economic development, and mitigate climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the conference, countries are expected to commit to concrete measures, including setting and enforcing stronger air quality standards aligned with the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789240034228/%22"&gt;WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. WHO, in collaboration with the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.swisstph.ch/en//%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH)&lt;/a&gt;, has unveiled the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/tools/air-quality-standards/%22"&gt;updated 2025 Air Quality Standards database&lt;/a&gt; last month, which now includes data from approximately 140 countries, showcasing their air pollution regulatory efforts aimed at protecting public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the challenge is immense, progress is possible. Many cities and countries have significantly improved air quality by enforcing stricter pollution limits,” said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director for Environment, Climate Change and Health. “Clean air is not a privilege; it is a human right as recognized by the UN General Assembly. We need to work together urgently to scale up transitioning from coal-fired power to renewable energy, expanding public and sustainable transport, establishing low-emission zones in cities and promoting clean energy for cooking and solar power in healthcare facilities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commitments made at the upcoming Second Global Conference on Air Pollution and Health and the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/teams/noncommunicable-diseases/on-the-road-to-2025/%22"&gt;UN High-Level Meeting on NCDs&lt;/a&gt; will play a crucial role in paving the way for a healthier, more sustainable future for all. Now is the time to take the call and step up efforts for cleaner air, everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For interviews, please contact WHO Media Team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//17-03-2025-nearly-50-million-people-sign-up-call-for-clean-air-action-for-better-health</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//17-03-2025-nearly-50-million-people-sign-up-call-for-clean-air-action-for-better-health</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 08:27:57 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>The multi-partner Access and Allocation Mechanism allocates 238 000 doses of mpox vaccine to four countries</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Following the emergence of mpox subclade Ib in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in September 2023, the World Health Organization declared mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the first allocation round in November 2024, where the &lt;a target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" href="https://www.who.int/%22/initiatives/i-mcm-net/%22"&gt;Access and Allocation Mechanism (AAM) &lt;/a&gt;allocated 899 000 vaccine doses to nine African countries, the AAM has allocated an additional 238 000 doses during a second allocation round. These doses will benefit four countries severely affected by the mpox surge: Angola, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Uganda. These countries are in the process of accepting the doses, and shipment arrangements are underway. These vaccines are vital in reducing transmission and containing outbreaks of mpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work of the AAM, which is a collaboration of Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention; the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; UNICEF and WHO, highlights the importance of international coordination in addressing public health emergencies. By working together, countries and organizations can ensure that medical countermeasures reach those most in need, ultimately saving lives and preventing further spread of the disease. This second allocation of mpox vaccines marks a significant step towards a coordinated and targeted response to the ongoing health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//15-03-2025-the-multi-partner-access-and-allocation-mechanism-allocates-238000-doses-of-mpox-vaccine-to-four-countries</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//15-03-2025-the-multi-partner-access-and-allocation-mechanism-allocates-238000-doses-of-mpox-vaccine-to-four-countries</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>UN Commission approves WHO recommendations to place psychoactive substances under international control</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Following recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) has decided to place five new psychoactive substances and one medicine under international control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommendations were developed by WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence--ECDD, which consists of global experts analyzing health risks and benefits of psychoactive substances circulating on global markets and alerting to include them under international control if evidence found that their use can cause harm for population health in countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These substances have been brought to WHO’s attention for being clandestinely manufactured, posing serious risk to public health and society without any recognized therapeutic use,” said Dr Deus Mubangizi, WHO Director for Health Product Policy and Standards. “We are pleased that the Commission (on Narcotic Drugs) has accepted the full set of WHO recommendations and added these substances to relevant schedules in the 1961 or 1971 Conventions. We hope countries and communities will increase vigilance and take necessary actions to protect vulnerable groups particularly youth from these substances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four substances placed in Schedule I of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961), as amended by the 1972 Protocol are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N-Pyrrolidino protonitazene&lt;/strong&gt;, also referred to as protonitazepyne, is a synthetic opioid.&amp;nbsp; It has been described as a beige powder or a white colourless or crystalline solid, and has been identified in falsified pharmaceutical opioid tablets. It is reported to be administered by various routes, including smoking, snorting and by injection. It can cause substantial harm, including death. It has no known therapeutic use. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N-Pyrrolidino metonitazene&lt;/strong&gt;, also referred to as metonitazepyne, is a synthetic opioid. It has been described as a beige powder and is reported to be administered by injection. There is evidence that its use causes substantial harm, including death. It has no known therapeutic use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Etonitazepipne&lt;/strong&gt;, also referred to as N-piperidinyl etonitazene, is a synthetic opioid.&amp;nbsp; It has been described as a crystalline solid and a yellowish-white or yellow powder. There is evidence that use of this substance causes substantial harm, including death. It has no known therapeutic use. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;text-decoration:underline;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N-Desethyl isotonitazene&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;text-decoration:underline;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;also referred to as norisotonitazene, is a synthetic opioid that has been described as a crystalline solid. It has been identified in falsified pharmaceuticals. Multiple deaths and hospital admissions have been reported in at least two regions. There is evidence that its use causes substantial harm, including death. It has no known therapeutic use. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substance placed in Schedule II of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hexahydrocannabinol&lt;/strong&gt;, also known as HHC, is a semi-synthetic cannabinoid described as a colourless viscous oil or resin. Products such as THC cannabis flowers and resins infused or sprayed with the substance, e-liquids and cartridges for electronic cigarettes, edible products such as gummies and marshmallows, tinctures resembling dietary supplements and distillate oils can include HHC. There is sufficient evidence that HHC is used in ways to constitute a public health and social problem, warranting placement under international control. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substance placed in Schedule IV of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carisoprodol &lt;/strong&gt;is&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant sold as a single-ingredient preparation and in combination products. Carisoprodol is available as a pharmaceutical product in tablet form, has been detected in falsified pharmaceuticals and is also found as a white powder. There is increasing evidence that nonmedical use of carisoprodol in a number of countries constitutes a significant risk to public health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO has been convening the ECDD as a scientific advisory body for over 70 years with the mission to protect populations from harmful substances and to ensure that psychoactive substances are available where needed for medical and scientific purposes. The ECDD conducts scientific reviews at the request of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs and is the only treaty-mandated body to provide health recommendations to the Commission to inform decisions in drug policy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the ongoing emergence of more harmful substances, including clandestinely manufactured synthetic opioids with no medical use such as fentanyl and nitazenes, Member States expressed interest in more scientific reviews of these substances by WHO in the coming period. Above-mentioned decisions were announced at the 68&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; regular session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, taking place in Vienna, Austria, on 10-14 March 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//13-03-2025-un-commission-approves-who-recommendations-to-place-psychoactive-substances-under-international-control</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//13-03-2025-un-commission-approves-who-recommendations-to-place-psychoactive-substances-under-international-control</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 15:18:16 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>Medical Product Alert N°1/2025: Falsified (contaminated) OXYCONTIN 80mg</title><description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alert Summary &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This WHO Medical Product Alert refers to one batch of falsified OXYCONTIN 80mg (oxycodone hydrochloride). The falsified product was detected in the unregulated market in Switzerland and reported to WHO in February 2025 by the genuine manufacturer MUNDIPHARMA. The falsified product imitates genuine OXYCONTIN 80mg authorized in Poland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OXYCONTIN (oxycodone hydrochloride) is a semi-synthetic opioid indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory testing of samples of the falsified product was conducted by the Drug Information Centre of the City of Zurich (DIZ), Switzerland. DIZ’s drug checking service determined that the tablets did not contain oxycodone, but a synthetic opioid likely to be a nitazene compound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nitazene derivatives (e.g., metonitazene, isotonitazene, fluonitazene) are potent synthetic opioids, primarily used in research due to their high addiction potential and severe side-effects.&amp;nbsp; These substances can be hundreds of times stronger than oxycodone, posing a high overdose risk. Limited information is available on their risks, toxicity, side-effects, and long-term consequences. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to identify this falsified product&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This product is confirmed as falsified because it deliberately misrepresents its identity, composition, and source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The falsified product imitates OXYCONTIN 80mg manufactured and marketed by MUNDIPHARMA in the Polish market. MUNDIPHARMA has confirmed that the product, subject of this alert, is falsified and was not produced by their company&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In identifying this product as falsified, the following visible discrepancies were noted &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The placement of the batch and expiry date on the falsified product is incorrect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the falsified product the batch and expiry date are visible on the front side of the blister strip. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genuine OXYCONTIN has the batch and expiry date visible on the back of the blister strip.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the falsified product the expiry date is on the left and the batch number on the right.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genuine OXYCONTIN has the batch number on the left and the expiry date on the right. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please refer to the &lt;a target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" href="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/substandard-and-falsified/n1_2025_oxycontin_en.pdf?sfvrsn=42d676f5_6\%22"&gt;Annex&lt;/a&gt; of this Alert for full details of the falsified product.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This falsified product has been found to contain undeclared nitazene compounds, which pose a significant risk due to the high likelihood of adverse events, even in small doses. Nitazenes produce effects similar to other opioids.&amp;nbsp; Their &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://ecddrepository.org/en/metonitazene/%22"&gt;high potency&lt;/a&gt; carries a high risk of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/opioid-overdose//%22"&gt;overdose&lt;/a&gt; and death. Using nitazene derivatives has been linked to several deaths. Mixing them with other depressants like alcohol or benzodiazepines can be very dangerous, leading to severe effects like respiratory depression, low blood pressure, coma, or even death. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This falsified product poses a particular risk to individuals with &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/resources-for-substance-use-disorders/%22"&gt;substance use disorders&lt;/a&gt; who may perceive this falsified product as a safe and quality assured medicine. Falsified OXYCONTIN has previously been reported to WHO from Poland, Switzerland, Sweden, and Ireland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice to health-care professionals, regulatory authorities and the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;public &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health-care professionals should report adverse effects, lack of expected effects, or suspected falsification to the National Regulatory Authorities or National Pharmacovigilance Centre. If an overdose from OXYCONTIN is suspected (especially from a product bought on the informal market), be aware that nitazene poisoning is a possibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO advises increased surveillance and diligence in supply chains and the informal market in countries/regions likely to be affected. Authorities should notify WHO immediately if these falsified products are detected in their country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO advises against using these products. If you or someone you know has used them or experienced adverse effects, seek immediate medical advice or contact a poison control center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All medical products must be obtained from authorized/licensed suppliers.

Christophe Payot, Ambassador of Belgium to the United Nations and other international organizations in Geneva&amp;nbsp;– discussed issues of strategic importance, exchanged views on how to smoothly align WHO strategic directions and Belgium's development cooperation priorities in the context of an evolving global health landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partners exchanged updates on Belgium's support to global health areas brought in the spotlight during the Belgian presidency of Council of the European Union in 2024. WHO was represented by leadership and technical experts from Headquarters and from the Regional Offices for Africa and for Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"After listening to the leaders and experts of WHO we now better understand how they are navigating these challenging times\", said Mr Koen Van Acoleyen, Minister Counselor at the Permanent Representation of Belgium to the UN. \"We are honoured that we can walk this road together.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Accelerating equitable access to vaccines, medicines and health technologies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partners reviewed the current status and the most noticeable results achieved by the Access to Medicines programme funded by Belgium. WHO illustrated its work and challenges with an example of country-level implementation in Senegal. It also explained WHO's policies and work on equitable access and local production. Both parties recognized a shared goal for sustainability of the Access to Medicines initiative, as market shaping is key to ensure long-term success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Health emergencies and pandemic prevention, preparedness and response&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussions covered WHO's role in strengthening the global architecture for health emergency prevention, preparedness, response and resilience, including the pandemic agreement negotiations and the One Health approach. WHO's crucial field work on health emergency response was demonstrated by presenting the activities in Gaza. The debate also touched upon threats posed by acceleration of biological risks and zoonoses, along with WHO engagement, in particular, risk mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Universal Health Coverage (UHC)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elaborating on progress made on UHC-Partnership, the participants reviewed results achieved by WHO with Belgium support in the period 2021-2024, specifically in Belgium's partner countries. They discussed the way forward, exploring the potential for enhanced collaboration at country level, including eventual alignment between WHO country office programmes and Belgium's country level bilateral cooperation. Examples included a summary of the work and challenges at country level from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The visitors listened to a recap of WHO's policies and work on mental health in the context of primary health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partners also reviewed progress in other areas of collaboration on WHO programmes supported by Belgium, such as Neglected Tropical Diseases and Sexual, Reproductive Health and Rights. The review underpinned the importance of an evidence-based approach in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO appreciates Belgium's commitment and engagement, displayed by the participation of representatives of the country's Federal government as well as the Flemish and Walloon governments. \"We thank you for your support, honesty, and strong engagement for global health\", said Dr Catharina Boehme, Assistant Director-General, External Relations and Governing Bodies. \"Your efforts in supporting our work in Mozambique and Senegal are clear examples of the crucial work we accomplish together\".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Looking into the future&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partners discussed ways forward for the Belgium-WHO collaboration framework and multi-year agreement, including progress towards a renewed WHO-Belgium Country Cooperation Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enhanced collaboration between Belgium and WHO will support a strong global health agenda under the WHO 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; General Programme of Work (GPW14). There was a shared vision that UHC and health systems strengthening being at the heart of GPW14 ambitions will be taken as essential scope in WHO's ongoing prioritization work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We recognize WHO as a trustworthy partner in global health. We felt proud hearing how crucial our support is to the Organization and how it is having a positive impact at country, regional, and global levels\", said Mr Dirk Brems, Director of Thematic and Multilateral Cooperation, Directorate-General Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid. \"It's important we continue these discussions as we tread uncharted territories, and we look forward to working together for strong and sustained multilateralism\".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="\&amp;quot;text-align:center;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;img sf-image-responsive="\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;" src="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/funding/strategic-dialogue-belgium-and-who-representatives.jpg?sfvrsn=8548e3f4_3\%22" height="\&amp;quot;1280\&amp;quot;" style="\&amp;quot;max-width:100%;height:auto;\&amp;quot;" title="\&amp;quot;Strategic" dialogue="" belgium="" and="" who="" representatives\"="" width="\&amp;quot;1920\&amp;quot;" alt="\&amp;quot;Strategic" sf-size="\&amp;quot;453217\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Belgian delegation from the Federal government, as well as Flemish and Walloon governments with WHO representatives, 2-5 March 2025.

In addition to underlining their commitment to global efforts to eradicate polio, Member States and key stakeholders expressed their support for the long-term sustainable transition of polio assets, knowledge and infrastructure into national health systems and recipient programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Strengthening health systems through immunization, surveillance, outbreak response and containment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;The aims of polio transition efforts are outlined in the &lt;a target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789240100633/%22"&gt;polio transition strategic framework&lt;/a&gt;. The polio transition process focuses on sustaining the polio investments – the tools, knowledge and infrastructure built to eradicate polio over the past decades – to keep the world polio-free and build strong, resilient and equitable health systems. Since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was established in 1988, the polio eradication programme has become a critical backbone of public health in some of the most challenging contexts worldwide. Sustaining the essential functions of strong immunization, sensitive surveillance, rapid outbreak response and robust containment of polioviruses following the eradication of polio is important to prevent the disease returning, and to strengthen broader public health.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several Member States commented on the progress being made on polio transition in priority countries. Somalia discussed work being undertaken by the government to increase the capacity of frontline polio health workers to undertake vaccine delivery and surveillance for other diseases. Meanwhile, Norway voiced their support for the implementation of the polio transition agenda, especially where infrastructure and personnel can be leveraged to reach zero-dose children and strengthen primary health care. Action plans for transition are tailored to local context, with progress monitored through regular &lt;a target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" href="https://www.who.int/%22/teams/polio-transition-programme/monitoring-and-evaluation-dashboard/%22"&gt;monitoring and evaluation&lt;/a&gt; to enable course corrections.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;color:inherit;font-family:'Open" sans="" condensed',="" sans-serif;font-size:var(--font-size-h3);font-weight:bold;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\"=""&gt;Robust systems through eradication and beyond&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Speakers also emphasized the potential for polio transition and integration to strengthen national health systems. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, stressed the importance of integrating polio-funded assets into existing national health systems, a move that is critical for sustaining immunization gains and fortifying overall health security, a key global health priority. Meanwhile, Canada supported the strengthening of country capacity and the provision of technical assistance and training to Member States to enable them to independently support the polio essential functions. Indonesia, where significant work has been undertaken on transition, called for sustainable financing to secure polio essential functions for the long term. This is especially important given the challenging contexts where much of the polio eradication infrastructure is located.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Another theme was the steps required to prevent any future resurgence of the virus. The polio post-certification strategy (PCS), which sets out the technical standards to sustain a polio-free world, is currently undergoing revision. Thailand endorsed the revision process, which enables new technologies and best practices to be reflected in the document. Several countries also emphasized the importance of working collaboratively, particularly to maintain strong surveillance, during the post-certification era. The post-certification strategy has three core aims: to protect populations, to detect and respond to a polio event or outbreak, and to contain poliovirus. These aims are aligned with the polio transition strategic framework. Sustainable transition, including strong country ownership and financing, will be central to help lay the groundwork for the implementation of the PCS.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Across their comments, Member States called for continued collaboration, investment, and country-driven leadership to achieve eradication, ensure a sustainable transition, and plan for post-certification. Joint efforts and a strong focus on implementation are key to achieving and sustaining a polio-free world and building stronger, resilient and equitable health systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//10-03-2025-member-states-support-polio-transition-progress-at-156th-executive-board</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//10-03-2025-member-states-support-polio-transition-progress-at-156th-executive-board</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 15:04:35 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>World Health Day 2025: explore free courses to enhance maternal and newborn health</title><description>&lt;p&gt;World Health Day, celebrated on 7 April 2025, will launch a year-long campaign focused on maternal and newborn health.

released today by the World Health Organization (WHO). These conditions were responsible for around 80 000 and 50 000 fatalities respectively in 2020 – the last year for which  &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789240068759/%22"&gt;published estimates&lt;/a&gt; are available - highlighting that many women still lack access to lifesaving treatments and effective care during and after pregnancy and birth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the Lancet Global Health, the study is WHO’s first global update on the causes of maternal deaths since the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals were adopted in 2015. In addition to outlining the major direct obstetric causes, it shows that other health conditions, including both infectious and chronic diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, anaemias, and diabetes, underpin nearly a quarter (23%) of pregnancy and childbirth-related mortality. These conditions, which often go undetected or untreated until major complications occur, exacerbate risk and complicate pregnancies for millions of women around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding why pregnant women and mothers are dying is critical for tackling the world’s lingering maternal mortality crisis and ensuring women have the best possible chances of surviving childbirth,” said Dr Pascale Allotey, Director of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research at WHO as well as the UN’s Special Programme on Human Reproduction (HRP). “This is also a massive equity issue globally - women everywhere need high quality, evidence-based health care before, during and after delivery, as well as efforts to prevent and treat other underlying conditions that jeopardize their health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, there were an estimated 287 000 maternal deaths in total – equivalent to one death every two minutes. This new WHO study reports that haemorrhage - mostly occurring during or following childbirth - is responsible for nearly a third (27%) of maternal mortality, with preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders contributing to an additional 16%. Preeclampsia is a serious condition characterized by high blood pressure that can lead to haemorrhage, strokes, organ failures and seizures if left untreated or treated too late. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other direct causes include: sepsis and infections; pulmonary embolism; complications from spontaneous and induced abortions - including miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, and issues relating to unsafe abortions – and, anesthetic complications and injuries that occur during childbirth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight the need to strengthen key aspects of maternity care, including antenatal services that detect risks early in pregnancy and prevent severe complications; lifesaving obstetrics that can manage critical birth-related emergencies like haemorrhage or embolism, and postnatal care. Most maternal deaths occur during or shortly after childbirth, making this a critical window to save lives. However, around a third of women – primarily in lower income countries - still do not receive essential postnatal checks in the first days after birth. &amp;nbsp;At a population level, broader preventive interventions could help reduce the prevalence of underlying health conditions - like noncommunicable diseases and malnutrition - that increase women’s risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Often not just one but many interrelated factors contribute to a woman dying during or after pregnancy– preeclampsia for instance can significantly increase the likelihood of haemorrhage as well as other complications that may occur even long after childbirth,” said Dr Jenny Cresswell, Scientist at WHO and an author of the paper. “A more holistic approach to maternal health has been proven to give women the best chance of a healthy pregnancy and birth, and of enjoying lasting quality of life after delivery – health systems need to be able to support them across different life stages.”&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study draws on national data that is reported to WHO, as well as peer-reviewed studies. For some causes, data remains limited. In particular, the authors call for more data on maternal suicide, which is currently available for only 12 countries. In addition, most countries do not report on late maternal deaths (those that occur in the year following childbirth), although several conditions can lead to risks lasting much beyond the birth itself. After childbirth, many women  &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news/item/07-12-2023-more-than-a-third-of-women-experience-lasting-health-problems-after-childbirth/%22"&gt;struggle to access follow-up care&lt;/a&gt;, including mental health support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO works to strengthen access to high quality, respectful services across the continuum of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news/item/07-11-2016-new-guidelines-on-antenatal-care-for-a-positive-pregnancy-experience/%22"&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news/item/12-10-2023-improving-the-experience-of-pregnant-and-birthing-women/%22"&gt;childbirth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news/item/30-03-2022-who-urges-quality-care-for-women-and-newborns-in-critical-first-weeks-after-childbirth/%22"&gt;postnatal care&lt;/a&gt;, through evidence-based research and guidelines. In 2024, WHO and partners launched a global  &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news/item/11-10-2023-who-issues-global-plan-to-tackle-leading-cause-of-death-in-childbirth/%22"&gt;Roadmap for Postpartum Haemorrhage&lt;/a&gt;, which outlines key priorities for tackling this major cause of maternal death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same year, the World Health Assembly’s 194 countries passed a  &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news/item/30-05-2024-countries-commit-to-recover-lost-progress-in-maternal--newborn---child-survival/%22"&gt;Resolution&lt;/a&gt; committing to strengthen quality care before, during and after childbirth. To galvanize action, World Health Day 2025 – which marks five years from the Sustainable Development Goals deadline—will focus on maternal and newborn health. The campaign will call for a major intensification of efforts to ensure access to high quality, proven care for women and babies, especially in the poorest countries and crisis settings where the vast majority of deaths occur. Beyond survival, the campaign will also showcase the need for broader attention to women’s health, including postnatal care and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, Global and regional causes of maternal deaths 2009-2020: a WHO systematic analysis, updates a previous analysis conducted in 2014 which covered the period 2003-2009. Haemorrhage was also responsible for the largest share of deaths in the previous analysis (27%). The study is available here:  &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(24)00560-6/fulltext/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" data-sf-marked="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(24)00560-6/fulltext&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data were identified via three main pathways: the WHO Mortality Database; reports published by WHO Member States (MMEIG Database); and journal articles identified via bibliographic databases. Maternal causes of death are grouped into categories aligned with the International Classification of Diseases-Maternal Mortality (ICD-MM) coding: abortion (relating to miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy and induced abortion), embolism, haemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, pregnancy-related sepsis, other direct causes, and indirect causes described above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New estimates for the total numbers of maternal deaths, including global, regional and country-level data, will be published in April 2025, covering the period 2000-2023.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//08-03-2025-many-pregnancy-related-complications-going-undetected-and-untreated--who</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//08-03-2025-many-pregnancy-related-complications-going-undetected-and-untreated--who</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Mar 2025 23:20:41 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>WHO and Switzerland cement cooperation until 2028</title><description>&lt;p&gt;WHO and Switzerland have announced the renewal of their cooperation strategy for the period 2024-2028.

However, harnessing its benefits for good requires collaboration from stakeholders committed to robust governance, ethical safeguards, and evidence-based policies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;color:inherit;font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\&amp;quot;"&gt;The WHO Collaborating Centre designation recognizes the Digital Ethics Centre at Delft University of Technology's decades-long history of cutting-edge research on responsible innovation, and its leadership in incorporating ethical values into design requirements for digital technologies. This inauguration marks the continuation of a strong partnership between the Digital Ethics Centre and WHO with the two entities jointly organizing international consultations, workshops, and the development of normative guidance and training in the past.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“WHO is committed to helping Member States plan, govern, and adopt responsible AI technologies,” said Dr Alain Labrique, Director of Digital Health and Innovation at WHO. “We are witnessing remarkable progress, with AI poised to transform health systems and support individuals on their health journeys. To ensure these benefits reach everyone ethically, safely, and equitably, we rely on strong technical and academic partnerships that guide us in this rapidly evolving field.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Collaborating Centre on AI for health governance will be instrumental in WHO’s efforts to ensure the ethical and responsible use of AI for health by advancing research on priority topics and providing expert input for WHO’s guidance development and policy-making. The Centre will serve as a hub for education and advocacy for science-driven research and facilitate knowledge-sharing and training through regional and country-level workshops.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fruit of two decades of research in digital ethics and responsible innovation, the Delft Digital Ethics Centre is one of the frontrunners in operationalizing ethical values into design requirements for digital technologies such as artificial intelligence,\" Professor Jeroen van den Hoven, Scientific Director at Delft Digital Ethics Centre noted.&lt;strong&gt; \"&lt;/strong&gt;We look forward to contributing to the global health community and advancing the responsible use of AI in health.\"&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Responsible and Ethical AI for Healthcare Lab, a collaboration between Delft University of Technology and its partners, will provide valuable insight into the challenges involved in the successful implementation of WHO guidance in clinical practice.&amp;nbsp;\"The designation of the Digital Ethics Centre at Delft University of Technology as a WHO Collaborating Centre strengthens our collective ability to ensure AI serves public health equitably and responsibly.

Yet, systemic barriers continue to place women at higher health risks, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Message by the Director-General\r\n&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" class="\&amp;quot;-sf-relative\&amp;quot;" contenteditable="\&amp;quot;false\&amp;quot;" style="\&amp;quot;width:640px;height:360px;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;div data-sf-disable-link-event="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;div sf-youtube-url="\&amp;quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oZZ9tN5PLM\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;" allowfullscreen="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" allow="\&amp;quot;accelerometer;" autoplay;="" clipboard-write;="" encrypted-media;="" gyroscope;="" picture-in-picture;="" web-share\"="" title="\&amp;quot;On" this="" international="" women's="" day,="" we="" stand="" at="" a="" pivotal="" moment\"="" width="\&amp;quot;640\&amp;quot;" height="\&amp;quot;360\&amp;quot;" src="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/embed/_oZZ9tN5PLM?v=_oZZ9tN5PLM&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.who.int&amp;amp;widgetid=2&amp;amp;forigin=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.who.int%2FSitefinity%2Fadminapp%2Fcontent%2Fnewsitems%2F(cea8c430-18b3-412b-8cf1-f11f072c05a8%2Fedit%2F%2Fdialog%3Aconfirm%2Fdefault)%3Fsf_provider%3DOpenAccessDataProvider%26sf_culture%3Den&amp;amp;aoriginsup=1&amp;amp;vf=1\%22" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider household air pollution - an issue disproportionately affecting women. Women exposed\r\n    to harmful pollutants from household fuels face a 46% higher risk of developing cataracts compared to those unexposed. NCDs further exacerbate gendered health disparities&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;: two out of three women die from NCDs such as cancer,\r\n    diabetes, cardiovascular diseases&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt; and respiratory conditions, with most deaths occurring in low- and\r\n    middle-income countries.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Violence against women remains a global crisis, severely impacting their health and well-being. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240022256/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;One in three women&lt;/a&gt; worldwide experiences physical or sexual violence, and the health-care sector itself is not immune. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240082854/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Nearly a quarter of all workplace violence&lt;/a&gt; occurs in health and care settings, with women disproportionately affected.

Women are the backbone of the global health and care workforce, yet their contributions often go &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240082854/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;unrecognized and undervalued&lt;/a&gt;.

Yet, they encounter obstacles, such as earning &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/9789240052895/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;24 percent less than men&lt;/a&gt;, even after accounting for factors such as experience and education. Pay gaps are even wider for mothers and women from marginalized backgrounds. However, this is not inevitable, as there are many effective policies that support the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240073852/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;rights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240052895/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;equality&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240082854/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;empowerment&lt;/a&gt; of this crucial workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To create truly equitable and effective health systems, women must be at the forefront - not just as caregivers but as leaders and decision-makers. Their leadership can drive systemic change, from advancing gender-responsive policies to securing investments in women’s health research. WHO reaffirms its commitment to championing these efforts, pushing for policies, funding&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt; and research that ensure meaningful and lasting impact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p paraid="\&amp;quot;455981731\&amp;quot;" paraeid="\&amp;quot;{178e9216-059b-4537-80fa-a9a4234b6004}{131}\&amp;quot;"&gt;Health is a crucial step on the road to gender\r\n    equality. To achieve this, health systems must prioritize&amp;nbsp;women’s and girls’ health needs and their full\r\n    participation in the workforce. By creating opportunities for women to participate equally at every\r\n    level, including in decision making, we can transform health systems, bridge gender gaps&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt; and build a healthier, more equitable world. Now is the time to turn the commitments of the Beijing Declaration into action and ensure that both women’s health needs and their advancement in the workforce drive lasting, transformative change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//06-03-2025-building-a-healthier-world-by-women-and-for-women-is-key-to-achieving-gender-equality</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//06-03-2025-building-a-healthier-world-by-women-and-for-women-is-key-to-achieving-gender-equality</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>Advancing healthier populations goals with multi-country efforts to tackle industry interference</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Between&amp;nbsp;September and November 2024, officials and other nominees including nongovernmental organization representatives from six countries across all six WHO regions convened to share experiences and develop innovative solutions to meet the challenge of industry interference and address the commercial determinants of health. The missions, led by WHO’s Division of Data, Analytics and Delivery for Impact, together with WHO’s Department of Social Determinants of Health, explored lessons learned on how to overcome industry interference across critical public health issues including tobacco, alcohol, health-harming foods, sugary beverages and road safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participating countries discussed a number of shared challenges, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;aligning economic objectives &amp;nbsp;with public health goals;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;putting public health before commercial interests in complex situations, including where there are challenges with enforcement; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;addressing gaps in conflict-of-interest policies, rules and approaches; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;addressing industry tactics to undermine health, including non-compliance, obfuscation and coalition-building.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common challenge presented during the missions was the structural power imbalances that make smaller countries vulnerable to industry interference by large transnational commercial actors. This has been previously identified as an area for increased WHO support to countries and is a topic being addressed through global and regional initiatives to support Small Island Developing States (SIDS) including in a forthcoming WHO technical paper on the Economic and commercial determinants of health in Small Island Developing States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries also highlighted opportunities for progress, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;strengthening multi-sectoral collaboration and whole-of-government approaches to address the commercial determinants of health;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;building capacity to counter misinformation and implement conflict-of-interest safeguards; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;working with WHO to support evidence-based advocacy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO will strive to provide targeted technical assistance, support capacity-building, and foster a global community of practice on the commercial determinants of health to these and other countries to protect health, promote well being and save lives. &lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//05-03-2025-advancing-the-healthier-populations-billion-with-multi-country-virtual-missions-on-tackling-industry-interference</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//05-03-2025-advancing-the-healthier-populations-billion-with-multi-country-virtual-missions-on-tackling-industry-interference</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 15:34:30 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>Funding cuts impact access to TB services endangering millions of lives</title><description>&lt;p&gt;In the past two decades, tuberculosis (TB) prevention, testing and treatment services have saved more than 79&amp;nbsp;million lives – averting approximately 3.65&amp;nbsp;million deaths last year alone from the world’s deadliest infectious disease. This progress has been driven by critical foreign aid especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly from USAID. However, abrupt funding cuts now threaten to undo these hard-won gains, putting millions – especially the most vulnerable – at grave risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on data reported by national TB programmes to WHO and reporting by the United States of America government to the creditor reporting system of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United States government has provided approximately US$&amp;nbsp;200–250 million annually in bilateral funding for the TB response at country level. This funding was approximately one quarter of the total amount of international donor funding for TB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2025 funding cuts will have a devastating impact on TB programmes, particularly in LMICs that rely heavily on international aid, given the United States has been the largest bilateral donor. These cuts put 18 of the highest burden countries at risk, as they depended on 89% of the expected United States funding for TB care. The WHO African Region is hardest hit by the funding disruptions, followed by the WHO South-East Asian and Western Pacific Regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any disruption to TB services – whether financial, political or operational – can have devastating and often fatal consequences for millions worldwide,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of WHO’s Global Programme on TB and Lung Health. “The COVID-19 pandemic proved this, as service interruptions led to over 700&amp;nbsp;000 excess deaths from TB between 2020 and 2023, exacerbated by inadequate social protection measures. Without immediate action, hard-won progress in the fight against TB is at risk. Our collective response must be swift, strategic and fully resourced to protect the most vulnerable and maintain momentum toward ending TB.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;TB response in peril: essential service disruptions escalate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandated by heads of state, WHO plays a crucial leadership role in guiding countries toward the End TB targets for 2027 and 2030. Early reports to WHO from the 30 highest TB-burden countries confirm that funding withdrawals are already dismantling essential services, threatening the global fight against TB. This includes health and community workforce crises with thousands of health workers in high-burden countries facing layoffs, while technical assistance roles have been suspended, crippling national TB programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug supply chains are breaking down due to staff suspensions, lack of funds and data failures, jeopardizing access to TB treatment and prevention services. Laboratory services are severely disrupted, with sample transportation, procurement delays and shortages of essential consumables halting diagnostic efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data and surveillance systems are collapsing, undermining routine reporting and drug resistance monitoring. Community engagement efforts – including active case finding, screening and contact tracing – are deteriorating, reducing early TB detection and increasing transmission risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without immediate intervention, these systemic failures will cripple TB prevention and treatment efforts, reverse decades of progress and endanger millions of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, USAID, the world's third-largest TB research funder, has halted all its funded trials, severely disrupting progress in TB research and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHO commitment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these challenging times, WHO remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting national governments, civil society and global partners in securing sustained funding and integrated solutions to safeguard the health and well-being of those most vulnerable to TB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//05-03-2025-funding-cuts-to-tuberculosis-programmes-endanger-millions-of-lives</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//05-03-2025-funding-cuts-to-tuberculosis-programmes-endanger-millions-of-lives</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>Lifelong learning in health: a global outlook from the WHO Academy</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Opened in December 2024, the WHO Academy is moving ahead with it ambition to become the global centre for lifelong learning in health. Last month, it held its inaugural conference in Lyon, France, where learning and health experts from around the world gathered to discuss the role of quality in health learning, training and capacity building. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no widely accepted global standards for high-quality learning courses in health. Building on the World Health Organization’s 75 years of expertise in setting global norms and standards, the WHO Academy aims to promote quality assurance standards in developing, implementing and evaluating learning materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Quality is essential, and it is a key word for the entire operation of the Academy. Providing health and care workers with continuous access to upscaling and rescaling learning is crucial to achieving health for all,” explained Dr David Atchoarena, WHO Academy Executive Director, who also highlighted the Academy’s commitment to bringing together global expertise on learning in public health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her keynote address, Professor Asha Kanwar from Beijing Normal University stressed the urgent need to address the projected global shortfall of 11 million healthcare workers by 2030. She also advocated for integrating technology into lifelong learning, including AI-generated and interactive content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A round table discussion featured global learning and health experts who shared best practices and success stories on improving learning opportunities and implementing online and blended courses. Through a series of in-person workshops in the afternoon, participants shared their inputs on the localization of learning content, the potential of team-based learning and assessments, and what learning recognition of WHO Academy courses could look like to ensure they are well-received by ministries of health or public accreditation bodies in their own contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is necessary to construct a shared vision for lifelong learning. Lifelong learning is a right for health workers. Health workers are committed to their training, so we have to take advantage of that. We need to make lifelong learning more relevant for their careers and ensure their training is more relevant. It is not a personal possession but a collective good,” explained conference participant Isabel Dure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Janusz Janczukowicz from the Medical University of Lodz, Chair of the WHO Academy Quality Committee, concluded the conference by reiterating the importance of interprofessional and team-based learning in providing inclusive and high-quality patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO Academy will promote the incorporation of best practices in learning in the design and delivery of training across WHO to optimize the impact of lifelong learning. The insights from the conference will inform the WHO Academy Quality Standards and Criteria for Learning Programmes,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which will be published in 2025.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The WHO Academy offers a range of free courses on its global online platform, open to anyone who would like to register at &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://whoacademy.org//%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;whoacademy.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//04-03-2025-lifelong-learning-in-health--a-global-outlook-from-the-who-academy</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//04-03-2025-lifelong-learning-in-health--a-global-outlook-from-the-who-academy</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 15:39:23 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>Harnessing innovation and fostering responsible use of life sciences</title><description>&lt;p&gt;In response to the rapid developments in life sciences and emerging technologies, ease of access, diversity of actors and sectors, and gaps in governance of biorisks from dual-use research of concern (DURC), WHO facilitated an online meeting of partners, collaborators, and other stakeholders on 3 December 2024.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This highlight was originally published on the WHO India website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/india/news/detail/04-03-2025-harnessing-innovation-and-fostering-responsible-use-of-life-sciences/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Access the story here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//04-03-2025-harnessing-innovation-and-fostering-responsible-use-of-life-sciences</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//04-03-2025-harnessing-innovation-and-fostering-responsible-use-of-life-sciences</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 13:50:19 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>Recommendations announced for influenza vaccine composition for the 2025–2026 northern hemisphere influenza season</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) today announced the  &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/m/item/recommended-composition-of-influenza-virus-vaccines-for-use-in-the-2025-2026-nh-influenza-season/%22"&gt;recommendations for the viral composition of influenza vaccines for the 2025–2026 influenza season in the northern hemisphere&lt;/a&gt;.

Held as a closed meeting at WHO Headquarters, Members of the three organizations shared experiences on supporting sustainable innovation ecosystems through health, trade and IP. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The imperative to adopt an integrated approach to issues at the crossroads of health, IP and trade has been at the heart of the longstanding collaboration among the three Geneva-based organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments and policymakers are faced with the challenging task of identifying the right mix of policy options to best advance domestic policy objectives to facilitate sustainable innovation. Participants discussed how to facilitate ongoing domestic and regional policy discussions through a more coherent and comprehensive approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members with diverse levels of development and from different regions of the world shared valuable experiences about the implementation of laws and policies in support of sustainable innovation ecosystems and access to the outcomes. This was followed by a roundtable discussion and further complemented by information provided by the three organizations on trilateral and other relevant work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO-WIPO-WTO Technical Assistance virtual Platform was also briefly introduced at the meeting. It allows Members to easily request joint technical assistance from the three organizations to access the full range of expertise at the intersection of health, trade, and IP in a coordinated manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trilateral Briefing series is a set of closed meetings for Members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next briefing session for Geneva-based health, IP and trade attachés is tentatively scheduled to take place in September 2025, after the summer break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/headquarters/teams/access-to-medicines-and-health-products-(mhp)/health-product-policy-and-standards-(hps)/medicines-selection-ip-and-affordability-(mia)/who-wipo-wto-technical-assistance-platform.jpg?sfvrsn=9821b9b2_2\%22" style="\&amp;quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;" class="\&amp;quot;sf-immutable-selected" -align-center\"="" alt="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;47495\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//28-02-2025-who--wipo--and-wto-hold-first-joint-briefing-for-geneva-based-officials</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//28-02-2025-who--wipo--and-wto-hold-first-joint-briefing-for-geneva-based-officials</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 12:14:22 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>New WHO and ITU standard aims to prevent hearing loss among gamers</title><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="\&amp;quot;121969221\&amp;quot;" paraeid="\&amp;quot;{38b51478-2599-4f1b-9559-62b185c5efb3}{195}\&amp;quot;"&gt;Ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-hearing-day/2025/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" rel="\&amp;quot;noreferrer" noopener\"="" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/campaigns/world-hearing-day/2025/%22"&gt;World Hearing Day 2025,&lt;/a&gt; the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) are highlighting the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-H.872-202410-I/en/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" rel="\&amp;quot;noreferrer" noopener\"="" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;first global standard for safe listening in video gameplay and esport activities&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to reduce the risk of and prevent hearing loss among gamers.

People with such asymptomatic forms of TB (aTB) may only be identified during screening with so-called symptom-agnostic tools like chest X-ray or during TB prevalence surveys. Recent reviews found that about one half of people with TB detected by prevalence surveys had bacteriologically confirmed disease but reported no typical TB symptoms upon inquiry. More research is now ongoing to better characterize the full spectrum of TB, from infection to disease.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest in aTB has increased in recent years as more emphasis is being placed on screening and earlier diagnosis. The World Health Organization’s End TB Strategy stresses the importance of TB screening and active case-finding for TB in the first component of its first pillar.&amp;nbsp;In 2021, WHO released updated evidence-based recommendations for systematic TB screening, alongside an operational handbook and new tools to facilitate implementation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We urge national programmes, technical agencies, funding partners, civil society and other stakeholders to work collectively to ensure that all people with TB, including asymptomatic TB, are detected early and receive appropriate treatment. Systematic screening will be critical for countries to achieve global targets on TB,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of the WHO Global Programme on Tuberculosis and Lung Health.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\&amp;quot;"&gt;WHO convened a technical consultation on 14–15 October 2024 in Geneva to agree on a framework and definition of aTB relevant for TB programmes and research, and to identify research gaps on aTB and set priorities that are critical for WHO guidance.

The campaign was conducted as part of emergency efforts to end an ongoing poliovirus outbreak and prevent further spread in the Gaza Strip.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;During this round, an additional 40 000 children were vaccinated as compared to the previous two rounds conducted in September and October 2024, after poliovirus was detected in the Gaza Strip. The ceasefire enabled health workers to reach more children who had missed vaccinations due to displacement during the phased approach, living in areas that previously required special coordination for access, or being unreachable during the October 2024 round due to insecurity in North Gaza, including Jabalia, Beit Lahiya, and Beit Hanoun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong community engagement and awareness of vaccination benefits had maintained high immunization rates in the Gaza Strip, where 89% of children received the third dose of oral polio vaccine in 2023, before the conflict.&amp;nbsp; This round drew upon 1660 vaccination teams, 1242 of which were mobile, and deployed 1242 social mobilizers. Despite bad weather conditions, families welcomed the initiative and brought their children to points where they could receive the polio vaccine.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The campaign was conducted by the Palestinian Ministry of Health and implemented with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), and other partners. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As part of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative’s commitment to mount a robust poliovirus outbreak response, surveillance for disease in children and for virus circulation in the environment has also been intensified since July 2024.

However, abrupt disruptions to foreign aid and service delivery threaten these gains, putting millions of people at risk – especially people living with HIV and key and vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many essential evidence-based prevention interventions, including HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), harm reduction services for people who inject drugs, and community-led programmes have been permanently halted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early reports shared with WHO indicate that prevention and treatment services for key populations are those most affected. Reports include the closure of health centres delivering prevention, testing and treatment interventions for key populations previously supported by U.S. funding. These disruptions are resulting in staffing shortages, supply chain interruptions, and increased barriers to access, leaving key populations – including gay men and other men who have sex with men, sex workers, people who inject drugs, people in prisons, and trans and gender diverse individuals – vulnerable to infection and death, as well as increased stigma and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These developments compromise the ability of service providers to deliver on foundational WHO recommendations that:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;all people living with HIV should receive same-day antiretroviral treatment (ART) both to improve their health and to prevent further transmission by achieving sustained viral load suppression;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;there should be uninterrupted access to ART for all populations, including key populations living with HIV, during service disruptions; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;person-centred approaches should be implemented and non-judgemental, discrimination-free environments created to foster trust, encourage consistent engagement in care, and support re-engagement for those who may have dropped out of treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Essential prevention services must remain a priority&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuring that key populations can access prevention services that are free of discrimination is central to HIV, hepatitis and STI responses. Community-based services have consistently proven effective in increasing access and acceptability of programmes, buffering the effects of stigma and discrimination. These programmes facilitate the delivery of interventions that have been proven effective through rigorous scientific research, and that are recommended by WHO to protect people from new infections and harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core WHO-recommended essential prevention services include condoms and lubricants; testing for HIV, hepatitis B and C, and other STIs; HIV post-exposure prophylaxis and pre-exposure prophylaxis; and harm reduction activities including distribution of needles and syringes, of naloxone to prevent deaths from overdose, and opioid agonist maintenance treatment programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Commitment to sustainable financing and integrated health systems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As countries and ministries of health work to mitigate the impact of service disruptions, they must pursue long-term solutions, including sustainable domestic financing to protect these vital health services. This is essential for maintaining the downward trend in HIV incidence and mortality, and to progress toward hepatitis elimination and STI control.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO also emphasizes the value of an integrated approach to HIV, bringing together stigma and discrimination-free services for tuberculosis, viral hepatitis, sexual and reproductive health, and noncommunicable diseases under the umbrella of strong primary health care. Integrating HIV leads to resource optimization and improvements in overall population health.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO remains committed to supporting national governments, community and civil society&amp;nbsp;partners, and donors in adapting to shifting donor support to safeguard the health and well-being of those most vulnerable to HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Editor’s note&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This departmental update was amended on 3 March 2025 to include \"community and civil society\" in the last paragraph.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//27-02-2025-protecting-key-populations-from-abrupt-disruptions-to-essential-hiv-services</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//27-02-2025-protecting-key-populations-from-abrupt-disruptions-to-essential-hiv-services</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>New WHO partnership with Indian Institute to advance technology transfer and health equity</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The WHO Health Technology Access Programme (HTAP), the WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia and the WHO Country Office for India met with the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) at the Institute’s campus in Trivandrum, Kerala, India, on 12—13 February 2025 following the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the two organizations in January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visit and technical discussions mark an important milestone in facilitating the transfer of selected technologies from institutions with a public health mandate to HTAP and subsequently to suitable manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTAP’s mission is to bridge the health technology access gap by providing an evidence-driven mechanism for selecting, securing and facilitating the geo-diversified transfer of existing technologies. In the long run, it also seeks to build end-to-end product development capacity in LMICs through global and regional health technology consortia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussions focused on potential technology candidates and key areas for potential collaboration, including education and training, technology transfer and the business incubation unit designed to allow small startups the opportunity to develop projects, informed by interactions with SCTIMST scientists, if requested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCTIMST is a unique publicly funded institution that carries research and development of prioritized medical technologies all the way to proof of concept while also providing the necessary support for technology transfer. Fields of research discussed in detail during the visit include biomaterials, biomedical engineering, in vitro diagnostics,&amp;nbsp;other medical devices&amp;nbsp;and assistive technologies, which&amp;nbsp;jointly contribute to&amp;nbsp;a growing list of technologies that have now been commercialized in India and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MOU with SCTIMST will support HTAP’s vision of establishing a global network of public institutions that could provide technologies under transparent, non-exclusive licenses, addressing critical access gaps in underserved regions. This effort is guided by a robust prioritization process that considers both need and the likelihood of success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A two-year workplan is currently being developed to translate the objectives of the MoU into concrete, actionable activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTAP, which builds on lessons learned from the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP), remains focused on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. At the same time, it promotes access to health products that address existing public health priorities by actively targeting platform technologies and other essential health products relevant both during and beyond health emergencies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/headquarters/initiatives/health-technology-access-pool-(htap)/technical-discussions-on-technology-transfer-with-who-htap-and-sctimst-delegations-and-agappe.jpg?sfvrsn=eaf976a6_4\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;Photo" of="" delegations="" during="" the="" meeting\"="" sf-size="\&amp;quot;628423\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;br&gt;From left to right: Dr Anoop Kumar, Scientist, molecular medicine, SCTIMST, Dr Madhur Gupta, Technical officer, WHO Country Office for India, Mr Einstein Kesi, Medical device expert, WHO HTAP, Dr Dragana Milic, Diagnostics and medical device expert, WHO HTAP, Mr Michael Ward, Senior technical specialist, WHO HTAP, Mr Jofy Paul, Vice president, R&amp;amp;D-Reagent, Agappe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/headquarters/initiatives/health-technology-access-pool-(htap)/who-htap-and-sctimst-delegations-meet-to-strengthen-collaboration.jpg?sfvrsn=bccc93f7_2\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;697035\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;br&gt;From&amp;nbsp;left to right:&amp;nbsp;Mr Einstein Kesi, Medical device expert, WHO HTAP, Dr Roy Joseph, Scientist, Polymeric medical devices, SCTIMST, Dr Sanjay Behari, Director, SCTIMST, Dr Anoop Kumar, Scientist, molecular medicine, SCTIMST, Mr Michael Ward, Senior technical specialist, WHO HTAP, Dr Madhur Gupta, Technical officer, WHO Country Office for India, Dr Jayasree RS, Scientist, biophotonics and imaging, SCTIMST, Mr Nagesh DS, Scientist, extracorporeal devices, SCTIMST, Dr Manikandan S, Deputy director, SCTIMST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//26-02-2025-new-who-partnership-with-indian-institute-to-advance-technology-transfer-and-health-equity</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//26-02-2025-new-who-partnership-with-indian-institute-to-advance-technology-transfer-and-health-equity</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 12:33:49 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>WHO unveils updated global database of air quality standards</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.swisstph.ch/en//%22"&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;text-decoration:underline;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.swisstph.ch/en//%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH)&lt;/a&gt;, has unveiled the updated 2025 Air Quality Standards database. This resource compiles national air quality standards for major pollutants and other airborne toxics from countries worldwide. This latest update provides an overview of global efforts towards achieving the WHO global air quality guidelines, with 17% more countries now implementing standards for pollutants that pose a risk to human health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The updated WHO Air Quality Standards database is a crucial tool highlighting global progress in setting air quality regulations to protect public health,\" says Dr Maria Neira, Director, Environment, Climate Change and Health at the World Health Organization. “It provides essential data for evidence based policymaking, helping to reduce air pollutions impacts on communities worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on previous efforts, the updated database now includes data from approximately 140 countries from all WHO regions, showcasing their air pollution regulatory efforts aimed at protecting public health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The database is presented as an interactive tool, providing values for both the short and long-term standards for particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;and PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and carbon monoxide (CO). These values are based on averaging times that align with WHO’s global air quality guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO air quality guidelines as a tool to protect health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO guidelines were published in 2021 to reflect new evidence of the health effects of air pollution. The guidelines recommend lower air quality levels to protect populations, underscoring the need for countries to implement stricter standards and policies to mitigate air pollution and its associated health risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health sector has a critical role to play to promote public health protection through effective air quality governance. Involving the health community in the development of national air quality standards as well as in processes ensuring that air quality standards are embedded in legislation is key to maximize public health protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopting air quality standards as best buys to prevent noncommunicable diseases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental risks account for a quarter of the disease burden worldwide – with air pollution alone being responsible for almost 7 million deaths. Many of these deaths are preventable through policies in the energy, transport, agriculture, household, industry and other sectors. Air pollution has been recognized as a major risk for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), impacting not only the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, but many more other organs and systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The costs of air pollution on the health systems are substantial, and it jeopardizes the health of the most vulnerable such as children, who are affected throughout their entire life course, as well as people with pre-existing diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By compiling national air quality standards into a single, comprehensive database, WHO aims to empower stakeholders such policy makers, public health officials, researchers and other civil society and health organizations with the information necessary to monitor progress, drive policy changes and support the implementation of effective interventions to improve air quality and safeguard public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time to commit for clean air and health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopting stricter air quality standards embedded in legislation is the first step – a required best buy – countries can do to commit to combat NCDs and other health outcomes. The upcoming 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;WHO Conference on Air Pollution and Health will provide an opportunity for countries to commit to tackling air pollution, supported by the health community &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/call-for-clean-air-action//%22"&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;text-decoration:underline;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/call-for-clean-air-action/%22"&gt;call for clean air action&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//26-02-2025-who-unveils-updated-global-database-of-air-quality-standards</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//26-02-2025-who-unveils-updated-global-database-of-air-quality-standards</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>WHO strengthens support for grassroots crowdsourcing campaign: a global movement of unity and solidarity</title><description>&lt;p&gt;What started as a grassroots initiative by a WHO staff member has grown into a global movement for health. Building on the success of the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://whofoundation.donorsupport.co/page/FUNEKRBXNHP/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;1 Dollar 1 World campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the World Health Organization (WHO) is now amplifying and evolving the initiative to encourage more people around the world to show their solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by an individual’s initiative, WHO is now backing the 1 Dollar 1 World movement, encouraging regions, countries, champions, and its own workforce to unite behind the effort. Together with the WHO Foundation, WHO will strengthen its efforts to create awareness about its critical work and engage communities worldwide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this initiative, WHO is embracing a new approach by leveraging crowdfunding to support its mission. For the first time, WHO is activating its existing infrastructure – spanning 150 country offices – alongside the WHO Foundation’s reach, to amplify this grassroots movement. This strategic shift not only strengthens community engagement but also aligns with WHO’s broader strategy to diversify funding sources and support its ongoing Investment Round.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its launch in early 2025, almost 5000 people from over 140 countries have contributed to the campaign through the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://who.foundation//%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;WHO Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, created to bring together funders and high impact health initiatives to further the mission of WHO. The high level of success and engagement demonstrates that there is a broad sense of solidarity and shared commitment to global health. This campaign is not just about crowdfunding – it’s about people standing together to remind us that health is a right, not a privilege.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;“The power of the 1 Dollar, 1 World movement comes from the people. In particular, I would like to thank my colleague Tania Cernuschi for her inspiration to launch this initiative,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “It shows that in times of crisis, people everywhere can unite and commit to protecting and promoting the health of others. WHO is proud to stand behind this initiative, which embodies the values of solidarity, action, innovation and hope.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A moment for action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenges global health has faced in recent years – from pandemics to humanitarian crises – make it clearer than ever that no one is safe until everyone is safe. The 1 Dollar 1 World movement is a chance for people everywhere to turn concern into action and show that solidarity, just like health, knows no borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This campaign started with one person, but it belongs to all of us,” said Tania Cernuschi, the WHO staff member who launched the original initiative. “It’s proof that individuals can make a difference, and that together, we are stronger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join the movement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media and the public are invited to support and share this movement. Every action – whether a donation, a post, or a conversation – helps spread the message that health should be for all, not just for some. Every stakeholder – whether a person, an organization, a community or a government – has a role in building efficient and effective collaboration for health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A grassroots campaign with global impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1 Dollar 1 World movement invites everyone to take action for global health in three simple ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://whofoundation.donorsupport.co/page/FUNEKRBXNHP/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Donate&lt;/a&gt; through the WHO Foundation – Every dollar counts.

The commitment highlights Saudi Arabia’s role in combatting polio, particularly in conflict-affected regions such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Gaza, where the virus has made a resurgence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read Press Release: &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://polioeradication.org/news/kingdom-of-saudi-arabia-confirms-us-500-million-commitment-to-global-polio-eradication-effort//%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" title="\&amp;quot;https://polioeradication.org/news/kingdom-of-saudi-arabia-confirms-us-500-million-commitment-to-global-polio-eradication-effort/\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Kingdom of Saudi Arabia confirms US$ 500 million commitment to global polio eradication effort&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Riyadh International Humanitarian Forum 2025 was a significant event that underscored the continued partnership between WHO and KSrelief, as well as with other international partners to address critical humanitarian health crises.

Each year, it draws attention to a specific health topic of concern to people all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The focus of this campaign comes at a crucial moment, aiming to help countries regain lost progress while showcasing new research and evidence that will enhance the health of women and babies globally,” said Dr Anshu Banerjee, Director of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and Ageing at WHO. “As rollbacks to humanitarian assistance jeopardize a critical lifeline for millions, it will also be an opportunity to step up support and collaboration for global health - and deliver hope to those in urgent need of lifesaving care.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping every woman and baby survive and thrive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the most recent estimates, close to 300 000 women lose their life due to pregnancy or childbirth each year; over 2 million babies die in their first month of life, and around 2 million more are stillborn. This is roughly 1 preventable death every 7 seconds – losses which bring tremendous sadness and heartache to millions of families around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While maternal and newborn deaths occur in all regions, the vast majority are in the poorest countries and those facing conflict and other crises. When health care facilities close, facilities are attacked, access routes denied or supplies disrupted, pregnant women and babies - who need regular access to health services - face severe, often life-threatening risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on current trends, a staggering 4 out of 5 countries are off track to meet the United Nations’ global targets for improving maternal survival by 2030; 1 in 3 will fail to meet targets for reducing newborn deaths. Current funding constraints could further jeopardize progress, as many programmes providing critical health services have stalled alongside important medical research focused on pregnant and breastfeeding women and children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s campaign, which will run until 2026, will urge governments, donors and the health community to invest in proven, high-impact interventions, as part of efforts to improve overall quality of care. These include pregnancy related services to detect complications and lifesaving emergency obstetrics – noting that the vast majority of maternal and newborn deaths happen during or shortly after birth – as well as special care for small and preterm babies. Complications relating to prematurity are now the leading cause of death of children under-5 worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO will also highlight the evolving need for health systems to address the many underlying health issues that impact maternal and newborn health. These include not only direct obstetric complications but also mental health conditions, malnutrition (including under and overnutrition as well as nutritional deficiencies), and an increasing burden of noncommunicable diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listening to women and supporting families&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moving beyond actions to save lives, the campaign will urge increased global attention to women’s longer-term health and well-being. This includes advocating for laws and policies that safeguard their health and rights, such as paid maternity leave and other critical employment protections, and access to vital family planning services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is not sufficient that women survive childbirth, they must also be able to enjoy their lives in good health,” said Dr Pascale Allotey, Director for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research at WHO. “Women and girls everywhere need access to health providers who listen to their concerns and meet their needs, while ensuring they can plan their fertility, take charge of their futures, and protect their health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Efforts are also needed to address &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/news/item/05-06-2024-experts-warn-of-serious-health-impacts-from-climate-change-for-pregnant-women--children--and-older-people/%22"&gt;the particular risks of climate change&lt;/a&gt; for pregnant women and newborns,&amp;nbsp; as evidence shows an association between higher temperatures and preterm births, stillbirth, hypertension and gestational diabetes, as well as infant mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An investment, not a cost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In low- and middle-income countries, every US$1 invested in maternal and newborn health &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://pmnch.who.int/resources/publications/m/item/investing-in-maternal-newborn-and-child-health/%22"&gt;is estimated&lt;/a&gt; to yield around US$9 to 20 in return. Evidence shows that spending on maternal and newborn health leads to economic development and happier, healthier societies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the world, WHO is supporting essential maternal and newborn health programmes including through:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intensive support to 55 countries through the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://ewene.org//%22"&gt;Every Woman Every Newborn Everywhere initiative&lt;/a&gt;, which is working to expand access to lifesaving emergency obstetric and newborn care units, family planning and other critical services;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Guidance relating to diverse aspects of maternal and newborn health through pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period. &amp;nbsp;New recommendations will be published later this year to help clinicians manage &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/teams/sexual-and-reproductive-health-and-research-(srh)/areas-of-work/maternal-and-perinatal-health/postpartum-haemorrhage/%22"&gt;postpartum haemorrhage&lt;/a&gt;, one of the world’s leading causes of maternal deaths, and noncommunicable diseases in pregnancy;

Through strong partnerships and countries’ commitments vaccines have reached every corner of the world and became the single greatest contribution of any health intervention to ensuring babies not only see their first birthdays but continue leading healthy lives into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2025 marks a significant turning point for immunization efforts worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/events/detail/2024/01/01/default-calendar/50th-anniversary-of-the-expanded-programme-on-immunization-(epi)/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;"&gt;we celebrated&lt;/a&gt; the remarkable progress made by the global immunization community since 1974. Each year, new and under-utilized vaccines continue to be introduced in countries. In 2024, four new countries introduced HPV vaccines and 25 adopted the single-dose schedule. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news/item/12-04-2024-in-world-first--nigeria-introduces-new-5-in-1-vaccine-against-meningitis/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;"&gt;Niger and Nigeria became the first countries to implement the Men5CV vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, a new and affordable meningococcal pentavalent conjugate vaccine, and more than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/feature-stories/detail/life-saving-malaria-vaccines-reach-children-in-17-endemic-countries-in-2024/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;"&gt;12 million doses of malaria vaccine &lt;/a&gt;reached 17 countries in Africa in 2024 – a pivotal moment in the fight to end malaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789240075511/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;"&gt;Big Catch-up Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, a major vaccine co-financing initiative in collaboration with Gavi and UNICEF, began reaching children left unvaccinated as a result the pandemic. By the end of 2024, an estimated 143 million vaccine doses had been delivered to 36 countries and 10.5 million catch-up doses had already been administered. This year, an additional 104 million doses will be delivered as part of the Big Catch-up, and a new WHO global monitoring dashboard is enabling real-time data tracking to continually strengthen countries strategies and our support to them. The midway point of the Immunization Agenda 2030 is upon us. As we look towards the next five years there are challenges ahead, but the goal is more relevant than ever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;text-decoration:underline;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Five immunization priorities for 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equity: Reaching Zero-Dose Children&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine equity remains one of the most urgent global health challenges of our time. While immunization programs have made tremendous progress, millions of children worldwide remain unreached—many of whom are classified as zero-dose children, meaning they have not received a single vaccine. In 2023, 14.5 million children had received no vaccines at all, a sharp increase from 12.9 million in 2019. These children are disproportionately from marginalized communities, including those in conflict zones, remote areas, and urban slums. The gap in coverage not only fuels preventable disease outbreaks but also deepens existing inequalities in health outcomes. Closing this gap requires targeted strategies: improving supply chains, strengthening healthcare infrastructure, and addressing socioeconomic barriers that prevent families from accessing vaccination services. Achieving true equity means ensuring that no child is left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outbreaks: The Resurgence of Measles and System Strengthening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine-Preventable Disease surveillance is another pillar of global health security. From yellow fever to measles to pneumonia, early detection ensures vaccines reach those who need them most. The alarming rise in measles cases is a stark reminder of result when immunization networks are weakened. Once considered on the path to elimination in many regions, measles is resurging due to gaps in vaccine coverage. This increase is a warning signal that vaccination systems are at risk—delayed campaigns, supply chain disruptions, and weakened trust in health services have created the basis for outbreaks. Strengthening immunization programmes is not just about responding to crises but about intense work to build resilient health systems so those crises are averted in the first place. This means enhancing surveillance, ensuring robust stockpiles of vaccines, training health workers, assuring data systems are in place to drive impact and intensifying essential immunization services. A failure to act decisively now could see other vaccine-preventable diseases following the same dangerous trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccine Confidence: Strengthening Trust Among Communities and Health Workers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confidence in vaccines is the backbone of successful immunization efforts. The past few years have exposed both the strengths and vulnerabilities of public trust in vaccines. Misinformation, historical mistrust, and political instability threaten to erode hard-won gains. At the same time, frontline health workers—the trusted faces of vaccination—must be supported with training and resources to confidently engage with communities. Trust must be built through transparency, education, and engagement. Governments, civil society, and the private sector must work together to counter misinformation and misrepresentation, amplify accurate information, and ensure that communities feel empowered, not coerced, in vaccine decision-making. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Vaccines: Innovation, Hope, and the Need for Strong Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innovation in vaccines brings immense opportunity for tackling some of the world’s deadliest diseases. The introduction of new vaccines—whether for malaria, RSV, or the next pandemic threat—represents a turning point in public health. &amp;nbsp;New vaccines are only as impactful as the systems that deliver them. The success of these vaccines hinges not just on their development but on their effective introduction and sustained delivery. This is where our role supporting countries is critical: ensuring that regulatory approvals, financing mechanisms, health system readiness, and community acceptance are in place. Investing in the introduction of these vaccines with the same urgency as their research and development will be key to translating scientific breakthroughs into real-world protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding and political challengers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order indicating the United States’ intent to withdraw from WHO. We remain hopeful that the US will reconsider. For decades, the partnership between the US and WHO has been instrumental in achieving historic public health milestones—from the eradication of smallpox to advancing global immunization efforts that have saved millions of lives in the US and around the world. This collaboration has protected Americans at home and abroad through disease surveillance, accelerating scientific progress, and ensuring that life-saving health interventions reach those who need them most, and shutting down outbreaks when they emerge, to limit their impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global health security is a shared responsibility. Infectious diseases do not respect borders, and the challenges we face—whether responding to outbreaks, developing new vaccines, or ensuring equitable access to healthcare—require international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO remains committed to its mission and will continue working with partners to strengthen global health systems. Strong leadership and sustained funding are critical to ensuring immunization programmes remain resilient. However, the political landscape for vaccines is increasingly unpredictable, putting decades of progress at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving Forward Together: A Moment for Global Health Cooperation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two upcoming meetings will be pivotal in providing critical guidance for future immunization policies and strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/events/detail/2025/03/10/default-calendar/strategic-advisory-group-of-experts-on-immunization-march-2025/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;"&gt;Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE)&lt;/a&gt; will meet 10-13 March 2025, to advance global immunization policies and priorities. Key discussions will focus on IA2030 progress, pneumococcus vaccine schedules, varicella-zoster vaccination, new vaccine introductions, NITAG strengthening, and global polio eradication policy decisions and mpox updates. The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/events/detail/2025/03/25/default-calendar/sixth-global-vaccine-and-immunization-research-forum-(gvirf)/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;"&gt;Global Vaccine and Immunization Research Forum &lt;/a&gt;(March 25-27, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) will convene experts from around the world to advance vaccine innovations, sustainable R&amp;amp;D investments, Artificial Intelligence applications to vaccine development, climate-related challenges to immunization, and equitable access to vaccines. Key discussions will highlight Latin American advancements, maternal and new TB vaccines, vaccine role to reduce antimicrobial resistance, and clinical trial innovations for immunization.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In closing, I want to thank Member States, partners, and all those in the global health community for the resilient commitment and focus on immunization, driven always by high quality evidence, science and impact. Now is the time to remain committed and sharpen our focus so that immunization for all is a reality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world has the tools, knowledge, and capacity to protect future generations through vaccines. Political will and global solidarity are more valuable than ever to make that happen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the words of Dr. Albert Sabin, \"A scientist who is also a human being cannot rest while knowledge which might be used to reduce suffering rests on the shelf.\" Let’s ensure that decades of progress are not left behind, but are built upon. It is in our hands. It is Humanly Possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;----&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://confirmsubscription.com/h/d/4BC833B1BCA2AAC0/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe to the Global Immunization Newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="\&amp;quot;2076995910\&amp;quot;" paraeid="\&amp;quot;{b8478662-e542-4234-9619-cf81406a2667}{184}\&amp;quot;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//20-02-2025-message-by-the-director-of-the-department-of-immunization--vaccines-and-biologicals-at-who---january-february-2025</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//20-02-2025-message-by-the-director-of-the-department-of-immunization--vaccines-and-biologicals-at-who---january-february-2025</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 13:19:40 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>Mass polio vaccination campaign to continue in the Gaza Strip</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The emergency polio outbreak response in the Gaza Strip is continuing, with a mass vaccination campaign scheduled from 22 to 26 February 2025. The novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) will be administered to over 591 000 children under 10 years of age to protect them from polio. This campaign follows the recent detection of poliovirus in wastewater samples in Gaza, signaling ongoing circulation in the environment, putting children at risk.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pockets of individuals with low or no immunity provide the virus an opportunity to continue spreading and potentially cause disease. The current environment in Gaza, including overcrowding in shelters and severely damaged water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure, which facilitates fecal-oral transmission, create ideal conditions for further spread of poliovirus. Extensive population movement consequent to the current ceasefire is likely to exacerbate the spread of poliovirus infection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two previous vaccination rounds in the Gaza Strip were successfully conducted in September and October 2024, reaching over 95% of the target. As poliovirus is found to remain in the environment, additional vaccination efforts are needed to reach every child and strengthen population immunity. The presence of the virus still poses a risk to children with low or no immunity, in Gaza and throughout the region. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, health workers faced significant challenges accessing certain areas of central, north and south Gaza, which required special coordination to enter during the conflict. In inaccessible areas such as Jabalia, Beit Lahiya, and Beit Hanoun, where humanitarian pauses for the vaccination campaign were not assured, approximately 7 000 children missed vaccination during the second round. The recent ceasefire means health workers have considerably better access now. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No additional polio cases have been reported since a ten-month-old child was paralyzed in August 2024, but the new environmental samples from Deir al Balah and Khan Younis, collected in December 2024 and January 2025, confirm poliovirus transmission. The strain detected is genetically linked to the poliovirus detected in the Gaza Strip in July 2024.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upcoming vaccination campaign aims to reach all children under 10 years of age, including those previously missed, to close immunity gaps and end the outbreak.

As Africans in particular and as active members of the international community, we must celebrate this milestone. Every decision made here must translate into lives saved,\" said Mr. Abdessamad Kayouh, Minister of Transport and Logistics of the Kingdom of Morocco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key commitments made at the conference include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thailand’s pledge to bring road deaths down to 12 per 100,000 people by 2027.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bangladesh will enact the country’s first national road safety law.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saudi Arabia will update the country’s national road safety strategy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colombia will ensure more cities will have speed limits of 50kmh and 30kmh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Guinea will ratify the African Charter on Road Safety and align regulations with international standards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cote d’ivoire aims to increase helmet wearing among motorcyclists to 90% by 2027.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The United Kingdom will produce its first national road safety strategy in over a decade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Concrete commitments to move further and faster to save lives and boost road safety are just what we need to meet the goal of halving road deaths by 2030, and we’ve achieved that here. We commend the countries that made these commitments and we thank the Kingdom of Morocco for their leadership in hosting this crucial event. WHO is here to assist all countries in preventing deaths on the roads,” said Dr Etienne Krug, WHO Director for the Department of the Social Determinants of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Marrakech Declaration calls for safety to be a primary concern in all road infrastructure planning and related policies, laws and regulations. It calls for greater coordination across government ministries, including health, transport and the environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The declaration urges governments to adopt policies and infrastructure that advance safe, green and equitable mobility, such as walking, cycling and public transport. It recognizes that safe and accessible mobility drives equitable economic growth across society.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The declaration also calls for more cross-border knowledge-sharing, technical support and technology transfer, and to advance research into emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). It highlights the need to work with civil society and academia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//19-02-2025-global-leaders-make-new-road-safety-commitments--endorse-new-declaration-on-action-to-reduce-road-deaths</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//19-02-2025-global-leaders-make-new-road-safety-commitments--endorse-new-declaration-on-action-to-reduce-road-deaths</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>WHO launches new technical brief on encephalitis</title><description>&lt;p&gt;WHO has published a new technical brief on  &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240106475/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" data-sf-marked="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;encephalitis&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;, a serious, life-threatening neurological condition characterized by inflammation of the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encephalitis affects people across all age groups, has high mortality and often leads to significant long-term complications (sequelae) including hearing loss, seizures, limb weakness, and difficulties with vision, speech, language, memory and communication. Globally in 2021, encephalitis was the fourth leading cause of neurological health loss (i.e. disability-adjusted life years, DALYs) in children aged under 5&amp;nbsp;years and the 13th across all age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many different pathogens can cause encephalitis. Herpes simplex (HSV) is the most common cause of encephalitis globally. Autoimmune encephalitis, an inflammatory brain disorder driven by the immune system, is also increasingly recognized as a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some pathogens are spread by mosquitoes and ticks (vector-transmitted). Others can be prevented by vaccines, including influenza, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), rabies, poliomyelitis and encephalitis linked to measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). Some pathogens, like Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), are both transmitted by vectors and can be prevented through vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encephalitis is a growing global concern due to population density, intensive farming, climate change, vaccine hesitancy, and human-animal proximity, especially in under-resourced communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical brief, which forms part of the implementation of the broader &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240076624/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders&lt;/a&gt; (IGAP), draws attention to the lack of access to essential care, especially in low-and middle-income countries.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, people living with encephalitis and associated disabilities continue to have difficulties accessing treatment and rehabilitation, and many also experience discrimination and human rights violations, further underscoring the need for urgent action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brief covers the diagnosis, treatment and care of encephalitis (i.e. care pathways; diagnosis; treatment; care, including social protection and welfare; rehabilitation; and an interdisciplinary workforce). It also addresses surveillance and prevention (i.e. vaccines and vector control), and research, advocacy and awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Encephalitis is a growing public health challenge, and by prioritizing it within global and national health agendas and strengthening collaboration, we can reduce its impact and save lives,\" said Dr Tarun Dua, Head of the Brain Health Unit, WHO. \"These efforts will not only improve health outcomes and quality of life for those affected and their families but also result in stronger more resilient health systems.” &lt;/p&gt;This technical brief is based on evidence from a WHO-commissioned scoping review &amp;nbsp;and discussions held at a WHO-convened meeting, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240069176/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Why encephalitis matters?&lt;/a&gt; with people with lived experience and carers, academics, researchers and service providers.  &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="\&amp;quot;_com_1\&amp;quot;" language="\&amp;quot;JavaScript\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="\&amp;quot;_com_3\&amp;quot;" language="\&amp;quot;JavaScript\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//17-02-2025-who-launches-new-technical-brief-on-encephalitis</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//17-02-2025-who-launches-new-technical-brief-on-encephalitis</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 15:20:53 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>World leaders gather to reduce road deaths, boost road safety</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Leaders, ministers and officials from over 100 countries are set to advance commitments and actions to strengthen road safety worldwide at the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.roadsafetymorocco.com//%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Fourth Global Ministerial Conference on Road safety&lt;/a&gt; that will be hosted by the Kingdom of Morocco and the World Health Organization (WHO] in Marrakech this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaders are set to endorse the ‘Marrakech Declaration on Global Road Safety’ which urges countries to make road safety a political priority and boost&amp;nbsp;actions to achieve the goal of halving global road deaths by 2030 as set out in the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021-2030 and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Road crashes kill nearly 1.2 million people each year, which is more than two deaths every minute. Road crashes cost most countries around 3 to 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP) and transport accounts for around a quarter of the world’s harmful greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Road safety is a priority for people, planet and prosperity. It underpins individual opportunity and sustainable development globally. The Marrakech Declaration calls for a step-change in efforts to reduce road deaths and ensure safe and sustainable mobility for everyone. No road deaths are ever acceptable, or necessary, and we must double-down on our efforts to apply proven solutions,” said Mr Abdessamad Kayouh, Minister of Transport and Logistics for the Kingdom of Morocco.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Marrakech Declaration calls on governments to implement all recommendations set out in the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/global-plan-for-the-decade-of-action-for-road-safety-2021-2030/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021-2030&lt;/a&gt;, including strengthening laws, safety regulations and coordination across government. The Global Plan calls for more cross-border knowledge-sharing, technical support, technology transfer and research into emerging technologies, as well as efforts to make walking, cycling and public transport more accessible for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Road deaths are preventable and making roads safe for everyone is within our reach. We know what to do, and this conference marks a clear call to urgent action. Leaders are making new commitments and advancing actions&amp;nbsp;to save more lives but much more still needs to be done,” said Dr Etienne Krug, WHO Director of the Department for the Social Determinants of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/teams/social-determinants-of-health/safety-and-mobility/global-status-report-on-road-safety-2023/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;WHO Global Status Report on Road Safety (2023)&lt;/a&gt; shows that road deaths fell slightly to 1.19 million per year in 2021, which was a 5% reduction in fatalities since 2010. More than half of all UN Member States reported a decline in deaths over this period and 10 of these countries managed to halve deaths in the last 10 years, showing that a 50% reduction in a decade is possible. 35 of these countries reduced the number of deaths by between 30 and 50% between 2010 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fourth Global Ministerial Conference on Road Safety takes place in Marrakech, Morocco on 18-20 February, with the theme of \"Commit to Life\". Around 2500 delegates, including ministers, heads of national road safety agencies, government representatives, parliamentarians and experts from the United Nations, civil society, business and academia are attending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus areas for the conference include road safety governance, emerging trends in mobility, financing, working with the private sector, road traffic injury data, connections with other health, transport, environment and development agendas, and as the first-ever Global Ministerial Conference on Road Safety to be held on the African continent, a focus on Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO is hosting and participating in a series of events at the conference, including a meeting of the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/news/item/11-02-2025-heads-of-road-safety-agencies-meeting-to-drive-down-road-deaths/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Global Network of Heads of National Road Safety Agencies&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with the World Bank, and sessions on road safety governance, data, legislation and enforcement and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/news/item/04-02-2025-new-study-reveals-vital-insights-into-road-safety-news-coverage-in-africa/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;strategic communications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//16-02-2025-world-leaders-gather-to-reduce-road-deaths--boost-road-safety</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//16-02-2025-world-leaders-gather-to-reduce-road-deaths--boost-road-safety</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 15:10:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>Guiding maternal and perinatal health research during global pandemics</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN Special Programme in Human Reproduction (HRP) have a new plan to enhance the health and well-being of pregnant women and their babies in the wake of infectious disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few decades, the world has continuously grappled with epidemics of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 and influenza; mosquito-borne viral diseases including Zika and Oropouche; and haemorrhagic fevers including Ebola and Marburg virus disease and mpox. These epidemics have significantly impacted women and their babies. However, it is important to know more about how disease outbreaks affect these populations in order to create informed policies, as well as clinical guidance for effective prevention and treatment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly launched &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789240096318/%22"&gt;Roadmap for research on maternal and perinatal health in the context of epidemic threats&lt;/a&gt; provides a comprehensive strategy to address the unique challenges pregnant women and babies face during epidemics. The Roadmap seeks to fill gaps in what we know by fostering thorough research, the sharing of findings and by delivering actionable solutions to improve outcomes for women and their babies during health emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Roadmap is grounded in a vision of a world where every pregnant woman and baby, no matter where they live or their economic situation, receives the highest standard of care during and after pregnancy – even in the most challenging of times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Four key areas for action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Roadmap calls on a wide range of stakeholders – including researchers, policymakers, health workers, international organizations and community advocates – to join forces in four main strategic areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;improve coordination and collaboration: streamlining global research efforts to ensure effective use of resources, enhance surveillance, and share knowledge;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;advocate for change: raising awareness, securing funding and partnerships to prioritize the health and well-being of pregnant women and their babies during epidemics;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;build research and surveillance capacity: enhancing skills, tools and infrastructure to better study how epidemics impact pregnant women and their babies, and generate high-quality evidence - including through standardized outcome measurement; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;optimize timely use of evidence: by disseminating and encouraging wide accessibility and use of scientific knowledge by policymakers, health workers, researchers and women themselves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development of this Roadmap followed a rigorous, systematic process, including comprehensive &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://gh.bmj.com/content/9/3/e014393/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;analyses &lt;/a&gt;of existing maternal and perinatal health research, and several consultative meetings with a wide range of stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO and HRP work to generate the evidence needed to better understand the effects of epidemics on women’s health, women’s perceptions and needs, and to improve relevant health system responses. Guided by this Roadmap, and in strong collaboration with all stakeholders, they will advance research, offer technical support to countries and develop guidance so that sexual and reproductive health services can be prioritized when emergencies occur.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//14-02-2025-guiding-maternal-and-perinatal-health-research-during-global-pandemics</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//14-02-2025-guiding-maternal-and-perinatal-health-research-during-global-pandemics</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>WHO releases 2025 update to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) has released the 2025 edition of the International Classification of Diseases 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Revision (ICD-11) – a tool that standardizes the language used by health professionals worldwide in diagnosing, reporting and monitoring diseases, injuries and causes of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The update includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;new features designed to improve interoperability, accuracy and ease of use in national health systems (e.g. advanced NLP and API-based coding);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;improved error detection with enhanced spelling correction and language variation recognition, reducing errors in data entry;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;multilingual expansion, available in &lt;strong&gt;14 languages&lt;/strong&gt;, with ongoing expansion to improve global accessibility;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;interoperability with external standards: ICD-11 seamlessly integrates with Orphanet, MedDRA, and other terminologies and classifications; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a new module covering traditional medicine conditions of Ayurveda and related traditional medicine systems, including Siddha and Unani, will enable systematic tracking of traditional medicine services, enhancing global research, reporting and evidence-based policymaking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ICD is a flagship WHO product that serves as the basis for identifying health trends and statistics at country level and worldwide. ICD is at the foundation of WHO's Fourteenth General Programme of Work efforts to accelerate progress towards health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), addressing inequalities and achieving relevant national health targets. Every day, vital and life-saving decisions in clinical, administrative, policy and research settings are guided by the common terminology defined in ICD-11.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICD-11 also influences the availability of financial protection and social insurance, as health insurers’ reimbursements depend on ICD coding. Moreover, the classification of diseases has an immeasurable impact on how society’s views and behaviours towards diseases and health conditions are shaped; how people seek and receive health care; how providers respond; and what policies surround the provision of care. For example, when diseases of the immune system were re-classified and given more focus in ICD-11, it helped health practitioners address autoimmune disorders based on the most current knowledge and evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A digital future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICD-11 enhances global health communication by providing a standardized classification and terminology for seamless integration across health information systems, languages and settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the new updates, the ICD-11 offers more ease of use, improved interoperability and accuracy, which will benefit national health systems and the people they serve,” said Dr Robert Jakob, Team Leader, Classifications and Terminologies Unit, WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICD-11 is designed for flexibility when working in non-digital settings, while its 2025 edition facilitates countries to embrace digital innovation and enhance their health systems. The 2025 edition of ICD-11 takes is a major step forward with FHIR API integration and advanced natural language processing (NLP). These innovations enable seamless, real-time data exchange across health systems, making coding faster, more accurate, and less disruptive to patient care. With this&amp;nbsp;intuitive design and smarter automation, health workers can focus on what matters most, while training requires fewer resources and less time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With every annual update, ICD-11 further reflects progress in science and medicine on which billions of people across the world rely for their health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ICD-11 is now available in 14 languages and expansion is underway to further improve global accessibility.

These therapies can offer significant benefits in efficacy, safety, and convenience, compared to conventional medicines. However, their high costs have limited accessibility for many patients globally. Biosimilar versions of biologic medicines are now helping to change this landscape by providing more affordable treatment options, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where the burden of disease is high, and healthcare budgets are constrained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding biosimilars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biologics are complex medicines derived from living organisms. Their complex manufacturing processes have traditionally limited their availability, primarily serving high-income countries. In recent years, biopharmaceutical manufacturing capacity has grown faster in middle-income countries, increasing the potential for broader access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biosimilars are highly similar versions of biologic medicines, developed through comprehensive analytical studies and rigorous preclinical and clinical trials to ensure therapeutic equivalence. These products offer equally effective and safe alternatives thereby increasing market competition and reducing the costs of biologic therapies (1). Biosimilars are about 60 % cheaper than their originator counterparts (2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biosimilars offer significant cost savings, which can expand access to essential biologic therapies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHO’s role in promoting biosimilars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes biosimilars as key drivers for expanding global access to essential biological medicines. Through its Essential Medicines List (EML), WHO evaluates and includes quality-assured biosimilars, endorsing them as safe, effective, and cost-effective alternatives to originator biologics. The WHO prequalification of biosimilars builds confidence for their procurement by the United Nation (UN) agencies and countries, enhancing their availability and affordability. WHO also advocates for non-exclusive voluntary licensing to accelerate affordable biosimilar access and emphasizes the importance of regulatory harmonization, healthcare professional education, and stakeholder collaboration in promoting biosimilar use (3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Standards for biological products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since early 1950s’ WHO has played a pivotal role in establishing norms and standards for biological products. These standards ensure the consistent quality, safety, and efficacy of biological medicines and related in vitro biological diagnostic tests worldwide. The WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization (ECBS) collaborates with international scientific and professional communities, regional and national regulatory authorities, manufacturers, and expert laboratories to develop these standards based on international consensus. WHO guidelines and recommendations for biological products cover various aspects, including production, control, and regulatory preparedness. This guidance is crucial for maintaining high standards in the development and use of biological products, including biosimilars. For instance, the guidelines on the quality, safety, and efficacy of biotherapeutic products provide a framework for evaluating biosimilars at country level, ensuring they meet the same rigorous standards as their reference products. WHO also establishes International Biological Reference Materials, which serve as benchmarks for the quality and potency of biological products (i.e. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/biologicals/blood-products/catalogue/who-catalogue-with-ecbs-link_mhra.pdf?sfvrsn=fc055271_3\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;WHO International Reference Standards for Biological Products&lt;/a&gt;). These reference materials are essential for standardizing assays and ensuring the comparability of biosimilar products across different regions and manufacturers. WHO emphasizes the importance of regulatory harmonization to facilitate the global adoption of biosimilars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Biosimilars in the EML: bridging the gap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 2023, the WHO EML includes 81 biologic therapies, representing over 15% of all listed essential medicines. The inclusion of biosimilars on the EML helps bridge the gap in affordability and availability of these therapies. For example, following the EML recommendation and WHO prequalification of trastuzumab and rituximab biosimilars treatment costs for breast cancer and lymphoma have significantly reduced. Countries such as Brazil (4), India (5), and South Africa (6) have successfully expanded patient access through approved biosimilars, demonstrating the practical benefits of these inclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Evolution of biologic medicines in the EML &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recognizes the importance of expanding access to essential biologic medicines globally. In 2013, bevacizumab (recommended for age-related macular degeneration, a disease of the eye) was the first monoclonal antibody added to the WHO EML, followed by trastuzumab and rituximab in 2015, both indicated against cancer. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trastuzumab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;has revolutionized breast cancer treatment for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. Since its introduction almost 25 years ago, trastuzumab has significantly improved outcomes for patients with this type of cancer. It is a monoclonal antibody that targets the HER2 protein, which is overexpressed in some breast cancers, and it has been pivotal in reducing recurrence and improving survival rates. Trastuzumab's impact is reflected in the shift from conventional chemotherapy to targeted therapies, offering more effective and less toxic treatment options. However, with an average annual cost exceeding $20,000 USD, many LMICs faced severe budget constraints, leading to limited use of trastuzumab and poor survival rates for patients. In response, WHO prequalified the first trastuzumab biosimilar in 2019. These biosimilars, offering the same efficacy and safety at approximately 65% lower cost, had the potential to transform breast cancer treatment in LMICs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since then, several trastuzumab biosimilars have been approved or are in development by various companies. These biosimilars have been launched in all WHO regions. The inclusion of these biosimilars on the EML facilitated initiatives such as the Cancer Access Partnership, led by the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) and the American Cancer Society (ACS), which included biological medicines for the first time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today, equitable global access to trastuzumab biosimilars is gradually being realized. Countries like India and Brazil have swiftly integrated these biosimilars into their national healthcare systems. India, for example, has approved multiple trastuzumab biosimilars, significantly reducing treatment costs and broadening patient access nationwide. Similarly, South Africa has adopted trastuzumab biosimilars into its treatment protocols, enhancing accessibility to essential breast cancer medications for patients. Overall, trastuzumab biosimilars have received market authorization and approval in at least 65 countries, signaling a major step forward in global cancer care (7).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;As of 2019, trastuzumab biosimilars have received market authorization and approval in over 65 countries (8).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2019 inclusion of adalimumab (recommended for rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn's disease) further underscored WHO’s commitment to improving access and affordability through biosimilars. Over the next few years, WHO has built on this biosimilar precedent by continuing to add further important biologic medicines to the EML and explicitly listing their quality-assured biosimilars as alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Removing barriers to adoption&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While biosimilars have made promising inroads into the Model List, concerns have persisted regarding interchangeability and switching between reference biologics and their biosimilar versions. In 2021, after reviewing substantial evidence confirming the safety and efficacy of transitioning patients from original biologics to biosimilars, the WHO recommended that quality-assured biosimilars of listed biologic medicines should also be viewed as interchangeable and considered for national selection and procurement. This recommendation was pivotal for improving real-world access and use, positioning biosimilars as equal to their reference counterparts and affirming confidence in transitioning patients to save costs without compromising care. The committee reinforced this support by recommending the expansion of WHO prequalification to include biosimilars and advocating for their regular evaluation alongside originators (9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends that quality-assured biosimilars of EML-listed biologic medicines should be viewed as interchangeable and eligible for selection and procurement at the country level for national essential medicines lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their potential, challenges remain in integrating biosimilars in clinical practice across countries and clinical areas. Issues such as concerns about switching between biosimilars and reference products, regulatory complexities, and educational gaps among healthcare professionals necessitate careful consideration (10). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Current landscape of essential biologic and biosimilar medicines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2023 Model List includes multiple biologics and their biosimilar alternatives across different therapeutic areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table 1: Biologic medicines and therapeutic alternatives (including quality-assured biosimilars) on the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://list.essentialmeds.org//%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;WHO Model Lists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col&gt;&lt;col&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medicine &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indication(s)&lt;/strong&gt;

Regulatory barriers, lack of awareness among healthcare professionals, and limited manufacturing capabilities in certain regions can hinder the widespread acceptance and utilization of biosimilars. Addressing these challenges requires coordinated efforts among governments, healthcare providers, and the pharmaceutical industry to promote education, streamline regulatory processes, and invest in local manufacturing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO continues to play a pivotal role in promoting the adoption of biosimilars through its strategic initiatives. WHO emphasizes the importance of regulatory harmonization and supports countries in building robust regulatory frameworks to ensure the quality, safety, and efficacy of biosimilars. Additionally, WHO collaborates with various stakeholders to enhance healthcare professional education and public awareness about the benefits of biosimilars, fostering a more receptive environment for their adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;References&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;white-space:inherit;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agency EM.

This condition disproportionately affects young children, women and girls, impacting 3 out of 10 women and 4 out of 10 children globally. It is most prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, where the lack of access to diagnosis and treatment can increase the risk of infections and death, cause extreme fatigue, lead to poor pregnancy outcomes, contribute to lost earnings, and impede growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anaemia is an indicator of overall health, with its causes ranging from nutritional deficiencies and infections to inflammation, gynaecological and obstetric conditions, and inherited red blood cell disorders. It is therefore essential to accurately measure haemoglobin and understand its underlying causes, as emphasized in &lt;a target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789240074033/%22"&gt;Accelerating anaemia reduction: a comprehensive framework for action&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on this framework, WHO has released new guidelines and innovative tools to enhance the measurement, interpretation and reporting of haemoglobin concentrations. This includes the &lt;a target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789240088542/%22"&gt;WHO guideline on haemoglobin cutoffs&lt;/a&gt;, which provides crucial updates on how haemoglobin levels should be measured and adjusted according to factors like elevation of residence and smoking habits. It also sets thresholds for defining anaemia and its severity across different age, sex and physiological groups. Additionally, the guideline highlights the importance of using haemoglobin levels to assess the impact of iron interventions aimed at preventing and treating iron deficiency anaemia, and to determine the public health significance of anaemia prevalence in populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recently developed &lt;a target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" href="https://www.who.int/%22/tools/micronutrient-survey-analyser-and-other-tools/%22"&gt;Micronutrient Survey Analyser&lt;/a&gt; web tool aids the adoption of these updated thresholds. This tool offers standard analyses and templates for reporting haemoglobin concentrations, along with data quality checks to help interpret the results accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Using appropriate methods to measure, analyse and interpret haemoglobin concentrations is crucial to address and treat anaemia, ensuring that no individual is left behind in the pursuit of better health,\" said Dr Luz Maria de Regil, Director of the WHO Department of Nutrition and Food Safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing anaemia prevalence among women aged 15–49 years is one of the World Health Assembly &lt;a target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" href="https://www.who.int/%22/teams/nutrition-and-food-safety/global-targets-2025/%22"&gt;Global Nutrition Targets for 2025&lt;/a&gt;. Despite some progress, we are not currently on-track to achieve this target. This has prompted WHO to propose extending the target to 2030 in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of ending all forms of malnutrition by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With anaemia remaining a significant public health challenge in many countries, WHO's updated guidelines and tools aim to support the accurate assessment of anaemia and its underlying causes, ensuring that appropriate interventions are delivered where and when they are needed most.&lt;/p&gt;We are encouraged that countries, donors and civil society are mobilizing new commitments for nutrition as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://nutritionforgrowth.org/2025-summit//%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Nutrition for Growth (N4G) Summit&lt;/a&gt; taking place in Paris, 27–28 March 2025.

Currently, these medicines are being delivered to Mongolia and Uzbekistan, with next shipments planned for Ecuador, Jordan, Nepal and Zambia. The treatments are expected to reach approximately 5000 children with cancer across at least 30 hospitals in these countries within this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global Platform is a first initiative of its kind. Countries in the pilot phase will receive an uninterrupted supply of quality-assured childhood cancer medicines at no cost. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), childhood cancer survival rates are often below 30%, significantly lower than those in high-income countries. Six additional countries have been formally invited to join the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initiative is poised to become the largest, with the goal of reaching 50 nations in the next 5 to 7 years. It aims to eventually provide medicines for the treatment of approximately 120 000 children with cancer in LMICs, significantly reducing mortality rates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For too long, children with cancer have lacked access to life-saving medicines,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This unique partnership between WHO and St. Jude is working to provide quality-assured cancer medicines to paediatric hospitals in low-and middle-income countries. WHO is proud to be part of this joint initiative with St. Jude, bringing health and hope to children around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, an estimated 400 000 children worldwide develop cancer. The majority of these children, living in resource-limited settings, are unable to consistently obtain or afford cancer medicines. It is estimated that 70% of the children from these settings die from cancer due to factors such as lack of appropriate treatment, treatment disruptions or low-quality medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A child’s chances of surviving cancer are largely determined by where they are born, making this one of the starkest disparities in global healthcare,” said James R. Downing, MD, president and CEO of St. Jude. “St. Jude was founded on Danny Thomas’ dream that no child should die in the dawn of life. By developing this platform, we believe this dream can someday be achieved for children stricken by cancer, irrespective of where they live.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Jude and WHO announced the platform in 2021 to ensure children around the world have access to lifesaving treatments. The platform brings together governments, the pharmaceutical industry and non-governmental organizations in a unique collaborative model focused on creating solutions for children with cancer. The co-design approach addresses the broader needs of national stakeholders, with a focus on capacity building and long-term sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform provides comprehensive end-to-end support, from consolidating global demand to shaping the market, assisting countries with medicine selection and developing treatment standards. It represents a transformative model for the broader global health community working together to tackle health challenges, in particular for children and noncommunicable diseases. To accomplish this, St. Jude and WHO partner with UNICEF Supply Division, and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Strategic Fund.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Notes to editors:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dedicated to the well-being of all people and guided by science, the World Health Organization (WHO) leads and champions global efforts to give everyone, everywhere an equal chance at a safe and healthy life. WHO is the UN agency for health that connects nations, partners and people on the front lines in 150+ locations – leading the world’s response to health emergencies, preventing disease, addressing the root causes of health issues and expanding access to medicines and health care. WHO’s mission is to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On childhood cancer, WHO works with over 100 global partners through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/global-initiative-for-childhood-cancer/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer&lt;/a&gt;, to support governments in developing high-quality cancer centres and regional satellites that ensure early, accurate diagnosis and effective treatments for children with cancer. WHO also develops standards and tools to guide the planning and implementation of interventions for diagnosis, treatment and palliative and survivorship care. Progress on childhood cancer, as well as on other noncommunicable diseases, are part of the agenda for the UN General Assembly Fourth&amp;nbsp;High-Level Meeting of the on noncommunicable diseases to take place in September 2025.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is leading the way the world understands, treats and cures childhood cancer, sickle cell disease and other life-threatening disorders. It is a non-profit organization based in Memphis, Tennessee, USA, and the only National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center devoted solely to children. Treatments developed at St. Jude have helped push the overall childhood cancer survival rate from 20% to 80% since the hospital opened more than 60 years ago. St. Jude shares the breakthroughs it makes to help doctors and researchers at local hospitals and cancer centers around the world improve the quality of treatment and care for even more children. To learn more, visit &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.stjude.org//%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;stjude.org,&lt;/a&gt; read &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://blogs.stjude.org/progress.html/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Progress: A Digital Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and follow St. Jude on social media at &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://twitter.com/stjuderesearch/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;@stjuderesearch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO and St. Jude first collaborated in 2018, when St. Jude became the first WHO Collaborating Centre for Childhood Cancer and committed US$15 million for the creation of the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.stjude.org/global/collaborating-to-cure/global-initiative.html/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer&lt;/a&gt; (Global Initiative). This initiative supports more than 70 governments in building and sustaining local cancer programs and aims to increase survival to 60% by 2030.

Other countries in the WHO African Region will benefit from the technical and logistical support to strengthen their work on skin NTDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It remains to be seen what the effect of recent political developments will be, but it looks like private actors will have to step up their contribution to global health. A sudden stop in mass drug administration or case-management programmes could have catastrophic consequences for NTDs all around the world. We won’t allow the good work of recent years go to waste”, &lt;/em&gt;said Iñigo Lasa, Chief Executive Officer, Anesvad Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO and Anesvad Foundation collaboration started in 2001. Initially focused on Buruli ulcer only, since 2016 the collaboration has extended to cover a larger number of skin NTDs. Today, the Anesvad Foundation is the first organization to support large-scale implementation of the WHO-recommended integrated approach for control and management of skin NTDs. It also supports WHO’s skin NTD global coordination activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;WHO is grateful for its 24 years of partnership with the Anesvad Foundation to address neglected tropical diseases that cause immense suffering to the poor”,&lt;/em&gt; said Dr Ibrahima Socé Fall, Director, WHO Global Neglected Tropical Diseases Programme&lt;em&gt;. “This renewed agreement comes at a critical time as we conduct the road map mid-term review (2021−2025) and develop an accelerated implementation plan (2026−2030).&lt;/em&gt;” &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anesvad Foundation is a Non-State Actor in official relations with WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="\&amp;quot;_com_6\&amp;quot;" language="\&amp;quot;JavaScript\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news/item//10-02-2025-who-and-anesvad-foundation-to-extend-collaboration-on-skin-ntds-in-sub-saharan-africa</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news/item//10-02-2025-who-and-anesvad-foundation-to-extend-collaboration-on-skin-ntds-in-sub-saharan-africa</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 10:38:15 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news/:language?</route_path><route_name>News</route_name></route></item><item><title>WHO updates guidelines on opioid dependence treatment and overdose prevention</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO announces development of updated guidelines for the psychosocially assisted pharmacological treatment of opioid dependence and community management of opioid overdose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, approximately 60 million people globally engaged in non-medical opioid use, including the use of drugs like heroin, morphine, codeine, fentanyl, methadone, tramadol, and other similar substances. Their regular non-medical use, prolonged use, use by injection, misuse and use without medical supervision can lead to opioid dependence and other health problems, and associated with significant health burden. Out of 600,000 deaths attributed to drug use, about 450 000 are due to use of opioids according to the latest WHO estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is crucial that people with opioid dependence and those at risk of opioid overdose have access to prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and care, which are of good quality, affordable, ethical and evidence based. While some 64 million people globally are estimated to live with drug use disorders, access to treatment remains very limited, with less than 10% having access to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address the issue, WHO has published guidelines for the psychosocially assisted pharmacological treatment of opioid dependence (2009) and community management of opioid overdose (2014).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the guidelines, WHO recommends the use of a range of treatment options for opioid dependence. These include opioid agonist maintenance treatment (or OAMT) with medicines such as methadone and buprenorphine, pharmacological treatment with opioid antagonists (such as naltrexone) as well as psychosocial support. In the choice of treatment, WHO recommends OAMT to be used for most patients as the intervention with strongest evidence of effectiveness for variety of outcomes. These include reduction in non-medical opioid use, mortality and morbidity (including due to opioid overdose, HIV and viral hepatitis), lowering risk of crime and incarceration, better retention in treatment, quality of life and overall wellbeing. In the guidelines on community management of opioid overdose, WHO recommends that people who are likely to witness an opioid overdose, including people who use opioids, and their family and friends should be given access to naloxone and training in its use so that they can respond to opioid overdose in an emergency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, WHO is convening a guideline development group (GDG) for update of both guidelines with an aim to improve availability and access to treatment of opioid dependence and reduce the number of deaths from opioid overdose by providing evidence-based recommendations on the psychosocially assisted pharmacological treatment and interventions on prevention and management of opioid overdose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A GDG meeting will be held in Geneva in October 2025. Evidence, including systematic reviews, about treatment of opioid dependence and management of opioid overdose will be presented to the GDG. GDG members will contribute to the review of systematic reviews, evidence summaries, technical updates, and will propose recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guideline development group composition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In accordance with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/145714/%22" target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;WHO guidelines for developing recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, the steering group for the guidelines development includes members from multiple WHO teams in Headquarter and Regional Offices, including departments directly working in the area of drug policy, such as the Departments of Mental Health, Brain Health and Substance Use (UCN/MSD), Access to Medicines and Health Products (MHP/HPS), and Global HIV, Hepatitis and STIs programmes (UCN/HHS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guideline Development Group (GDG) is composed of members from all WHO regions, serving in their individual capacities rather than as representatives of affiliated organizations. GDG members were selected by WHO technical staff based on their technical expertise, their role as end-users (e.g., programme managers and healthcare providers), and their representation of affected communities. Members do not receive financial compensation for their contributions to this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for public comments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure transparency and inclusivity, WHO invites members of the public and interested organizations to review the biographies of the GDG members and provide feedback.

Tobacco and e-cigarettes will also be kicked out of Doha’s eight stadiums, ensuring fans can enjoy smoke-free air while sitting in their seats watching\r\n    world football’s biggest event.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Implementing tobacco and smoke-free measures at the FIFA World Cup™ has been the goal of a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/initiatives/sports-and-health/healthy-2022-world-cup/%22"&gt;unique partnership&lt;/a&gt; between FIFA, the Government of Qatar and the World Health Organization (WHO) to make the tournament healthy and safe. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each of the three partners have long promoted effective tobacco control measures, while also raising awareness around tobacco health hazards,” according to Dr Rayana Bou Haka, WHO Representative to Qatar. “They have also backed the\r\n    implementation of a tobacco-free policy at FIFA sporting events. Still, evidence shows that successful tobacco-free mega sporting events depend on effective communication and enforcement of policies.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://digitalhub.fifa.com/m/6d8f449e26673881/original/FIFA-Event-Policy-on-Tobacco-Clean-23Mar21.pdf/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;FIFA Event Policy for Tobacco&lt;/a&gt; is in line with &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/259086?locale-attribute=fr&amp;amp;\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;WHO recommendations for mega-sporting events&lt;/a&gt; and aims to protect people’s right to breathe clean air, uncontaminated by carcinogens and other harmful substances. The policy prohibits smoking and vaping in the stadium\r\n    bowl and only allows it in outdoor designated smoking areas in the outer perimeter of the stadiums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strengthened regulation to make venues safe for fans is part of a unique collaboration between FIFA, WHO and the Ministry of Public Health, Qatar, designed to harness the power of football to protect and promote health for all. This, in turn, will\r\n    create a blueprint for protecting and promoting health at mass gatherings which can then be shared with other sports organisations.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tobacco remains one of the biggest public health threats the world has ever faced, killing 7 million people a year from direct tobacco use, and a further 1.2 million from the effects of second-hand smoke, according to WHO. The tournament organizers have\r\n    taken measures with the goal of ensuring fans can enjoy the match without exposure to second-hand smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIFA has long been committed to countering the use of tobacco, being considered a pioneer among sports organizations in this respect. As far back as 1986, in the days when tobacco sponsorship was commonplace in sports, FIFA announced it would no longer\r\n    accept advertising from the tobacco industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qatar will be assigning a team of 80 tobacco inspectors to support FIFA volunteers and security staff in enforcing the FIFA Event Policy on Tobacco during the FIFA World Cup, which runs from 21 November to 18 December. Visual and audio communications\r\n    tools have also been designed to reach the sizeable audience and raise awareness by FIFA, Qatar and WHO, including Florence, a virtual health worker created by WHO, able to provide digital counselling services to those trying to quit tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Qatar has been a frontrunner in tobacco control in the region,” said Dr Kholoud&amp;nbsp;Ateeq K M Al-Motawaa, head of noncommunicable disease for Qatar’s Ministry of Public Health. “For the FIFA World Cup, tobacco control measures\r\n    have been developed for inside and outside stadiums, especially in public places, while tobacco-free environments in fan zones will be rigorously enforced where supporters without tickets can watch games on large screens surrounded by smoke-free air.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIFA recognises that exposure to second-hand smoke and vapours is harmful. “The FIFA World Cup in Qatar will have a global audience of five billion people, which gives football a significant platform for social change,” said FIFA Head of Sustainability\r\n    Federico Addiechi. “For two decades, global tournaments have been played in tobacco-free environments, but it is a necessary step to strengthen the implementation of that policy in Doha in November and December and we are committed to do so.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tobacco has also long represented a serious challenge to ongoing efforts to prevent noncommunicable diseases in many countries. Noncommunicable diseases, mainly cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes are a leading\r\n    cause of premature death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prohibiting the use, sale and promotion of tobacco products at sporting events remains a key step in the battle against tobacco and illness associated with tobacco,” said&amp;nbsp;Vinayak&amp;nbsp;Prasad, WHO technical advisor on tobacco control.\r\n    “The FIFA World Cup being held in Qatar in 2022 offers a powerful opportunity to take global tobacco control efforts to a new level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//strengthened-regulation-of-tobacco-free-venues-at-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//strengthened-regulation-of-tobacco-free-venues-at-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022</guid><pubDate>Sun, 13 Nov 2022 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news-room/:category?/:language?</route_path><route_name>Newsroom</route_name></route></item><item><title>The Novavax vaccine against COVID-19: What you need to know</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 28 September 2022 to ensure consistency of formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Technical Advisory Group for Emergency Use Listing listed Nuvaxovid (NVX-CoV2373) vaccine against COVID-19 and Covovax (NVX-CoV2373) vaccine against COVID-19 for emergency use on 20 December 2021 and 17 December 2021 respectively. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Novavax vaccine will be manufactured in two different facilities. In Europe, the vaccine will be manufactured under the trade name Nuvaxovid and has been approved by the European Medicines Agency, and in India, the vaccine will be manufactured by\r\n    Serum Institute of India under the trade name Covovax and has been approved by the Drugs Controller General of India. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has issued&amp;nbsp;interim policy recommendations&amp;nbsp;for the use of the Novavax (NVX-CoV2373) vaccine.&amp;nbsp;This article provides a summary of those interim recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this article, the vaccine will be referred to as Novavax (NVX-CoV2373).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The background documents are also available&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/363204/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-Novavax_NVX-CoV2373-2022.1-eng.pdf/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" data-sf-marked="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who can take this vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is safe and effective for all individuals aged 12 and above. In line with the WHO Prioritization Roadmap and the WHO Values Framework, older adults, health workers and immunocompromised persons should be prioritised.&amp;nbsp;Adolescents with moderate to severe immunocompromising conditions belong to the highest priority-use group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Novavax vaccine can be offered to people who have had COVID-19 in the past. But individuals may choose to delay vaccination for 3 months following the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Should pregnant and breastfeeding women be vaccinated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;Emerging post-introduction pharmacovigilance data relating to the use of NVX-CoV2373 in pregnant women have not identified any pregnancy-related safety concerns and based on previous evidence from other protein-based vaccines during pregnancy, efficacy is expected to be comparable to\r\n    non-pregnant women of a similar age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO has identified pregnant persons as a high priority-use group for COVID-19 vaccination, given their increased risk of severe outcomes. WHO recommends the use of the Novavax (NVX-CoV2373) vaccine in pregnant persons when the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant persons outweigh the potential risks. To help pregnant women make this assessment, they should be provided with information about the risks\r\n    of COVID-19 in pregnancy, the likely benefits of vaccination in the local epidemiological context, and the current limitations of safety data in pregnant persons. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend\r\n    delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends the same use of Novavax (NVX-CoV2373) vaccine in breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding persons.Vaccine effectiveness is expected to be similar in breastfeeding persons as in other adults. As Novavax\r\n    (NVX-CoV2373) vaccine is not a live virus vaccine, it is biologically and clinically unlikely to pose a risk to the breastfeeding child. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who is the vaccine not recommended for?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is not recommended for people younger than 12 years of age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine should not take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persons with acute PCR-confirmed COVID-19 should not be vaccinated until after they have recovered from acute illness and the criteria for ending isolation have been met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a body temperature over 38.5°C should postpone vaccination until they no longer have a fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE has thoroughly assessed the data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine and has recommended its use for people aged 12 and above. The WHO EUL process also evaluates the quality of manufacturing along with safety and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very rare serious adverse events of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed though cases typically occurred within a few days after vaccination, and were generally mild.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How efficacious is the vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of Novavax (NVX-CoV2373) has been assessed in three Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials. Of the two Phase 3 trials, both found that the efficacy of the vaccine against mild, moderate, and severe disease is 90%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of Novavax(NVX-CoV2373) in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age was evaluated in an interim analysis of the paediatric expansion portion of the ongoing phase 3 study in United States. The vaccine effectiveness reached 80% for this population.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is the recommended dosage?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends the use of the Novavax (NVX-CoV2373) vaccine as 2 doses (0.5 ml) given intramuscularly. An 8-week interval is recommended between primary series doses of NVX-CoV2373.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A first booster dose is recommended 4-6 months after the completion of the primary series. In accordance with the WHO Prioritization Roadmap, the highest priority-use groups (e.g. older adults, persons with moderate to severe immunocompromising conditions, and health workers) should be offered it first.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further reduce the risk of severe disease, deaths and disruptions of health services, WHO recommends countries should consider a second booster dose 4-6 months after the first booster dose for all older persons, all persons with moderate and severe immunocompromising conditions, regardless of age, adults with comorbidities, pregnant persons and health workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For adolescents 12-18 years of age, there is currently insufficient evidence for recommending a booster dose, except for those with immunocompromising conditions.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can this vaccine be ‘mixed and matched’ with other vaccines?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE accepts two heterologous doses of WHO EUL COVID-19 vaccines as a complete primary series. However, there is limited evidence available on the use of Novavax (NVX-CoV2373) in a heterologous schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it prevent infection and transmission?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As there is not currently sufficient evidence to date to evaluate the impact of the vaccine on transmission, public health and social measures must continue, including use of face masks, physical distancing, handwashing, appropriate ventilation, and other measures as appropriate in particular settings, depending on the COVID-19 epidemiology and potential risks of emerging variants. Government advice on public health and social measures should continue to be followed by both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. SAGE will update this advice as information on the impact of vaccination on virus transmission and indirect protection is assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it work against new variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Phase 3 study conducted in the USA and Mexico during a period in which multiple variants (Alpha, Beta and Delta) were in circulation, vaccine efficacy against mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 was 90%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In view of these findings, WHO recommends the use of Novavax (NVX-CoV2373) vaccine according to the WHO Prioritization Roadmap, even if currently recognized Variants of Concern (VOC) are present in the country. If new VOCs emerge for which vaccine performance\r\n    is compromised, these recommendations will be updated accordingly. There are insufficient data still for Omicron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How does this vaccine compare to other COVID-19 vaccines already in use?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to compare vaccine head-to-head due to the different approaches taken in designing the respective studies, but overall, all of the vaccines that have achieved WHO Emergency Use Listing are highly effective in preventing severe disease\r\n    and hospitalization due to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 28 September 2022 to reflect&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/363204/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-Novavax_NVX-CoV2373-2022.1-eng.pdf/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;updated interim recommendations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be no further updates to this page.

I was extremely independent, and – as a woman – felt very strongly about being a role model for my boys. I think that\r\n    is what you have to learn to hang onto, that on the inside, you haven't changed.”, she recounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helena is one of six people in a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms6BrG-RJJI\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;short film documentary&lt;/a&gt; that sheds light on the experiences of people living with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and mental health conditions\r\n    around the world. People with lived experience often can offer valuable expertise and powerful narratives on how to manage and improve their individual health as well as the health of fellow community members. Their first-hand insights can help shape\r\n    policies, create better health programmes, and inspire others to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO is dedicated to advancing the meaningful engagement of people living with NCDs and mental health conditions worldwide, and has recently established a range of activities and platforms to support this goal. The latest is a new film\r\n    series on the topic in all six UN languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the entire 30-minute documentary, “Nothing for Us, Without Us: listening and learning from people with lived experience”, on WHO’s YouTube channel:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="\&amp;quot;button" button-dark-border\"=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhdZ_kwVWoI\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class="\&amp;quot;button" button-dark-border\"=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QcsDqxf00M\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class="\&amp;quot;button" button-dark-border\"=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms6BrG-RJJI\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class="\&amp;quot;button" button-dark-border\"=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RH4tkOAAu4\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class="\&amp;quot;button" button-dark-border\"=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX9rP-kblf8\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class="\&amp;quot;button" button-dark-border\"=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn_VQn4p47g\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/noncommunicable-diseases/web-teamartboard-4.png?sfvrsn=2b3735cb_3\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;1150541\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Type 2 diabetes in a changing environment: Ali’s lived experience in Lebanon&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the municipality of Ghobeiry in Lebanon, Ali motivates others in his community to exercise, eat better food and lead a healthier life, after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People may not be taking care of themselves, not because they can't buy medicine, or are without access to healthy food.

In light of the global epidemic of NCDs, the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and persisting health inequities,\r\n    understanding the complex determinants of health conditions and upholding principles of respect, value and dignity are equally crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch Hauwa’s story:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="\&amp;quot;button" button-dark-border\"=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju-7DHhFMxk\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class="\&amp;quot;button" button-dark-border\"=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiQOzW2OtUU\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class="\&amp;quot;button" button-dark-border\"=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9L2kzbvgQk\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class="\&amp;quot;button" button-dark-border\"=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWpe-XE2M8U\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class="\&amp;quot;button" button-dark-border\"=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN7A_iZRcrg\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\r\n&lt;div class="\&amp;quot;button" button-dark-border\"=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_M5OvztpcA\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/noncommunicable-diseases/web-teamartboard-9.png?sfvrsn=13ea94f1_7\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;928436\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Type 1 Diabetes and the next generation of leaders: Mark’s lived experience in Brazil&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I received the diagnosis, it was […] difficult to deal with a situation that was now mine.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Regional consultations, case studies, and a new framework for meaningful engagement &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2022, WHO’s Global Coordination Mechanism on NCDs&amp;nbsp;(GCM/NCD) within the Global NCD Platform co-convened several regional consultations and focus groups in all WHO-regions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is now clearer than ever that people with lived experience of NCDs around the world face many challenges to meaningful engagement,” says Dr Svetlana Akselrod, Director of the WHO Global NCD Platform. “What has been missing\r\n            is a clear roadmap for actions, along with connections with all levels of WHO and with WHO Member States. The roadmap and connections have now been established, and this is a significant achievement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insights from all the consultations and the film are feeding into the co-development of the WHO Framework for meaningful engagement of people living with NCDs and mental health conditions, which is scheduled to be released in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaningful engagement of people living with NCDs and mental health conditions emphasizes the diversity and intersectionality of individuals and communities. Aspects of social and political identities, such as gender, ethnicity, religion and socioeconomic\r\n            status to name but a few, overlap and create multiple forms of power and privilege. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By understanding and integrating these multiple layers and perspectives, policy makers, health professionals, health providers and people with lived experiences can move from traditional top-down or one-size-fits-all models of care to co-designing\r\n            health programmes, policies and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//nothing-for-us--without-us--new-film-series-on-people-living-with-noncommunicable-diseases-and-mental-health-condition</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//nothing-for-us--without-us--new-film-series-on-people-living-with-noncommunicable-diseases-and-mental-health-condition</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news-room/:category?/:language?</route_path><route_name>Newsroom</route_name></route></item><item><title>The Valneva VLA2001 COVID-19 vaccine: What you need to know</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was published on 18 August 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Valneva vaccine is a purified, inactivated, and adjuvanted whole virus SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has issued&amp;nbsp;interim policy recommendations&amp;nbsp;for the use of the Valneva (VLA2001) vaccine.&amp;nbsp;This article provides a summary of those interim recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this article, the vaccine will be referred to as Valneva or the Valneva vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The background documents are also available&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Valneva-VLA2001-background/%22"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;font-size:18px;font-weight:700;text-align:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Who can take the vaccine?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is safe and effective for all individuals aged 18 to 50 years. In line with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Prioritization-2023.1/%22"&gt;WHO Prioritization Roadmap&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/who-sage-values-framework-for-the-allocation-and-prioritization-of-covid-19-vaccination/%22"&gt;WHO Values Framework&lt;/a&gt;, older adults, health workers and immunocompromised persons should be prioritized.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Should pregnant and breastfeeding women be vaccinated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the adverse consequences of COVID-19 disease during pregnancy and the favorable safety profile of Valneva, WHO recommends the use of Valneva in pregnant individuals. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine effectiveness is expected to be similar in breastfeeding women as in other adults. WHO recommends the use of the vaccine in breastfeeding women as in other adults. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who is the vaccine not recommended for?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to limited data on the immunogenicity of this vaccine in persons aged 50 years and above, the Valneva vaccine is not recommended for this age group. Similarly, there is no data on efficacy or safety for persons below the age of 18 years for this vaccine. Vaccination of individuals below 18 years of age with this vaccine is therefore currently not recommended.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have an anaphylactic reaction following the first dose of the VLA2001 vaccine should not receive any further doses of the same vaccine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with an acute febrile illness (i.e. with a body temperature &amp;gt;38.5 ºC) should postpone vaccination until they are afebrile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE has thoroughly assessed the data on quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine and has recommended its use for people aged 18 to 50. Safety data is limited for persons over 50 years of age.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How efficacious is the vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no longer considered ethical to ask a group of people to remain unvaccinated for participation in efficacy trials. To counter this, WHO, national and international regulators, as well as manufacturers have agreed to evaluate new vaccines on the basis of immunogenicity data.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the pivotal clinical immunogenicity study, people 30 years and older who received Valneva produced more neutralizing antibodies and had about the same seroconversion as people who received the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know/%22"&gt;Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] vaccine)&lt;/a&gt;, following two doses of the vaccine. People 18 to 29 years who received Valneva produced even more neutralizing antibodies, following two doses of the vaccine. There were only 3 people over the age of 50 and therefore data are limited for people above 50 years. These results indicate that it likely provides sufficient protection against COVID-19 for people 18 to 50 years of age.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is the recommended dosage?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommended primary vaccine series is 2 doses (0.5 ml each dose) given intramuscularly. The second dose is recommended to be administered at least 28 days after the first dose.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is a booster dose recommended for this vaccine?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In accordance with the WHO Prioritization Roadmap, a booster dose is recommended for the highest and high priority-use groups (i.e. older adults, health workers, persons with comorbidities), administered 4–6 months after completion of the primary series. If more than 6 months have elapsed since completion of the primary series, the booster dose should be given at the earliest opportunity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can this vaccine be ‘mixed and matched’ with other vaccines?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Valneva vaccine cannot be used as a heterologous booster post primary vaccination with a mRNA vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Valneva vaccine can be considered as a heterologous booster post primary vaccination with ChAdOx1-S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no data for the use of the Valneva vaccine as a heterologous booster after primary vaccination series with inactivated and protein-based vaccines; until such data become available its use as a heterologous booster post primary vaccination with inactivated or protein-based vaccines are currently not recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;font-size:18px;font-weight:700;text-align:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Does it prevent infection and transmission?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no data available related to the impact of the Valneva vaccine on the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we must maintain and strengthen public health measures that work: masking, physical distancing, handwashing, respiratory and cough hygiene, avoiding crowds, and ensuring good ventilation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it work against new variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies are ongoing to evaluate the ability of Valneva to neutralize variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Initial results are available and indicate that the Valneva vaccine produces fewer neutralizing antibodies against the Delta and Omicron variants, indicating it provides less protection against these variants.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How does this vaccine compare to other COVID-19 vaccines already in use?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to compare vaccines head-to-head due to the different approaches taken in designing the respective studies, but overall, all of the vaccines that have been recommended by SAGE are highly effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalization due to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be no further updates to this page.

In line with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Prioritization-2023.1/%22"&gt;WHO Prioritization Roadmap&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/who-sage-values-framework-for-the-allocation-and-prioritization-of-covid-19-vaccination/%22"&gt;WHO Values Framework&lt;/a&gt;, older adults, immunocompromised persons and health workers are the highest priority-use groups. All efforts should be taken to achieve high vaccine coverage rates in the highest and high priority-use groups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Should pregnant and breastfeeding women be vaccinated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the adverse consequences of COVID-19 disease during pregnancy and the increasing data supporting a favorable safety profile of BNT162b2 in pregnancy, WHO recommends the use of BNT162b2 in pregnant individuals. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing\r\n    prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine effectiveness is expected to be similar in breastfeeding women as in other adults. WHO recommends the use of the vaccine in breastfeeding women as in other adults. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding because of vaccination.&amp;nbsp;Vaccine-elicited antibodies have been found in breast milk following vaccination of breastfeeding women, suggesting possible neonatal as well as maternal protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who should not take the vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with a history of severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine should not take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with fever (body temperature over 38.5 ºC) should postpone vaccination until they are afebrile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is this vaccine recommended for children and adolescents?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vaccine is authorized for use for those aged 6 months and older, with an adjustment in the recommended dosage for those aged 6 months to 4 years, and an adjustment for those aged 5-11 years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends that countries should consider using the vaccine in children aged 6 months and older to 17 only when high vaccine coverage with 2 doses has been achieved in the highest and high priority-use groups as identified in the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children and adolescents aged 6 months - 17 years of age with comorbidities that put them at significantly higher risk of serious COVID-19 disease, should be offered vaccination, alongside other high-risk groups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In accordance with the WHO Prioritization Roadmap, the priority remains to prevent deaths by achieving high vaccine coverage (primary series and boosters) in the highest and high priority-use groups. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, children are at lower risk of COVID-19. That is why WHO recommend that countries prioritize vaccinating people who have higher risk first, like people who are older, have existing health conditions and health workers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt;The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS), a group of experts that provides independent and authoritative guidance to WHO on the topic of safe vaccine use, receives and assesses reports of suspected safety events of potentially international\r\n        impact. In October 2021, the GACVS COVID-19 subcommittee concluded that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have clear benefits in all age groups in reducing hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very rare serious adverse event is myocarditis, which is mainly observed in young males aged 18-35 after the second dose. &amp;nbsp;These myocarditis cases typically occurred within a few days after vaccination, are generally mild, respond to conservative treatment, and are less severe with better outcomes than classical myocarditis or COVID-19 related myocarditis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How efficacious is the vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer BioNTech vaccine against COVID-19 has very high efficacy against severe disease and moderate efficacy against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is the recommended dosage?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all persons aged 12 years and above, SAGE recommends two doses (30 µg, 0.3 ml each), 4-8 weeks apart given intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For children aged 5 to 11 years SAGE recommends two doses (10 µg, 0.2 ml each) given intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle and provided 4-8 weeks apart, preferentially 8 weeks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For infants and children aged 6 months to 4 years, the recommended schedule is three doses (3µg, 0.2 ml each): a schedule of two&amp;nbsp;doses 3 weeks apart followed by a third dose at least 8 weeks after the second dose&amp;nbsp;are recommended according to the label. However, countries could consider extending the interval between the first and second dose up to 8 weeks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compliance with the full schedule is recommended and the same product can be used for both doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends that severe and moderately immunocompromised persons, including children, should be offered an additional dose of vaccine, as part of the primary series. This is due to the fact that this group is less likely to respond adequately to vaccination following a standard primary vaccination series and are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is a booster dose recommended for this vaccine?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first booster dose is recommended for the highest priority-use groups (e.g. older adults, persons with moderate to severe immunocompromising conditions, and health workers) followed by lower priority-use groups, 4-6 months after the completion of the primary series. If more than 6 months have elapsed since completion of the primary series, the booster dose should be given at the earliest opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends countries should consider a second booster dose 4-6 months after the first booster dose for the highest priority-use groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no recommendation for either first or second booster doses in children under the age of 12, except for children with immunocompromising conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can this vaccine be ‘mixed and matched’ with other vaccines?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE accepts two doses from different COVID-19 vaccine platforms of WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) COVID-19 vaccines as a complete primary series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For countries considering mix-and match schedules, WHO has made recommendations to ensure equivalent or favourable immunogenicity or vaccine effectiveness for heterologous versus homologous schedules:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style="\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Either of the WHO EUL COVID-19 vectored vaccines (Janssen or AstraZeneca Vaxzervia/COVISHIELD) can be used as a second dose following a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;first dose&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the Pfizer vaccine, dependent on product availability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Pfizer vaccine can also be used as a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;second dose&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;following any of the WHO EUL COVID-19 inactivated vaccines (Sinopharm, Sinovac or Bharat) or any of the vectored vaccines (Janssen or AstraZeneca Vaxzervia/COVISHIELD).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Pfizer vaccines can also be used as a booster dose following any of the COVID-19 vaccines with WHO EUL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Does it prevent infection and transmission?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is modest vaccine impact on transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we must maintain and strengthen public health measures that work: masking, physical distancing, handwashing, respiratory and cough hygiene, avoiding crowds, and ensuring good ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it work against new variants?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine remains effective against virus variants, though for the Omicron variant, vaccine effectiveness against severe and mild disease after two doses is lower compared to Delta, and waning is more rapid. Therefore, a third dose (first booster) is recommended for all adults, and a second booster for the highest priority-use groups. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How does this vaccine compare to other COVID-19 vaccines in use?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to compare vaccines head-to-head due to the different approaches taken in designing the respective studies, but overall, all of the vaccines that have achieved WHO Emergency Use Listing are highly effective in preventing severe disease\r\n    and hospitalization due to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 18 August 2022 to reflect the latest guidance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 19 January 2022 to include the latest guidance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 5 January 2022 to update the latest guidance and ensure consistency of information and formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was&amp;nbsp;updated&amp;nbsp;on 20 April 2021 to ensure consistency of information and formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was corrected on 12 January 2021 to remove an erroneous reference relating to pregnancy.

The benefits of booster vaccination are recognized following increasing evidence of waning vaccine effectiveness against mild and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no recommendation for either first or second booster doses in children under the age of 12, except for children with immunocompromising conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can this vaccine be ‘mixed and matched’ with other vaccines?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE accepts two heterologous doses of WHO EUL COVID-19 vaccines as a complete primary series. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For countries considering heterologous schedules, (e.g. using different COVID-19 vaccine platforms), WHO has made the following recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Either of the WHO EUL COVID-19 vectored vaccine (Janssen or AstraZeneca Vaxzervia/COVISHIELD) can be used as a second dose following a &lt;strong&gt;first dose&lt;/strong&gt; of the Moderna vaccine, dependant on product availability. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Moderna vaccine can also be used as a &lt;strong&gt;second dose&lt;/strong&gt; following any of the WHO EUL COVID-19 inactivated vaccines (Sinopharm, Sinovac or Bharat) or any of the vectored vaccines (Janssen or AstraZeneca Vaxzervia/COVISHIELD)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Moderna vaccine can also be used as a booster dose following any of the COVID-19 vaccines with WHO EUL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it prevent infection and transmission?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is only modest impact on preventing mild infections and transmission, particularly in the context of Omicron.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immunity persists for several months, but the full duration is not yet known.&amp;nbsp;A booster dose restores vaccine effectiveness against Omicron, in particular against severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we must maintain public health measures that work: masking, physical distancing, handwashing, respiratory and cough hygiene, avoiding crowds, and ensuring good ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it work against new variants?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine remains effective against virus variants, though for the Omicron variant, vaccine effectiveness against severe and mild disease after two doses is lower compared to Delta, and waning is more rapid. Therefore, a third dose (first booster) is recommended for all adults, and a second booster for the highest priority-use groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How does this vaccine compare to other COVID-19 vaccines already in use?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to compare vaccines head-to-head due to the different approaches taken in designing the respective studies, but overall, all of the vaccines that have achieved WHO Emergency Use Listing are highly effective in preventing severe disease\r\n    and hospitalization due to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 18 August 2022 to reflect the latest guidance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 10 June 2022 to ensure consistency of formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 23 February 2022 to update the latest guidance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 5 January 2022 to update the latest guidance and ensure consistency of information and formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was revised on 29 January 2021 to include a section dedicated to pregnant women, but the recommendations remain the same.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be no further updates to this page.

In line with the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/who-sage-roadmap-for-prioritizing-uses-of-covid-19-vaccines-in-the-context-of-limited-supply/%22"&gt;WHO Prioritization Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and and the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/who-sage-values-framework-for-the-allocation-and-prioritization-of-covid-19-vaccination/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;WHO Values Framework&lt;/a&gt; older adults,\r\n    health workers and immunocompromised persons should be prioritised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Astra-Zeneca vaccine can be offered to people who have had COVID-19 in the past. But individuals may choose to delay vaccination for 3 months following the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Should pregnant and breastfeeding women be vaccinated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends the use of the ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant women only when the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant woman outweigh the potential risks. To help pregnant women make this assessment, they should be provided with\r\n    information about the risks of COVID-19 in pregnancy, the likely benefits of vaccination in the local epidemiological context, and the current limitations of safety data in pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AstraZeneca vaccine is not a live virus vaccine, it is therefore biologically and clinically unlikely to pose a risk to the breastfeeding child. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who is the vaccine not recommended for?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with a history of severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine should not take it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is not recommended for persons younger than 18 years of age pending the results of further studies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, a group of experts that provides independent and authoritative guidance to the WHO on the topic of safe vaccine use, receives and assesses reports of suspected safety events of potentially international\r\n    impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very rare adverse event called Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS), involving unusual and severe blood clotting events associated with low platelet counts, has been reported after vaccination with this vaccine. In countries with ongoing\r\n    SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the benefit of vaccination in protecting against COVID-19 far outweighs the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) has been reported very rarely following vaccination. However, a causal relationship with the vaccine has neither been confirmed nor ruled out and more rigorous studies are needed to fully assess the significance of\r\n    these events. WHO will continue to review these rare reports of GBS and to work closely with national regulators to manage potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective at protecting people from the extremely serious risks of COVID-19, including death, hospitalization and severe disease. Read the 16 April 2021 statement of the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety\r\n    on AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine for reports of very rare side effects. The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences classifies rates of adverse events or medicines and vaccines as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very common &amp;gt; 1/10 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Common (frequent) &amp;gt; 1/100 and &amp;lt; 1/10 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uncommon (infrequent) &amp;gt;1/1000 and &amp;lt; 1/100 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rare&amp;gt; 1/10000 and &amp;lt;1/1000 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very rare &amp;lt; 1/10000 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How efficacious is the vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AstraZeneca vaccine has an efficacy of 72% against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, as shown by the primary analysis of data irrespective of interdose interval from trial participants who received 2 standard doses with an interval varying from about\r\n    4 to 12 weeks. Vaccine efficacy tended to be higher when the interval between doses was longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is the recommended dosage?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommended dosage is two doses given intramuscularly (0.5ml each) with an interval of 8 to 12 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For countries that have not yet achieved high vaccine coverage rates in the high-priority groups and that are experiencing high incidence of COVID-19 cases combined with vaccine supply constraints, longer intervals i.e. up to 16 weeks can be considered.\r\n    WHO recommends focusing on achieving high first dose coverage by extending the inter-dose interval, whilst continuing to maximize second dose coverage of vulnerable groups in the context of variants of concern. It should be noted that the full two\r\n    dose regimen of this vaccine is believed to be more protective against variants of concern than a single dose alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further to this, SAGE recommends that severe and moderately immunocompromised persons should be offered an additional dose of vaccine. This is due to the fact that this group is less likely to respond adequately to vaccination following a standard primary\r\n    vaccination series and are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is a booster dose recommended for this vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A booster dose may be considered 4 – 6 months after completion of the primary vaccination series, starting with the higher priority-use groups, in accordance with the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of booster vaccination are recognized following increasing evidence of waning vaccine effectiveness against mild and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need for, and timing of, booster doses for children aged 5-11 years has not yet been determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can this vaccine be ‘mixed and matched’ with other vaccines?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE accepts two heterologous doses of WHO EUL COVID-19 vaccines as a complete primary series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For countries considering heterologous schedules, WHO has made recommendations to ensure equivalent or favourable immunogenicity or vaccine effectiveness for heterologous versus homologous schedules:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Astra-Zeneca vaccine recommendations have also been modified to indicate that either of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) can be used as a second dose following a &lt;strong&gt;first dose &lt;/strong&gt;with the AstraZeneca vaccine dependant\r\n        on product availability. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Astra-Zeneca vaccine can be used as a &lt;strong&gt;second dose &lt;/strong&gt;following any WHO EUL COVID-19 inactivated vaccines (Sinopharm, Sinovac or Bharat) dependant on product availability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When considering booster vaccination after having been vaccinated with ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] COVID-19 [Astra Zeneca] vaccine for the primary series, SAGE considers using a different type of COVID-19 vaccine for a third dose a more favourable option.\r\n    However, maintaining a homologous schedule is still acceptable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Astra Zeneca vaccine remains a suitable option as a heterologous booster to primary series vaccination with a different vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it prevent infection and transmission?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;No substantive data are available related to impact of the vaccine on transmission or viral shedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we must maintain and strengthen public health and social measures that work: masking, physical distancing, handwashing, respiratory and cough hygiene, avoiding crowds, and ensuring good ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it work against new variants?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE has reviewed all available data on the performance of the vaccine in the settings of variants of concern. SAGE currently recommends its use according to the WHO Prioritization Roadmap, even if virus variants are present in a country. Countries should\r\n    assess the risks and benefits taking into consideration their epidemiological situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary findings highlight the urgent need for a coordinated approach for surveillance and evaluation of variants and their potential impact on vaccine effectiveness. As new data become available, WHO will update recommendations accordingly. There\r\n    are no data yet for Omicron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;____________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 13 June 2022 to ensure consistency of formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 16 March 2022 to reflect the latest guidance and ensure consistency of information and formatting. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 5 January 2022 to update the latest guidance and ensure consistency of information and formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be no further updates to this page.

In line with the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Prioritization-2023.1/%22"&gt;WHO Prioritization Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; and the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/who-sage-values-framework-for-the-allocation-and-prioritization-of-covid-19-vaccination/%22"&gt;WHO Values Framework&lt;/a&gt;, older adults, health workers and immunocompromised persons should be prioritised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sinopharm vaccine can be offered to people who have had COVID-19 in the past. But individuals may choose to delay vaccination for 3 months following the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Should pregnant and breastfeeding&amp;nbsp;women be vaccinated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The available data on the COVID-19 vaccine Sinopharm in pregnant women are insufficient to assess either vaccine efficacy or vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. However, this vaccine is an inactivated vaccine with an adjuvant that is routinely used in many other vaccines with a documented good safety profile, including in pregnant women. The effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine Sinopharm in pregnant women is therefore expected to be comparable to that observed in non-pregnant women of similar age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the interim, WHO recommends the use of the COVID-19 vaccine Sinopharm in pregnant women when the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant woman outweigh the potential risks. To help pregnant women make this assessment, they should be provided with information about the risks of COVID-19 in pregnancy; the likely benefits of vaccination in the local epidemiological context; and the current limitations of safety data in pregnant women. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or considering terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine effectiveness is expected to be similar in breastfeeding women as in other adults. WHO recommends the use of the COVID-19 vaccine Sinopharm in breastfeeding women as in other adults. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who is the vaccine not recommended for?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine should not take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a body temperature over 38.5ºC should postpone vaccination until they no longer have a fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it safe?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE has thoroughly assessed the data on quality, safety and\r\nefficacy of the vaccine and has recommended its use for people aged 18 and\r\nabove.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety data are limited for persons above 60 years of age (due\r\nto the small number of participants in clinical trials). While no differences\r\nin safety profile of the vaccine in older adults compared to younger age groups\r\ncan be anticipated, countries considering using this vaccine in persons older\r\nthan 60 years should maintain active safety monitoring.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How efficacious is the vaccine?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large multi-country Phase 3 trial has shown that 2 doses,\r\nadministered at an interval of 21 days, have an efficacy of 79% against\r\nsymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection 14 or more days after the second dose. Vaccine\r\nefficacy against hospitalization was 79%.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial was not designed and powered to demonstrate efficacy\r\nagainst severe disease in persons with comorbidities, in pregnancy, or in\r\npersons aged 60 years and above. Women were underrepresented in the trial. The\r\nmedian duration of follow-up available at the time of evidence review was 112\r\ndays.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two other efficacy trials are under way but data are not yet\r\navailable.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What’s the recommended dosage?&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends the use of Sinopharm vaccine as 2 doses (0.5 ml) given intramuscularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends that a third, additional dose of the Sinopharm vaccine be offered to persons aged 60 and above as part of an extension of the primary series. Current data does not indicate the need for an additional dose in persons under 60 years of age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends that severe and moderately immunocompromised persons should be offered an additional dose of vaccine. This is due to the fact that this group is less likely to respond adequately to vaccination following a standard primary vaccination series and are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends an interval of 3–4 weeks between the first and second dose of primary series. If the second dose is administered less than 3 weeks after the first, the dose does not need to be repeated. If administration of the second dose is delayed beyond 4 weeks, it should be given at the earliest possible opportunity. When administering an additional dose to over 60s, SAGE recommends countries should initially aim at maximizing 2-dose coverage in that population, and thereafter administer the third dose, starting with the oldest age groups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;Is a booster dose recommended for this vaccine?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;A booster dose may be considered 4 – 6 months after completion of the primary vaccination series, starting with the higher priority-use groups, in accordance with the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of booster vaccination are recognized following\r\nincreasing evidence of waning vaccine effectiveness against mild and\r\nasymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;Either homologous (a different vaccine product to Sinopharm) or heterologous (a booster dose of Sinopharm) doses can be used. A study in Bahrain found that heterologous boosting resulted in a superior immune response compared to homologous boosting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can this vaccine be ‘mixed and matched’ with other vaccines?&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE accepts two heterologous doses of WHO EUL COVID-19 vaccines as a complete primary series. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure equivalent or favourable immunogenicity or vaccine effectiveness either of the WHO EUL COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) or the WHO EUL COVID-19 vectored vaccines (AstraZeneca Vaxzevria/COVISHIELD or Janssen) can be used as a second dose following a first dose with the Sinopharm vaccine dependent on product availability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it prevent infection and transmission?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no substantive data available related to the\r\nimpact of Sinopharm on transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes\r\nCOVID-19 disease.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, WHO reminds of the need to maintain and\r\nstrengthen public health measures that work: masking, physical distancing,\r\nhandwashing, respiratory and cough hygiene, avoiding crowds and ensuring\r\nadequate ventilation.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it work against&amp;nbsp;new variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE currently recommends using this vaccine, according to the\r\nWHO Prioritization Roadmap.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As new data becomes available, WHO will update recommendations\r\naccordingly. This vaccine has not yet been evaluated in the context of\r\ncirculation of widespread variants of concern.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How does this vaccine compare to other vaccines already in use?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We cannot compare the vaccines head-to-head due to the different approaches taken in designing the respective studies, but overall, all of the vaccines that have achieved WHO Emergency Use Listing are highly effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalization due to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 10 June 2022 to update the latest guidance and ensure consistency of information and formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be no further updates to this page.

In line with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Prioritization-2022.1/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;WHO Prioritization Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/who-sage-values-framework-for-the-allocation-and-prioritization-of-covid-19-vaccination/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;WHO Values Framework&lt;/a&gt;, older adults, health workers and immunocompromised persons should be prioritised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sinovac vaccine can be offered to people who have had COVID-19 in the past. But individuals may choose to delay vaccination for 3 months following the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Should pregnant and breastfeeding women be vaccinated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The available data on the Sinovac-CoronaVac (COVID-19) vaccine in pregnant women are insufficient to assess either vaccine efficacy or possible vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. However, this vaccine is an inactivated vaccine with an adjuvant that is commonly used in many other vaccines with a well-documented safety profile, such as Hepatitis B and Tetanus vaccines, including in pregnant women. The effectiveness of the Sinovac-CoronaVac (COVID-19) vaccine in pregnant women is therefore expected to be comparable to that observed in non-pregnant women of similar age. Further studies are expected to evaluate safety and immunogenicity in pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the interim, WHO recommends the use of the Sinovac-CoronaVac (COVID-19) vaccine in pregnant women when the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant woman outweigh the potential risks. To help pregnant women make this assessment, they should be provided with information about the risks of COVID-19 in pregnancy; the likely benefits of vaccination in the local epidemiological context; and the current limitations of safety data in pregnant women. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or considering terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine effectiveness is expected to be similar in lactating women as in other adults. WHO recommends the use of the COVID-19 vaccine Sinovac-CoronaVac in lactating women as in other adults. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who is the vaccine not recommended for?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is not recommended for persons younger than 18 years of age, pending the results of further studied in that age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine should not take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persons with acute PCR-confirmed COVID-19 should not be vaccinated until after they have recovered from acute illness and the criteria for ending isolation have been met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a body temperature over 38.5°C should postpone vaccination until they no longer have a fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE has thoroughly assessed the data on quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine and has recommended its use for people aged 18 and above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety data is currently limited for persons above 60 years of age (due to the small number of participants in clinical trials).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no differences in safety profile of the vaccine in older adults compared to younger age groups can be anticipated, countries considering using this vaccine in persons older than 60 years should maintain active safety monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the EUL process, Sinovac has committed to continuing submit data on safety, efficacy and quality in ongoing vaccine trials and rollout in populations, including in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How efficacious is the vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large phase 3 trial in Brazil showed that two doses, administered at an interval of 14 days, had an efficacy of 51% against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, 100% against severe COVID-19, and 100% against hospitalization starting 14 days after receiving the second dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is the recommended dosage?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends the use of Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine as 2 doses (0.5 ml) given intramuscularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends that a third, additional dose of the Sinovac vaccine be offered to persons aged 60 and above as part of an extension of the primary series. Current data does not indicate the need for an additional dose in persons under 60 years of age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends that severe and moderately immunocompromised persons should be offered an additional dose of vaccine. This is due to the fact that this group is less likely to respond adequately to vaccination following a standard primary vaccination series and are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends an interval of 2–4 weeks between the first and second dose of the primary series. If the second dose is administered less than 2 weeks after the first, the dose does not need to be repeated. If administration of the second dose is delayed beyond 4 weeks, it should be given at the earliest possible opportunity. When administering an additional dose to over 60s, SAGE recommends countries should initially aim at maximizing 2-dose coverage in that population, and thereafter administer the third dose, starting with the oldest age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;Is a booster dose recommended for this vaccine?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;A booster dose may be considered 4 – 6 months after completion of the primary vaccination series, starting with the higher priority-use groups, in accordance with the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of booster vaccination are recognized following increasing evidence of waning vaccine effectiveness against mild and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;Either heterologous (a different vaccine product to Sinovac) or&amp;nbsp;homologous (a booster dose of Sinovac) doses can be used. Studies in Chile and Brazil found that heterologous boosting resulted in superiormore robust immune responses than homologous boosting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can this vaccine be ‘mixed and matched’ with other vaccines?&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE accepts two heterologous doses of WHO EUL COVID-19 vaccines as a complete primary series. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure equivalent or favourable immunogenicity or vaccine effectiveness either of the WHO EUL COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) or the WHO EUL COVID-19 vectored vaccines (AstraZeneca Vaxzevria/COVISHIELD or Janssen) can be used as a second dose following a first dose with the Sinovac vaccine dependant on product availability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it prevent infection and transmission?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no substantive data available related to the impact of COVID-19 vaccine Sinovac-CoronaVac on transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, WHO reminds of the need to stay the course and continue practicing public health and social measures that should be used as a comprehensive approach to prevent infection and transmission. These measures include wearing a mask, physical distancing, handwashing, respiratory and cough hygiene, avoiding crowds and ensuring adequate ventilation according to local national advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it work against new variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an observational study, the estimated effectiveness of Sinovac-CoronaVac in health workers in Manaus, Brazil, where P.1 accounted for 75% of SARS-CoV-2 samples was 49.6% against symptomatic infection (4). Effectiveness has also been shown in an observational study in Sao Paulo in the presence of P1 circulation (83% of samples).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still insufficient data for Omicron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE currently recommends using this vaccine, according to the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How does this vaccine compare to other vaccines already in use?&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We cannot compare the vaccines head-to-head due to the different approaches taken in designing the respective studies, but overall, all of the vaccines that have achieved WHO Emergency Use Listing are highly effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalization due to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 10 June 2022 to ensure consistency of formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be no further updates to this page.

But individuals may choose to delay vaccination for 3 months following the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Should pregnant and breastfeeding women be vaccinated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The available data on the Ad5-nCoV vaccine in pregnant women are insufficient to assess either vaccine efficacy or possible vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. However, based on previous experience with other vaccines during pregnancy, the effectiveness\r\n    of the Ad5-nCoVAd5-nCoV vaccine in pregnant women is expected to be comparable to that observed in non-pregnant women of similar age. Further studies are expected to evaluate safety and immunogenicity in pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the interim, WHO recommends the use of the Ad5-nCoV vaccine in pregnant women when the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant woman outweigh the potential risks. To help pregnant women make this assessment, they should be provided with information\r\n    about the risks of COVID-19 in pregnancy; the likely benefits of vaccination in the local epidemiological context; and the current limitations of safety data in pregnant women. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does\r\n    not recommend delaying pregnancy or considering terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends the same use of Ad5-nCoV vaccine in breastfeeding as in other adults. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding following vaccination.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who is the vaccine not recommended for?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A history of anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine is considered a contraindication to vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with an immediate non-anaphylactic allergic reaction to the first dose (i.e. urticaria, angioedema without respiratory signs or symptoms that occur within 4 hours of administration) should not receive additional doses, unless recommended after\r\n    review by a health professional with specialist expertise. &amp;nbsp;Similarly, anyone who experienced thrombotic thrombocytopenic syndrome (TTS) following the first dose of this vaccine should not receive a second dose of the same vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persons with acute PCR-confirmed COVID-19 should not be vaccinated until after they have recovered from acute illness and the criteria for ending isolation have been met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE has thoroughly assessed the data on quality, safety and efficacy of this vaccine and has recommended its use for people aged 18 and above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), a very rare syndrome of blood clotting combined with low platelet counts, has been reported around 3–30 days following vaccination with Ad5-nCoV.&amp;nbsp; A causal relationship between the vaccine and\r\n    Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome is considered plausible although more evidence is needed to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In countries with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the benefit of vaccination in protecting against COVID-19 far outweighs the risks of TTS. However, benefit–risk assessments may differ from country to country. As part of the EUL process, CanSino\r\n    has committed to continuing submit data on safety, efficacy and quality in ongoing vaccine trials and rollout in populations, including in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How efficacious is the vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical trial data showed that the Ad5-nCoV vaccine had an efficacy of 58% against symptomatic disease and 92% against severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is the recommended dosage?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends the use of Ad5-nCoV vaccine as a single dose (0.5 ml) given intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is a booster recommended for the vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In accordance with the WHO Prioritization Roadmap, a booster dose is recommended for the highest and high priority-use groups (i.e. older adults, health workers, persons with comorbidities), administered 4–6 months after completion of the primary\r\n    series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can this vaccine be ‘mixed and matched’ with other vaccines?&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ad5-nCoV booster dose following a primary series with the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine developed by Sinovac (CoronaVac) was associated with higher vaccine effectiveness compared to a homologous CoronaVac booster. Ad5-nCoV vaccine may be used as a\r\n    booster dose following a completed primary series using any other EUL COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heterologous boosters should take into account current vaccine supply, vaccine supply projections, and other access considerations, alongside the potential benefits and risks of the specific products being used.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it prevent infection and transmission?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As recent data suggest limited effect of the vaccine on transmission, particularly against Omicron, it is advisable that public health and social measures to reduce SARS-CoV‑2 transmission should be considered.&amp;nbsp; These measures include wearing a mask,\r\n    physical distancing, handwashing, respiratory and cough hygiene, avoiding crowds and ensuring adequate ventilation according to local national advice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it work against new variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus?&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The principal clinical trial for this product was completed in January 2021, before the emergence of Delta and Omicron variants. There are still insufficient data for these more recent variants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE currently recommends using this vaccine, according to the WHO Prioritization Roadmap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How does this vaccine compare to other vaccines already in use?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We cannot easily compare vaccines head-to-head due to different approaches taken in designing the respective efficacy and effectiveness studies, but overall, all of the vaccines that have achieved WHO Emergency Use Listing can be considered safe and highly\r\n    effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalization due to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 10 June 2022 to update the latest guidance and ensure consistency of information and formatting.&lt;/em&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be no further updates to this page.

The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/groups/strategic-advisory-group-of-experts-on-immunization/%22"&gt;WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE)&lt;/a&gt; has issued &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-bbv152-covaxin/%22"&gt;interim policy recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for the use of the Bharat Biotech BBV152 COVAXIN vaccine.&amp;nbsp;This article provides a summary of those interim recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who can take this vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is safe and effective for all individuals aged 18 and above. In line with the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Prioritization-2023.1/%22"&gt;WHO Prioritization Roadmap&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/who-sage-values-framework-for-the-allocation-and-prioritization-of-covid-19-vaccination/%22"&gt;WHO Values Framework&lt;/a&gt;, older adults, health workers and immunocompromised persons should be prioritised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vaccine can be offered to people who have had COVID-19 in the past. But individuals may choose to delay vaccination for 3 months following the infection.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should pregnant and breastfeeding women be vaccinated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the adverse consequences of COVID-19 disease during pregnancy, WHO recommends the use of BBV152 in pregnant individuals when the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant person outweigh the potential risks. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends the same use of BBV152 vaccine in breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women. Data are not available on the potential benefits or possible risks of the BBV152 vaccine to breastfed children. However, as BBV152 vaccine is not a live virus vaccine, it is biologically and clinically unlikely to pose a risk to the breastfeeding child. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is the vaccine not recommended for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is not recommended for people younger than 18 years of age. Safety and immunogenicity data for under-18s are currently being generated but until such data are available, vaccination of individuals in this age group is not recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine should not take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persons with acute PCR-confirmed COVID-19 should not be vaccinated until after they have recovered from acute illness and the criteria for ending isolation have been met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a body temperature over 38.5°C should postpone vaccination until they no longer have a fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE has thoroughly assessed the data on safety and efficacy of\r\n    the vaccine and has recommended its use for people aged 18 and above.&amp;nbsp; The\r\n    WHO EUL process also evaluates the quality of manufacturing along with safety\r\n    and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety data is currently limited for persons above 60 years of\r\n    age (due to the small number of participants of this age group in clinical\r\n    trials). However, the trial data indicate that the vaccine has an acceptable\r\n    safety profile for this age group and WHO recommends the vaccine for use in\r\n    persons aged 60 years and over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BBV152 has been licensed for use in 23 countries globally;\r\n    however roll-out has been limited mostly to India where over 77 million doses\r\n    have been distributed and used. Vaccine effectiveness studies are being\r\n    conducted in India, and results will be available in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How efficacious is the vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 of any severity, 14 or more\r\n    days post dose 2, was 78%. Vaccine efficacy against severe disease is 93%. In\r\n    adults aged less than 60 years, efficacy was 79%; and in those aged 60 years\r\n    and over it was 68%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the recommended dosage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends the use of BBV152 vaccine as 2 doses (0.5 ml) given intramuscularly. The vaccine can be administered with an interval of 4 weeks. It is recommended that all vaccinated individuals receive two doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the second dose is inadvertently administered less than 4 weeks after the first, the dose does not need to be repeated. If administration of the second dose is delayed beyond 4 weeks, it should be given at the earliest possible opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE recommends that severe and moderately immunocompromised persons should be offered an additional dose of vaccine. This is due to the fact that this group is less likely to respond adequately to vaccination following a standard primary vaccination series and are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is a booster dose recommended for this vaccine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A booster dose may be offered 4-6 months after completing the\r\n    primary series for the highest-risk groups, for example, older adults, health\r\n    workers, persons with comorbidities. In line with the SAGE Prioritization\r\n    Roadmap, WHO recommends countries should prioritize booster coverage amongst\r\n    higher priority-use groups before offering vaccine doses to lower priority-use\r\n    groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of booster doses are recognized following\r\n    increasing evidence of waning vaccine effectiveness against mild and asymptomatic\r\n    SARS-CoV-2 infection over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can this vaccine be ‘mixed and matched’ with other vaccines? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE accepts two heterologous doses of WHO EUL COVID-19 vaccines as a complete primary series. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure equivalent or favourable immunogenicity or vaccine effectiveness either of the WHO EUL COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) or the WHO EUL COVID-19 vectored vaccines (AstraZeneca Vaxzevria/COVISHIELD or Janssen) can be used as a second dose following a first dose with the Bharat COVID-19 vaccine dependant on product availability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it prevent infection and\r\n        transmission?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine efficacy against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was\r\n    64%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As there is not currently sufficient evidence to date to\r\n    evaluate the impact of the vaccine on transmission, public health and social\r\n    measures must continue, including use of face masks, physical distancing,\r\n    handwashing, appropriate ventilation, and other measures as appropriate in\r\n    particular settings, depending on the COVID-19 epidemiology and potential risks\r\n    of emerging variants. Government advice on public health and social measures\r\n    should continue to be followed by both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.\r\n    SAGE will update this advice as information on the impact of vaccination on\r\n    virus transmission and indirect protection is assessed.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it work against new variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine efficacy against all variant-related COVID-19 disease\r\n    was 71% with an efficacy of 90% against Kappa, and 65% against Delta. In view\r\n    of these findings, WHO recommends the use of BBV152 vaccine according to the\r\n    WHO Prioritization Roadmap, even if currently recognized Variants of Concern\r\n    (VOC) are present in the country. &amp;nbsp;If new VOCs emerge for which vaccine\r\n    performance is compromised, these recommendations will be updated\r\n    accordingly.&amp;nbsp;There are no data yet for Omicron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this vaccine compare to other COVID-19 vaccines already in use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to compare the vaccines head-to-head due to the different approaches taken in designing the respective studies, but overall, all of the vaccines that have achieved WHO Emergency Use Listing are highly effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalization due to COVID-19.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 10 June 2022 to ensure consistency of formatting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 16 March 2022 to reflect the latest guidance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 5 January 2022 to update the latest guidance and ensure consistency of information and formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be no further updates to this page.

In line with the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Prioritization-2023.1/%22"&gt;WHO Prioritization Roadmap&lt;/a&gt; and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/who-sage-values-framework-for-the-allocation-and-prioritization-of-covid-19-vaccination/%22"&gt;WHO Values Framework&lt;/a&gt;, older adults, health workers and immunocompromised persons    should be prioritised.\r\n    &lt;p&gt;The Janssen vaccine can be offered to people who have had COVID-19 in the past. But individuals may wish to choose to delay vaccination for 3 months following the infection.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can immunocompromised persons take the vaccine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persons with immunocompromising conditions are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 and should be vaccinated. The WHO’s Interim recommendations for an extended primary series with an additional vaccine dose for COVID-19 vaccination in immunocompromised persons can be viewed &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE_recommendation-immunocompromised-persons/%22"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends a second dose for all people with immunocompromising conditions aged 18 years and older. Available evidence suggests that this dose should be given 1–3 months after the first dose in order to increase protection as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most appropriate timing for a third dose may vary depending on the epidemiological setting and the extent and timing of immune suppressive therapy, and should be discussed with a Doctor. There are no data available to determine the need and timing of additional doses. As data become available, these recommendations will be updated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Should pregnant women be vaccinated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Janssen vaccine is a nonreplicating vaccine. No safety issues have been identified following vaccination of more than 1,600 pregnant women using this vaccine platform for vaccines against other pathogens, such as the Ebola virus. Animal developmental and reproductive toxicity studies show no harm to the development of the foetus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO has identified pregnant women as a priority-use group for COVID-19 vaccination, given their increased risk of severe outcomes. WHO recommends the use of the Janssen vaccine in pregnancy when the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant person outweigh the potential risks. This assessment should be made with the appropriate information on risks and benefits. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who is the vaccine not recommended for?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine should not take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have had Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (TTS) following the first dose of this vaccine should not receive a second dose of the same vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a body temperature over 38.5ºC should postpone vaccination until they no longer have a fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vaccine is not recommended for persons younger than 18 years of age pending the results of further studies in that age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What’s the recommended dosage?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single dose regimen, in keeping with the EUL recommendations for this vaccine, remains an acceptable option for countries, especially when faced with supply constraints and difficulties to reach remote populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, given the evidence demonstrating improved protection with a second dose, WHO recommends that all efforts should be taken to provide two doses, in particularly to the highest and high priority-use. The administration of the second dose will result in increased protection against symptomatic infection, and against severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What intervals should there be between doses?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;WHO recommends that the second dose should be given 2-6 months after the first dose. Studies show there is improved immunogenicity with longer inter-dose interval and countries could therefore consider an inter-dose interval of up to 6 months.&lt;h3&gt;Is it safe?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE has thoroughly assessed the data on quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine and has recommended its use for people aged 18 and above.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vaccine has also undergone review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and found to be safe for use.&amp;nbsp;A rare serious adverse event is the “thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome” and “Guillain-Barre Syndrome”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How efficacious is the vaccine?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies show that a second dose 2 months after the initial dose substantially increases efficacy, especially against symptomatic infections, including when caused by SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. In the US, the vaccine efficacy of 2 doses, 2 months apart, was 94%. In comparison, the single dose vaccine efficacy in the USA was 72%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in the single dose trial the efficacy against symptomatic disease two months after vaccination had fallen to about 50%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad26.COV2.S has an acceptable reactogenicity profile after both the first dose and second dose, with the reactogenicity post-second dose being similar or milder than post-dose 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it work against&amp;nbsp;new variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE has reviewed all available data on the performance of the vaccine in the settings of the variants of concern. In clinical trials this vaccine has been tested against a variety of SARS-CoV-2 virus variants, including B1.351 (first identified in South Africa) and P.2 (first identified in Brazil), and found to be efficacious. There are no data yet for the performance of this vaccine against the Omicron variant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAGE currently recommends using this vaccine, according to the WHO Prioritization Roadmap, even if variants of concern are present in a country. As new data becomes available, WHO will update recommendations accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Interchangeability between vaccine products and platforms&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;When a second dose is given, it is currently recommended that the same product should be used for both doses.&lt;p&gt;Evolving evidence suggests that heterologous COVID-19 vaccine schedules (using WHO EUL vaccine products from different platforms) may be more immunogenic and effective than homologous schedules, depending on the specific platforms and order of the products used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, data shows that individuals who have received one dose of the Janssen &amp;nbsp;vaccine followed by a second dose of mRNA vaccine have higher neutralising antibody concentrations than individuals who received two doses of the Janssen vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies also show that the Janssen vaccine is as effective in boosting antibodies as a homologous third dose of mRNA vaccine when given six months after a primary two-dose series of mRNA vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Co-administration with inactivated influenza vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 vaccines may be given concomitantly, or any time before or after, other adult vaccines including inactivated influenza vaccines. &lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;Different arms for injection should be used when both vaccines are delivered during the same visit. Continued pharmacovigilance monitoring is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Does it prevent infection and transmission?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no substantive data available related to the impact of Ad26.COV2.S on transmission of virus that causes COVID-19 disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we must maintain and strengthen public health measures that work: masking, physical distancing, handwashing, respiratory and cough hygiene, avoiding crowds and ensuring good ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Adverse Events&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;As of 27 April 2022, more than 50&amp;nbsp; million doses of Ad26.COV2.S have been administered worldwide (the majority of doses in the USA, Europe, South Africa and Brazil).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt;More information is available in the interim recommendations available&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-Ad26.COV2.S-2021.1/%22" style="\&amp;quot;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;and includes the most recent data on any safety concerns, all of which are classified as very rare under the classification set by the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This webpage was updated on 6 June 2022 to include the latest data and to ensure consistency of information and formatting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be no further updates to this page.

More than a quarter of all deaths every year – around 30 000&amp;nbsp;in total – are due to the disease. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypertension – also known as high blood pressure – is a serious medical condition and a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease. People living with hypertension have persistently raised pressure in their blood vessels, which results in\r\n    their hearts having to work much harder. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people with hypertension are unaware of the condition because there are usually no warning signs or symptoms. That is why it is sometimes called a “silent killer”. While hypertension can be detected quickly and easily by a health care\r\n    professional, far too many people are unaware that they are suffering from this condition or are at risk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around one in four men and one in five women live with hypertension in Chile – equivalent to more than four million people. Fortunately, rates of hypertension have been steadily declining during the past years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encouraging progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This decline is the result of sustained action on noncommunicable diseases over a period of several decades in Chile. Hypertension was the focus of the country’s first chronic disease programme run in primary health centres across the country and,\r\n    since the mid-1980s, the country has been working hard to improve the rates of detection and control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the turn of this century, Chile has conducted three national health surveys that collect population data on hypertension. Data has been collected on awareness, prevalence, treatment coverage and types of medication, as well as levels of hypertension\r\n    control. A &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09483-x/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;recent analysis&lt;/a&gt; of these surveys found that hypertension rates have fallen steadily since the first survey. Following the\r\n    creation of national targets, levels of controlled hypertension more than doubled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, hypertension has been included within Chile’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/WHO-HIS-HGF-CaseStudy-15.3/%22"&gt;universal health coverage plan&lt;/a&gt; known as “AUGE”(Universal Access with Explicit Guarantees). This plan gives formal guarantees to people living with hypertension on access to quality care as well as protection\r\n    from financial difficulties as a result of health-care costs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), with support from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, worked with the Ministry of Health of Chile to implement an innovative treatment project in two hypertension clinics.\r\n    This project used an algorithm to treat hypertension which made medicines both more available and affordable; implemented clinical registries to monitor patients with hypertension; and promoted “task-sharing” – the process through\r\n    which local health workers provided services that would otherwise only be available in specialist clinics. This initiative led to improved hypertension management at the primary health care level. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Pedro Ordunez, Advisor for Chronic Diseases at PAHO, this innovative work had three main benefits:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“First, the clinics achieved higher rates of blood pressure control among people living with hypertension. Second, patient data are used to provide feedback to local health centres on how their hypertension services are performing. And third, the project has led to policy improvements in how hypertension medicines are provided, including a pilot of fixed-dose combination medicines that improved adherence to medication.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Global Hearts Initiative &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, Chile was one of the first countries to adopt the WHO &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news/item/15-09-2016-global-hearts-initiative/%22"&gt;Global Hearts Initiative&lt;/a&gt;.\r\n Since its introduction, the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789240001367/%22"&gt;HEARTS technical package&lt;/a&gt; has enabled standardized hypertension treatment to be provided to three million people, in 18 lower- and middle-income countries. Sixteen of these countries are in the Pan American Region, with\r\n    more than 700 health centres involved. Technical support from PAHO to ministries of health across the Region, through the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.paho.org/en/hearts-americas/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;HEARTS in the Americas&lt;/a&gt; Initiative, is helping countries\r\n    like Chile to adopt global best practices to manage hypertension.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of HEARTS, more than half of the health services in Chile use guidelines for managing cardiovascular disease. And a similar proportion of primary health care sites offer “risk stratification” – a tool for identifying\r\n    those most vulnerable to heart disease so that they can receive tailored interventions. As well as reducing rates of hypertension, these activities have led to progress in hypertension control at the population level in Chile. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Still to come &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Anselm Hennis, Director of Noncommunicable Diseases at PAHO, reflects that the results achieved in Chile so far can serve as a blueprint for other countries in the Region:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Chile’s declining hypertension prevalence is the result of sustained commitment for action on noncommunicable diseases. By combining evidence, investment and political priority, Chile is showing us that many of the measures to improve hypertension control not only already exist but are also effective. Chile continues to serve as a shining example of how countries can advance hypertension control, which will not only benefit people living with hypertension, but their families, communities and society as well”. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, action on hypertension is not only critical to prevent more deaths from cardiovascular disease in Chile, but also to improve the quality of lives for the nation’s four million people who still live with hypertension. For this reason, the Ministry\r\n    of Health of Chile has committed to adopt HEARTS in all primary health care centres by 2030.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2017, WHO began a partnership with Resolve to Save Lives, an initiative of Vital Strategies, to support national governments to implement the Global Hearts Initiative. Other partners contributing to the Global Hearts Initiative are: the CDC\r\n    Foundation, the Global Health Advocacy Incubator, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, PAHO and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &amp;nbsp;Since implementation of the programme in 2017 in 18 low- and middle-income\r\n    countries, 3 million people have been put on protocol-based hypertension treatment through person-centred models of care. These programmes demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of standardized hypertension control programmes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//chile-where-action-on-hypertension-is-saving-lives</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//chile-where-action-on-hypertension-is-saving-lives</guid><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news-room/:category?/:language?</route_path><route_name>Newsroom</route_name></route></item><item><title>Vaccine efficacy, effectiveness and protection</title><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution.

Like all vaccines, they do not fully protect everyone who is vaccinated, and&amp;nbsp; we do not yet know how well they can prevent people from transmitting the virus to others. So as well as getting vaccinated, we must also continue with &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/%22"&gt;other measures&lt;/a&gt; to fight the pandemic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine efficacy and effectiveness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt;All COVID-19 vaccines &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/covid-19-vaccines/%22" style="\&amp;quot;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;\&amp;quot;" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt; by WHO for&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/teams/regulation-prequalification/eul/%22"&gt; emergency use listing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt; have been through randomized clinical trials to test their quality, safety and efficacy. To be approved, vaccines are required to have a high efficacy rate of 50% or above. After approval, they continue to be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news/item/17-05-2022-statement-for-healthcare-professionals-how-covid-19-vaccines-are-regulated-for-safety-and-effectiveness/%22"&gt;monitored&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;for ongoing safety and effectiveness. But what is the difference between efficacy and effectiveness?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vaccine’s &lt;strong&gt;efficacy&lt;/strong&gt; is measured in a controlled clinical trial and is based on how many people who got vaccinated developed the ‘outcome of interest’ (usually disease) compared with how many people who got the placebo (dummy vaccine) developed the same outcome. Once the study is complete, the numbers of sick people in each group are compared, in order to calculate the relative risk of getting sick depending on whether or not the subjects received the vaccine. From this we get the efficacy – a measure of how much the vaccine lowered the risk of getting sick. If a vaccine has high efficacy, a lot fewer people in the group who received the vaccine got sick than the people in the group who received the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, for example, let’s imagine a vaccine with a proven efficacy of 80%. This means that – out of the people in the clinical trial – those who received the vaccine were at a 80% lower risk of developing disease&amp;nbsp; than the group who received the placebo. This is calculated by comparing the number of cases of disease in the vaccinated group versus the placebo group. An efficacy of 80% does&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;mean that 20% of the vaccinated group will become ill.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/who-topic-12_efficacy-vs-effectiveness.jpg?sfvrsn=4ff45f33_16&amp;amp;Status=Master\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;100\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/who-topic-12_efficacy.jpg?sfvrsn=efdd88c3_12&amp;amp;Status=Master\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;100\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/who-topic-12_80-percent.jpg?sfvrsn=ef97bc1d_9&amp;amp;Status=Master\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;100\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine &lt;strong&gt;effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt; is a measure of how well vaccines work in the real world. Clinical trials include a wide range of people – a broad age range, both sexes, different ethnicities and those with known medical conditions – but they cannot be a perfect representation of the whole population. The efficacy seen in clinical trials applies to specific outcomes in a clinical trial . Effectiveness is measured by observing how well the vaccines work to protect communities as a whole. Effectiveness in the real world can differ from the efficacy measured in a trial, because we can’t predict exactly how effective vaccination will be for a much bigger and more variable population getting vaccinated in more real life conditions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine protection and timing&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines offer strong protection, but that protection takes time to build. People must take all the required doses of a vaccine to build full immunity. For two-dose vaccines, vaccines only give partial protection after the first dose, and the second dose increases that protection. It takes time before&amp;nbsp;protection reaches its maximum level a few weeks after the second dose. For a one-dose vaccine, people will have built maximum immunity against COVID-19 a few weeks after getting vaccinated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/who-topic-12_time.jpg?sfvrsn=38b2d5fb_14&amp;amp;Status=Master\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;100\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine protection and infection&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines can stop most people from getting sick with COVID-19, but not everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after someone takes all of the recommended doses and waits a few weeks for immunity to build up, there is still a chance that they can get infected. Vaccines do not provide full (100%) protection, so ‘breakthrough infections’ – where people get the virus, despite having been fully vaccinated – will occur.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/who-topic-12_effectiveness.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=812ca477_9\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;100\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If vaccinated people do get sick, they are likely to have milder symptoms, in general 'It is very rare for someone vaccinated to experience severe illness or die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine protection and transmission&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 vaccines are crucial tools in the pandemic response and protect against severe disease and death. Vaccines provide at least some protection from infection and transmission, but not as much as the protection they provide against serious illness and death. More evidence is needed to determine exactly how well they stop infection and transmission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being vaccinated, individuals should continue taking simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Get tested if you are sick, even if you’ve been vaccinated. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/even-if-you-are-vaccinated.png?sfvrsn=1660f73c_9&amp;amp;Status=Master\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;100\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine protection and variants&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When cases increase and transmission accelerates, it’s more likely that &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-effects-of-virus-variants-on-covid-19-vaccines/%22"&gt;new dangerous and more transmissible variants&lt;/a&gt; emerge, which can spread more easily or cause more severe illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on what we know so far, vaccines are proving effective against existing variants, especially at preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death. However, some variants are having a slight impact on the ability of vaccines to guard against mild disease and infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are likely staying effective against variants because of the broad immune response they cause, which means that virus changes or mutations are unlikely to make vaccines completely ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO continues to constantly review the evidence and will update its guidance as we find out more. For the latest updates on what we know about the COVID-19 variants, read our latest &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/%22"&gt;weekly epidemiological updates&lt;/a&gt; and our explainer on ‘&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-effects-of-virus-variants-on-covid-19-vaccines/%22"&gt;the effects of virus variants on COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways of guarding against new variants is to continue applying tried-and-tested public health measures and rolling out vaccines. All COVID-19 vaccines approved for emergency use listing by WHO have been thoroughly tested and proven to provide a high degree of protection against serious illness and death. As stronger virus variants emerge, it’s important to take your vaccine when it’s your turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/take-your-vaccine.png?sfvrsn=4fe09627_11&amp;amp;Status=Master\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;100\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//vaccine-efficacy-effectiveness-and-protection</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//vaccine-efficacy-effectiveness-and-protection</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 11:01:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news-room/:category?/:language?</route_path><route_name>Newsroom</route_name></route></item><item><title>Q&amp;A on malaria elimination in China</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" style="\&amp;quot;width:640px;height:360px;\&amp;quot;" contenteditable="\&amp;quot;false\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;div data-sf-disable-link-event="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;div sf-youtube-url="\&amp;quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoCx9ysYu2Q\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="\&amp;quot;1\&amp;quot;" src="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/embed/OoCx9ysYu2Q?v=OoCx9ysYu2Q&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.who.int&amp;amp;widgetid=3\%22" width="\&amp;quot;640\&amp;quot;" height="\&amp;quot;360\&amp;quot;" frameborder="\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is a WHO certification of malaria elimination?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certification of malaria elimination is the official recognition by WHO of a country’s malaria-free status. WHO grants this certification when a country has demonstrated, with rigorous, credible evidence, that the chain of local transmission of\r\n    all human malaria parasites has been interrupted nationwide for at least the past 3 consecutive years, and that a fully functional surveillance and response system that can prevent re-establishment of indigenous transmission is in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The malaria elimination certification process is voluntary and can only be initiated when a country submits an official request to the WHO Director-General. China initiated the process in November 2020 after reporting 4 consecutive years of zero indigenous\r\n    malaria cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What process did WHO follow to verify China’s malaria-free status?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO has an established process for certifying a country’s malaria-free status. The process is explained briefly on this &lt;a target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" href="https://www.who.int/%22/teams/global-malaria-programme/elimination/certification-process/%22"&gt;webpage &lt;/a&gt;and in greater detail in the publication &lt;a target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789240005624/%22"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preparing for certification of malaria \r\nelimination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This same process is followed for all countries that request a malaria elimination certification from WHO. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" href="https://www.who.int/%22/groups/technical-advisory-group-on-malaria-elimination-and-certification/%22"&gt;Malaria\r\n Elimination Certification Panel &lt;/a&gt;(MECP), an independent WHO advisory body, is tasked with verifying a country’s malaria-free status. After reviewing evidence submitted by countries, analysing independent sources and conducting on-site evaluation\r\n    missions, the panel makes a recommendation to WHO to either certify a country as malaria-free or to postpone certification. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What were the overall impressions of MECP members and their key findings?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MECP evaluation team found that staff at all levels of China’s health system have a sound knowledge of malaria diagnosis and management, reinforced by regular training. They noted that China provides a high quality of care for patients with\r\n    malaria, as well as appropriate treatment regimens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evaluation team found that China has a strong malaria surveillance system capable of reliably detecting imported cases of the disease, together with other measures to reduce the risk of a re-establishment of malaria along its shared border with Myanmar,\r\n    where the disease remains endemic. China’s strong commitment from both the central and provincial governments to maintaining zero malaria cases was also recognized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Which sectors of government – beyond the health sector – contributed to this achievement?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through an agreement signed in 2010, 13 ministries – including those representing health, education, finance, research and science, development, public security, the army, police, commerce, industry and information technology, media and tourism\r\n    – joined forces to end malaria nationwide. Together, they formulated the \"China Malaria Elimination Action Plan (2010-2020)\", which initiated the national malaria elimination programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We realized that it was necessary to cooperate with all relevant departments and involve the whole of society in order to achieve the malaria goals,” notes He Qinghua, Deputy Director-General of the Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control\r\n    at China’s National Health Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working under the guidance of the provincial, county and township administrators, this multisectoral partnership contributed effectively to the elimination of malaria and will continue to play a critical role in the prevention of re-establishment of malaria\r\n    transmission in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What innovative tools or strategies were critical for China to achieve malaria elimination?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of its 7-decade response to malaria, China has been at the forefront of innovation in new tools and strategies for beating back the disease.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1967, the Chinese Government launched the “523 Project”, a research programme aimed at finding new treatments for malaria. This nation-wide effort, involving more than 500 scientists from 60 institutions, led to the discovery in the 1970s\r\n    of artemisinin – the core compound of ACTs (artemisinin-based combination therapies), the most effective antimalarial drugs used today. In recognition of her contributions to the discovery of artemisinin, Chinese Professor Youyou Tu was awarded\r\n    the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in the 1980s, China was one of the first countries to extensively field test insecticide-treated nets, well before they became a WHO-recommended intervention for malaria control. The use of such nets, mainly in the provinces of Sichuan, Guangdong,\r\n    Henan and Jiangsu, led to substantial reductions in malaria incidence in areas where they were deployed.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, China also created and rolled out a highly effective surveillance strategy. Known as “1-3-7”, the strategy includes strict timelines over the course of 7 days to stop malaria in its tracks and prevent onward transmission of\r\n    the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What were some of the other key elements behind China’s success story?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underpinning China’s malaria elimination success was an unwavering political commitment, at all levels of government, to ending the disease over a 70-year period. China’s first malaria control strategy, issued in 1951, noted that Government\r\n    should consider malaria control a “central task” of its administration, and that it should do all it could to reduce the country’s burden of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1956, the goal of national malaria elimination was included in the country’s agriculture and development strategies. By 1957, malaria control stations had been established in 70 counties and cities and pilot malaria control programmes were conducted\r\n    in some provinces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country’s poverty reduction programme, which resulted in significant improvements in housing, living conditions, communications and access to health facilities, also played an important role in this story, particularly in rural areas. The programme\r\n    was launched when the People’s Republic of China was founded in 1949, and further expanded in the late 1970s. Efforts to accelerate poverty reduction have intensified in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China’s commitment to universal health coverage has also been key to success. The country provides a basic public health service package for its residents free of charge; as part of this package, everyone has access to affordable services for the\r\n    diagnosis and treatment of malaria, regardless of legal or financial status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As stated in “Strategies of Healthy China 2030”, a document launched by the State Council in 2016, China will continue to improve access to preventive and curative services by reducing out-of-pocket expenditures and through further investment\r\n    in public health services as well as the strengthening of health personnel training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In recent years, why has Yunnan Province in south-western China been disproportionately affected by malaria?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When China announced a national policy to eliminate malaria in 2010, Yunnan Province had the greatest number of counties considered at risk for the disease. The province offers fertile breeding grounds for mosquitoes during the rainy season and is home\r\n    to a number of species of the mosquito that are vectors for malaria parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yunnan Province also shares a border with 3 malaria-endemic countries: Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam. Myanmar, in particular, carries a substantial malaria burden; during the period 2011-2019, Myanmar was the source of more\r\n    imported malaria cases in China (nearly 5000) than any other country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, under the leadership of the National Health Commission and the Yunnan provincial government, the Yunnan Institute for Parasitic Diseases has worked successfully with the local Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention to\r\n    stamp out indigenous cases of the disease across the province.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What cross-border efforts have been put in place to prevent re-establishment of the disease?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although China has eliminated malaria, the risk of imported cases of the disease remains a key concern, particularly in southern Yunnan Province. To prevent re-establishment of the disease, the country has stepped up its malaria surveillance in at-risk\r\n    zones and has engaged actively in regional malaria control initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At border crossing points to neighbouring countries where malaria is still present, advocacy boards or banners are put up to warn people of the risk of malaria, and leaflets concerning malaria, dengue and other infectious diseases have been made widely\r\n    available. Information on malaria is included in the curriculum of school children, especially in border provinces such as Yunnan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through cross-government agreements, health professionals in China have also collaborated with neighbouring countries to expand support to communities living on the other side of border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China also faces the challenge of imported malaria cases among Chinese nationals returning from sub-Saharan Africa and other malaria-endemic regions. The country’s primary strategy against imported malaria is the maintenance of an effective surveillance\r\n    system that allows for early detection of cases and an appropriate response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How did WHO support China’s malaria elimination effort?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2017, WHO has supported a group of 21 malaria-eliminating countries, including China, through a special initiative called the “E-2020”. A\r\n    &lt;a target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789240024359/%22"&gt;recent report&lt;/a&gt;,\r\n published in April 2021, charts their progress towards a common goal: eliminating malaria within the 2020 timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To guide countries in their elimination journeys, WHO developed the 2017\r\n    &lt;a target="\&amp;quot;_blank\&amp;quot;" href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/9789241511988/%22"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Framework for malaria elimination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,\r\n which outlines the critical requirements needed to achieve and maintain elimination, such as national case-based surveillance systems, quality data management, and robust human and financial resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Framework introduced, for the first time, the concept of verification of subnational malaria elimination, which is particularly relevant for large countries like Brazil, China and Mexico. It also offers guidance on setting targets and systems to verify\r\n    malaria-free areas within a country’s borders, which can help countries prepare for national certification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prepare for its certification, China initiated in 2017 a subnational process whereby individual provinces were verified by the Government as malaria-free. By 2020, all 24 provinces and autonomous regions&amp;nbsp;that were previously malaria endemic  had received national recognition of malaria\r\n    elimination.\r\n    &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//q-a-on-malaria-elimination-in-china</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//q-a-on-malaria-elimination-in-china</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news-room/:category?/:language?</route_path><route_name>Newsroom</route_name></route></item><item><title>PAHO paving the way for COVID-19 vaccination in the Americas</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Following decades of positive experience in forecasting and procuring vaccines and supplies from the Revolving Fund, The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) aligned with WHO and its partners to implement the COVAX Facility in the Americas. The COVID-19\r\n    pandemic represented an unprecedented challenge, and COVAX was the best way for PAHO’s Member States to access safe and effective doses equitably. COVAX doses arrived in Latin America in the first week of March 2021, only two months after high-income\r\n    countries received and applied the first COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 has affected every country, and the beginning of the vaccine rollout has seen countries organizing mass vaccination campaigns. But this is nothing new for the Americas region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="\&amp;quot;800\&amp;quot;" height="\&amp;quot;450\&amp;quot;" src="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rs2VVBJLats/%22" title="\&amp;quot;YouTube" video="" player\"="" frameborder="\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;" allow="\&amp;quot;accelerometer;" autoplay;="" clipboard-write;="" encrypted-media;="" gyroscope;="" picture-in-picture\"="" allowfullscreen="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For four decades the Americas has been a world leader in routine vaccination, vaccine introduction and implementation of mass vaccination campaigns against infectious diseases. The PAHO Revolving Fund – acting on its principles of solidarity and\r\n    Pan-Americanism, equity, quality and transparency – has been working with its Member States to ensure access to vaccines to reach its immunization goals, helping the countries of the Americas to protect people against some of the world's worst\r\n    diseases such as polio, smallpox and measles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Revolving Fund has been key in understanding, collecting and forecasting demand for vaccines. The relationships built through the Revolving Fund and in-country PAHO offices have contributed to national immunization programs now being an integrated\r\n    part of the health systems in the Americas, unlike other regions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Americas is a trailblazer in the introduction of new vaccines, like those against HPV and rotavirus. The political commitment from PAHO Member States in support of immunization has been critical to its success, as has the tireless dedication of health\r\n    care workers who go the extra mile to ensure that every person in every corner of the region is reached by immunization services.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Americas was the first region in the world to eliminate rubella, congenital rubella syndrome and measles; to eradicate smallpox; and to be declared polio-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/departments/department-of-communications/features/paho-paving-the-way-for-covid-19-vaccination-in-the-americas/who_a_009342-.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=856c5a28_31\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;Schoolchildren" march="" through="" the="" streets\"="" sf-size="\&amp;quot;1044688\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;School children march through the streets of Mexico on National Vaccination Day, 15 March 1986 carrying banners in favour of polio immunization. © WHO / Liba Taylor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1987 and 2010, measles elimination efforts led to the implementation of 157 national vaccination campaigns, vaccinating a total of 440 million people of all ages. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean now vaccinate 100 million adults and\r\n    children annually against seasonal flu. The region has extensive experience in adult vaccination and in prioritizing at-risk groups for COVID-19 vaccination such as older adults, health care workers and people with chronic conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Americas — particularly Latin America and the Caribbean — have been hit harder than any other region by COVID-19, with over 1.8 million deaths and more than 69.7 million cases by June 2021. PAHO has operated as Member States’ first\r\n    port of call on all vaccine matters, regardless of whether they have joined the COVAX Facility through the Revolving Fund.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many steps to complete before vaccine doses can be administered in any particular country. PAHO has worked with Member States every step of the way to facilitate transparency and efficiency, enabling equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and\r\n    supporting countries in their preparedness efforts. As vaccine doses become available, countries are ready to receive them and begin equitable distribution immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/departments/department-of-communications/features/paho-paving-the-way-for-covid-19-vaccination-in-the-americas/who_20210315_col_089_1.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=e3a05565_20\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;A" “pop-up\"="" sf-size="\&amp;quot;329977\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fabian Mauricio Niño Terraza, coordinator of the vaccination site, talks to PAHO/WHO Advisor in Family, Gender and Life Course Dr Ivy Lorena Talavera at a “pop-up\" COVID-19 vaccination site in the indigenous community of Concordia, Colombia on 16 March 2021. © WHO / Blink Media - Nadège Masseurs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAHO is working with Member States on vaccine procurement in a variety of ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assisting countries in understanding and preparing to meet the COVAX requirements, including financial, legal, programmatic, regulatory, among others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Updating countries about market dynamics and financial projections to estimate their investment in COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Forecasting and securing supplies related to vaccine administration, such as syringes and safety boxes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensuring that routine immunization programmes are able to continue safely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In those cases where bridge funding is required to access COVID-19 vaccine doses in a timely manner, the Revolving Fund is working with countries to extend financial credits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Channelling down payments to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, for countries with administrative restrictions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;International bidding and joint tender with UNICEF, establishing long-term agreements with suppliers to issue price estimates, purchase orders and requisitions in record time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coordinating and monitoring international logistics for 36 countries in the Americas region.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;As part of the preparations to roll out COVID-19 vaccines, PAHO reviewed countries’ national vaccination and deployment plans, offering feedback and technical assistance in areas such as planning and coordination, cold chain, costing and funding,\r\n    identifying target populations, demand generation and risk communications, delivery strategies and vaccine safety monitoring. This support has continued as countries receive shipments of vaccine doses and begin their rollouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/departments/department-of-communications/features/paho-paving-the-way-for-covid-19-vaccination-in-the-americas/who_20210306_tto_094.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=9bbfdadb_21\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;A" nurse="" administers="" a="" covid-19="" vaccine\"="" sf-size="\&amp;quot;1876150\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rajwantee Lutchman, a registered nurse, administers COVID-19 vaccine to the recipient as part of a vaccination drill conducted on 6 March 2021 at the Siparia District Health Facility in Trinidad and Tobago. © WHO / Blink Media - Kibwe Brathwaite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that the Americas will require vaccination of nearly one billion people in order to stop the spread of the virus. As the COVAX rollout continues and more countries in the region receive shipments of vaccine doses, PAHO will work alongside\r\n    local health authorities, ensuring that every person who is willing and able to be vaccinated receives the required dose.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For over four decades the Americas has been a world leader in routine vaccination and mass vaccination campaigns against infectious diseases. Through PAHO and the COVAX Facility, their efforts will continue throughout the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

Learn more about vaccines – from how they work and how they’re made to ensuring safety and equitable access – in WHO’s &lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines/explainers/%22"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vaccines Explained series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are supported by decades of medical research. They work by preparing the body's own immune system to recognise and defend against a specific disease. The volume of information available about vaccination can be overwhelming, so it’s important\r\n    to talk through the topic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s normal to have questions about vaccines and want to make the right decision for you and your loved ones. If someone you know – a friend, family member or colleague – asks questions or expresses concern about vaccines, listen to\r\n    them, acknowledge their feelings and offer correct information if you can. Be ready to suggest reputable sources of information if they want to learn more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is focused on discussing COVID-19 vaccines but its core lessons are relevant to other vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to have conversations about vaccination&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Listen with empathy &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style="\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Start by listening with empathy to those who have questions around vaccination. Don’t dismiss them, and acknowledge how they’re feeling (without necessarily agreeing, for example “it’s okay to have questions, or want more information\r\n    before getting a vaccine”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccine_01_landscape.jpg?sfvrsn=53b07af_42\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;673235\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Ask open-ended questions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style="\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Ask open-ended questions, such as “What have you heard about the COVID vaccines?” or “Why do you feel that way?”. These questions elicit a response other than “yes” or “no” and can help you better understand\r\n    their concerns, and might also assist the other person in working through their thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccine_02_landscape.jpg?sfvrsn=287a3bd6_26\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;1211755\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Share trusted information&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style="\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;"&gt;When you don’t know the answer or if you’re unsure about how to address their concern, offer to help look for information. Asking for their permission might make them more willing to listen to you rather than feeling like you’re pushing\r\n    unwanted information on them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;"&gt;You can visit the WHO website to find answers to common questions on &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-what-is-vaccination/%22"&gt;vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" data-sf-marked="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" data-sf-marked="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;COVID-19 vaccine safety&lt;/a&gt;. You can also check your local health department website or consult with other trusted and expert sources such as your doctor or nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccine_03_landscape.jpg?sfvrsn=65c4d4a6_26\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;881949\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Explore reasons for wanting to get vaccinated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style="\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;"&gt;When discussing vaccination, nothing works as well as getting personal. Share your own reasons for wanting to get vaccinated and, if you’re in a position to, your experience of vaccination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Talk to them about how getting vaccinated against COVID-19 could offer a path back to normalcy. Explain the benefits of vaccination, whether it’s being able to visit family and friends again, return to the office, get children back to school, spend\r\n    time with classmates or other interactions and activities that have been strained because of COVID-19. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;"&gt;If you previously had concerns that you worked through, and ended up getting vaccinated against COVID-19, share what helped reassure you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Describe how vaccination will help protect you, your family and your community and bring back the activities and pleasures of life that we’ve gone without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccine_04_landscape88a6ab81-ce8e-47cb-a6c6-b9bf54df5d16.jpg?sfvrsn=a4d56d3e_5\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;1532577\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How organizations and vaccinators can help boost vaccine confidence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A range of organizations within and beyond the health sector can play a vital role in sharing accurate information about vaccination and its benefits. Almost everyone can play their part by knowing the basics of vaccination and the reliable sources for\r\n    more details, as well as by openly expressing their enthusiasm for getting vaccinated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Lead by example&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style="\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Organizations and employers can boost confidence by openly sharing their support for vaccination, or personal experience of getting vaccinated. This helps to promote vaccination acceptance as a social norm in the workplace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Build trust&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style="\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;"&gt;If you’re helping to give vaccines, be supportive of anyone coming in for vaccination who has questions or asks for your advice. Listen to any concerns and communicate in a way that is respectful and builds trust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Vaccines are safe, effective and an important part of the COVID-19 response – but stopping the spread of disease remains key. Remind people that they should keep &amp;nbsp;taking other precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping\r\n    rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Break down barriers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style="\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Getting vaccinated often depends on whether or not it’s convenient to do so. To help make vaccination as easy as possible, employers can pay for childcare or the travel costs of getting to vaccination facilities, or offer paid time off for their\r\n    employees to get vaccinated. It’s important to give employees the time and flexibility they need to attend vaccination appointments, and even recover from vaccination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="\&amp;quot;margin-left:30px;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Meanwhile, local civil society organizations and community groups can help people to make vaccination appointments, organize transport or offer any other assistance that might help make it easy for someone to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conversations go a long way in sustaining vaccine confidence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to address people’s concerns about getting vaccinated is to refer them to someone they trust. Remember that these concerns can be emotional for people and touch on issues outside of science, such as their personal experiences\r\n    and their perceptions of poor or unfair treatment in the past. Don’t overwhelm people with facts and information. Instead, acknowledge their perspectives or experiences&amp;nbsp; and speak to their motivations, not what you think they need to hear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination will help keep you, your family and your community safe from COVID-19, and will bring us all closer to doing the things we love with the people we care about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By having thoughtful and kind conversations with people about vaccines and vaccination, you’re making a significant contribution to public health – thank you! &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Further Reading:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-list="\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;" data-level="\&amp;quot;1\&amp;quot;"&gt;●&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Learn more about vaccines – from how they work and how they’re made to ensuring safety and equitable access – in WHO’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines/explainers/%22"&gt;Vaccines Explained series.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 vaccines are safe, and getting vaccinated will help protect you against developing severe COVID-19 disease and dying from COVID-19. You may experience some mild side effects after getting vaccinated, which are signs that your body is building\r\n    protection.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why it’s normal to have mild side effects from vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are designed to give you immunity without the dangers of getting the disease. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.facebook.com/WHO/videos/525963241713633/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;common to experience some mild-to-moderate side effects&lt;/a&gt; when receiving\r\n    vaccinations. This is because your immune system is instructing your body to react in certain ways: it increases blood flow so more immune cells can circulate, and it raises your body temperature in order to kill the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width="\&amp;quot;560\&amp;quot;" height="\&amp;quot;400\&amp;quot;" src="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/embed/xn0pRq84j_M/%22" title="\&amp;quot;YouTube" video="" player\"="" frameborder="\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;" allow="\&amp;quot;accelerometer;" autoplay;="" clipboard-write;="" encrypted-media;="" gyroscope;="" picture-in-picture\"="" allowfullscreen="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mild-to-moderate side effects, like a low-grade fever or muscle aches, are normal and not a cause for alarm: they are signs that the body’s immune system is responding to the vaccine, specifically the antigen (a substance that triggers an immune\r\n    response), and is gearing up to fight the virus. These side effects usually go away on their own after a few days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common and mild or moderate side effects are a good thing: they show us that the vaccine is working. Experiencing no side effects doesn’t mean the vaccine is ineffective. It means everybody responds differently.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Common side effects of COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any vaccine, COVID-19 vaccines can cause side effects, most of which are mild or moderate and go away within a few days on their own. As shown in the results of clinical trials, more serious or long-lasting side effects are possible. Vaccines are\r\n    continually monitored to detect adverse events.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reported side effects of COVID-19 vaccines have mostly been mild to moderate and have lasted no longer thana few days. Typical side effects include pain at the injection site, fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills and diarrhoea. The chances of\r\n    any of these side effects occurring after vaccination differ according to the specific vaccine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 vaccines protect against the SARS-CoV-2 virus only, so it’s still important to keep yourself healthy and well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Less common side effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon receiving the vaccine, a person should be requested to stay for 15–30 minutes at the vaccination site so health workers are available in case of any immediate reactions. Individuals should alert their local health providers following vaccination\r\n    if they experience any unexpected side effects or other health events – such as side effects lasting more than three days. Less common side effects reported for some COVID-19 vaccines have included severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis;\r\n    however, this reaction is extremely rare.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National authorities and international bodies, including WHO, are closely monitoring for any unexpected side effects following COVID-19 vaccine use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Long-term side effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side effects usually occur within the first few days of getting a vaccine. Since the first mass vaccination programme started in early December 2020, hundreds of millions of vaccine doses have been administered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been concerns about COVID-19 vaccines making people sick with COVID-19. But none of the approved vaccines contain the live virus that causes COVID-19, which means that COVID-19 vaccines cannot make you sick with COVID-19.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After vaccination, it usually takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. So it’s possible a person could be infected with SARS-CoV-2 just before or after vaccination and still get sick with\r\n    COVID-19. This is because the vaccine has not yet had enough time to provide protection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiencing side effects after getting vaccinated means the vaccine is working and your immune system is responding as it should. Vaccines are safe, and getting vaccinated will help protect you against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//side-effects-of-covid-19-vaccines</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//side-effects-of-covid-19-vaccines</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2021 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news-room/:category?/:language?</route_path><route_name>Newsroom</route_name></route></item><item><title>Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines</title><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-list="\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;" data-level="\&amp;quot;1\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution.

Vaccine safety is one of WHO’s highest priorities, and we’re working closely with national authorities to develop and implement standards\r\n    to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ensuring safety&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billions of people have been safely vaccinated against COVID-19. All of the approved COVID-19 vaccines have been carefully tested and continue to be monitored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines go through a rigorous, multi-stage testing process, including large clinical trials that involve tens of thousands of people. These trials are specifically designed to identify any safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/groups/strategic-advisory-group-of-experts-on-immunization/covid-19-materials/%22"&gt;An external panel of experts&lt;/a&gt; convened by\r\n    WHO analyses the results from clinical trials and recommends whether and how the vaccines should be used.

The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgNL_9ktUmY&amp;amp;list=PL9S6xGsoqIBXHSDMCp8CjOmhULeQnJ_7J&amp;amp;index=10\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;mRNA vaccine technology&lt;/a&gt; has been studied for over a decade, including in the development of vaccines for Zika, rabies and influenza.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mRNA vaccines have been rigorously assessed for safety, and clinical trials have shown that they provide a long-lasting immune response. mRNA vaccines are not live virus vaccines and do not interfere with human DNA. For more information on mRNA\r\n    vaccines, see WHO’s explainer on the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-race-for-a-covid-19-vaccine-explained/%22"&gt;different types of COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Safety of COVID-19 vaccines for different groups&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 vaccines have been tested in large, randomized controlled trials that include people of a broad age range, all sexes, different ethnicities, and those with known medical conditions. The vaccines have shown a high level of efficacy across all\r\n    populations.\r\n    &lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Vaccines have been found to be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8Remuje4bs&amp;amp;list=PL9S6xGsoqIBXHSDMCp8CjOmhULeQnJ_7J&amp;amp;index=8\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" style="\&amp;quot;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;\&amp;quot;"&gt;safe and effective in people with various underlying medical conditions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt; that are associated with increased risk of severe disease. These include high blood pressure; diabetes; asthma; pulmonary, liver or kidney disease; and chronic infections that are stable and controlled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who should consult with a doctor before vaccination include people with a compromised immune system, older people with severe frailty, people with a history of severe allergic reaction to vaccines, people living with HIV, and those who are pregnant\r\n    or breastfeeding. For more information about vaccine safety for different groups, please see our Q&amp;amp;A on COVID-19 vaccine safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Pregnancy&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;You can get vaccinated whilst you are pregnant. During pregnancy, you are at higher risk of serious illness caused by COVID-19. You are also at higher risk of delivering your baby prematurely if you contract COVID-19. While there is less data available on vaccination of pregnant people, evidence on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy has been growing, and no safety concerns have been identified. Especially in countries with high transmission, or if you have an occupation where you are at more risk of being exposed to COVID-19, the benefits of getting the vaccine outweigh potential risks. There is no risk of getting COVID-19 from the vaccine. Talk to your healthcare provider to make an informed decision about vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-FAQ-Pregnancy-Vaccines-2022.1/%22"&gt;Questions and Answers: COVID-19 vaccines and pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;font-size:14px;font-weight:700;text-align:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Breastfeeding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are breastfeeding, you should get vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as it is your turn. None of the current COVID-19 vaccines have live virus in them. This means there is no risk of you transmitting COVID-19 to your baby through your breastmilk from the vaccine.&amp;nbsp; In fact, the antibodies you get after vaccination may go through your breast milk and help to protect your baby.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Safety of COVID-19 vaccines for children&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer vaccine is safe for use in children aged 5 years and above. For children in this age group, WHO recommends a reduced dosage of 10 µg (0.2 ml). Both Pfizer and Moderna are safe for use in children aged 12 and above using a dose of 0.3 ml and 0.5 ml respectively.&amp;nbsp; However, while the availability of COVID-19 vaccines is limited, WHO recommends that countries should vaccinate children only when high vaccine coverage with two doses has been achieved in higher priority-use groups, as identified in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Prioritization-2023.1/%22"&gt;WHO Prioritization Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;However, children with existing health conditions should be prioritised for vaccination at the same time as other high risk groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine trials to determine whether other COVID-19 vaccines are safe for use in children are ongoing, and WHO recommendations will be updated when the evidence supports a change in the policy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practicing the protective behaviours is still the best way to keep everyone, including children, safe from COVID-19, whether or not you have been vaccinated. Keep a safe distance from others, avoid crowds, wear a well-fitting mask covering your mouth and nose, keep indoor spaces well ventilated, clean hands regularly and cover coughs and sneezes, as well as getting vaccinated as soon as it’s your turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This page was updated on 21 January 2022 to reflect updates in the latest guidance relating to the vaccination of children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//safety-of-covid-19-vaccines</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//safety-of-covid-19-vaccines</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2021 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news-room/:category?/:language?</route_path><route_name>Newsroom</route_name></route></item><item><title>Getting the COVID-19 Vaccine</title><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-list="\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;" data-level="\&amp;quot;1\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution.

After vaccination, the body is ready to fight the virus if it is later exposed to it, thereby preventing\r\n    illness.\r\n    &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, develop an immune response within the first few weeks, but we are still learning how strong and lasting that immune response is, and how it varies between different people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2UUBQSOVDc&amp;amp;list=PL9S6xGsoqIBXHSDMCp8CjOmhULeQnJ_7J&amp;amp;index=10&amp;amp;ab_channel=WorldHealthOrganization%28WHO%29\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;already been infected with SARS-CoV-2 should still get vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; unless told otherwise by their health care provider. Even if you’ve had a previous infection, the vaccine acts as a booster that strengthens the immune response. There have also been some instances of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 a second\r\n    time, which makes getting vaccinated even more important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-explained_topic-9_getting-vaccinated_immunity.jpg?sfvrsn=8ce6d69b_34\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;470767\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What to expect during vaccination&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical professionals can best advise individuals on whether or not, and when, they should receive a vaccine. A health worker will administer the vaccine, and the person receiving it will be asked to wait for 15–30 minutes before leaving the vaccination\r\n    site. This is so that health workers can observe individuals for any unexpected reactions following vaccination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any vaccine, COVID-19 vaccines can cause mild-to-moderate side effects, such as a low-grade fever or pain or redness at the injection site. These should go away on their own within a few days.

Scientists call this priming the immune response. The second dose acts\r\n    as a booster, ensuring the immune system develops a memory response to fight off the virus if it encounters it again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the urgent need for a COVID-19 vaccine, initial clinical trials of vaccine candidates were performed with the shortest possible duration between doses. Therefore an interval of 21–28 days (3–4 weeks) between doses is recommended\r\n    by WHO. Depending on the vaccine, the interval may be extended for up to 42 days – or even up to 12 weeks for some vaccines – on the basis of current evidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many COVID-19 vaccines being developed and produced by different manufacturers around the world. WHO recommends that a vaccine from the same manufacturer be used for both doses if you require two doses. This recommendation may be updated as\r\n    further information becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Safety against infection and transmission after vaccination&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available clinical trials have shown COVID-19 vaccines to be safe and highly effective at preventing severe disease. Given how new COVID-19 is, researchers are still looking into how long a vaccinated person is likely to be protected from infection, and\r\n    whether vaccinated people can still transmit the virus to others. As the vaccine rollout expands, WHO will continue to monitor the data alongside regulatory authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/maskwearing_landscape_en.jpg?sfvrsn=f38fd78e_31\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;458672\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safe and effective vaccines are making a significant contribution to preventing severe disease and death from COVID-19. As vaccines are rolling out and immunity is building, it is important to continue to follow all of the recommended measures that reduce\r\n    the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This includes physically distancing yourself from others; wearing a mask, especially in crowded and poorly ventilated settings; cleaning your hands frequently; covering any cough or sneeze in your bent elbow; and opening\r\n    windows when indoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//getting-the-covid-19-vaccine</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//getting-the-covid-19-vaccine</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2021 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news-room/:category?/:language?</route_path><route_name>Newsroom</route_name></route></item><item><title>WHO advises that ivermectin only be used to treat COVID-19 within clinical trials</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The current evidence on the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 patients is inconclusive. Until more data is available, WHO recommends that the drug only be used within clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This recommendation, which applies to patients with COVID-19 of any disease severity, is now part of WHO’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/therapeutics-and-covid-19-living-guideline/%22"&gt;guidelines on COVID-19 treatments&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ivermectin is a broad spectrum anti-parasitic agent, included in &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://list.essentialmeds.org/medicines/58/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;WHO essential medicines list&lt;/a&gt; for several parasitic diseases. It is used in the treatment of onchocerciasis (river blindness), strongyloidiasis and other diseases caused by soil transmitted helminthiasis. It is also used to treat scabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A guideline development group was convened in response to the increased international attention on ivermectin as a potential treatment for COVID-19. This group is an independent, international panel of experts, which includes clinical care experts in multiple specialties and also include an ethicist and patient-partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group reviewed pooled data from 16 randomized controlled trials (total enrolled 2407), including both inpatients and outpatients with COVID-19. They determined that the evidence on whether ivermectin reduces mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, need for hospital admission and time to clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients is of “very low certainty,” due to the small sizes and methodological limitations of available trial data, including small number of events.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel did not look at the use of ivermectin to prevent COVID-19, which is outside of scope of the current guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;text-decoration:underline;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Note to the editor:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous recommendations on the use of therapeutics for COVID-19:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong recommendation for the use systemic &lt;strong&gt;corticosteroids&lt;/strong&gt; for severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients; with a conditional recommendation against their use in patients with mild/moderate COVID-19&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conditional recommendation against administering &lt;strong&gt;remdesivir&lt;/strong&gt; in addition to usual care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong recommendation against the use of &lt;strong&gt;hydroxychloroquine&lt;/strong&gt; or chloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 of any severity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong recommendation against administering &lt;strong&gt;lopinavir/ritonavir&lt;/strong&gt; for treatment of COVID-19 of any severity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conditional recommendation for the use of low dose &lt;strong&gt;anticoagulants&lt;/strong&gt; in hospitalized patients (this recommendation is part of the  &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://cms.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-clinical-2021-1/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" data-sf-marked="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;clinical management guidelines&lt;/a&gt;).

Being a refugee hasn’t made her life easier. Until recently, Aseel used a stroller as a makeshift wheelchair and struggled to get around and stay engaged in the classroom because the stroller hurt her back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to WHO’s work on globalizing wheelchair guidelines, and UNICEF’s disability-focused programmes, a wheelchair of appropriate size and design was provided to Aseel to help her be included in school activities and move around more easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Aseel, many people in the world today lack access to appropriate assistive technology. WHO estimates that out of the one billion people needing at least one assistive product, nine in ten go without. Children with injuries living in low- and middle-income or fragile countries mostly depend on donated wheelchairs, which are often of poor quality and inappropriate for the user or their environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The barriers are manifold, but mostly they have to do with the cost and availability of assistive products, the lack of harmonized specifications, broken supply systems, and the fact that society is still not as inclusive of persons with disabilities as it needs to be. The result for many people in low- and middle-income countries: either no access or only access to low-quality, inappropriate products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new global guide to expand access to quality assistive products &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address some of those barriers, WHO has created the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/339851/9789240020283-eng.pdf/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Assistive Products Specifications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(APS) a guidebook with specs for 26 prioritized assistive products that describes the minimum quality requirements for manufacturing. Funded by UK Aid under Global Disability Innovation Hub’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://at2030.org//%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;AT2030&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;programme, the APS supports a focus on innovative products, new service models, and global capacity to drive disability innovation for a fairer world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This first compilation of the APS includes products selected from the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/207694/WHO_EMP_PHI_2016.01_eng.pdf?sequence=1\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Priority assistive products list&lt;/a&gt; and covers mobility, hearing, vision, communication, cognition and self-care. The products range from clubfoot braces and wheelchairs to hearing aids, alarm signalers and audio-players. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main aim of the APS is to ensure countries get supply of good quality and affordable assistive products for all who need them. Each APS in the compilation describes the functional and performance requirements that can be used as a model to guide manufacturing and procurement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, WHO and UNICEF will issue a joint tender for wheelchair and hearing aids and will ensure the products reach those who need them. The two agencies have already identified and are working with assistive technology manufacturers to ensure the specs are followed and that production and supply can be cost-effective for both bulk buyers and individuals. Both organizations will also support countries with training to adapt their national standards to improve access to quality, life-changing health products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appropriate assistive technology can have a direct impact on the well-being of children and adults of all ages by supporting their functionality and inclusion into society, thereby increasing the opportunities for education, employment and social engagement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a proper use of hearing aids leads young children to improved language skills. Or, an appropriate wheelchair - like the one given to Aseel - can increase the chances of people completing their education, finding employment and engaging in social activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The APS is the first global guide for quality-assured assistive products and will be updated on a regular basis. Quality assistive technology for all is the ultimate aim of this guide-book, and improved well-being for millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO work on assistive technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO works to change the landscape of access to assistive technology through a multi-pronged approach based on human rights, universal health coverage and the realities of low- and middle-income countries. In 2016, it issued the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/207694/WHO_EMP_PHI_2016.01_eng.pdf?sequence=1\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Priority assistive products list&lt;/a&gt;, a compilation of the 50 most essential assistive products, selected based on a survey done with persons living with disabilities and their carers. WHO has been active in wheelchair provision since 2004 and introduced the Wheelchair Guidelines, training and wheelchair provision standards.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNICEF work on assistive technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNICEF focuses on three key activities to ensure disability-inclusive supplies are available and accessible worldwide. First, the organization is analyzing and updating its products in the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://supply.unicef.org//%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;UNICEF Supply Catalogue&lt;/a&gt; to ensure they are disability-friendly. Second, UNICEF is introducing new assistive technology to programmes worldwide, such as the new &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.unicef.org/supply/stories/inclusive-innovation-transforms-standard-latrine-disability-friendly-solution/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;disability-friendly latrine&lt;/a&gt;. This work involves collaborating with WHO and partners to develop guidance for AT suppliers who produce products and humanitarian staff who procure the products. Finally, UNICEF is increasing advocacy efforts to gain a global consensus for assistive technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO-UNICEF Joint Action Plan on Assistive Technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve access to assistive technology for everyone, everywhere, on 28 July 2020, WHO and UNICEF signed a Joint Action Plan on Assistive Technology and included provision of assistive products under the Strategic Collaboration Framework between The World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund to bring a catalytic impact and provide quality assistive products to the 900 million people that are lacking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK Aid’s AT2030 led by Global Disability Innovation Hub (GDI Hub) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT2030 tests ‘what works’ to improve access to AT and support solutions to scale. With a focus on innovative products, new service models, and global capacity support, the programme aims to reach 9 million people directly and 6 million more indirectly to enable a lifetime of potential through life-changing assistive technology. GDI Hub is a research and practice centre driving disability innovation for a fairer world. Operational in 35 countries, the GDI Hub develops bold approaches, partnerships and ecosystems to accelerate change.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information at &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://at2030.org//%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;https://at2030.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//first-ever-global-guide-for-assistive-technology-to-improve-the-life-of-millions</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//first-ever-global-guide-for-assistive-technology-to-improve-the-life-of-millions</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news-room/:category?/:language?</route_path><route_name>Newsroom</route_name></route></item><item><title>The effects of virus variants on COVID-19 vaccines</title><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution. Learn more about vaccines – from how they work and how they’re made to ensuring safety and equitable access – in WHO’s &lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines/explainers/%22"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vaccines Explained series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All viruses – including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 – evolve over time. When a virus replicates or makes copies of itself, it sometimes changes a little bit, which is normal for a virus. These changes are called “mutations”.\r\n    A virus with one or more new mutations is referred to as a “variant” of the original virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes a virus to change to a new variant?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a virus is widely circulating in a population and causing many infections, the likelihood of the virus mutating increases. The more opportunities a virus has to spread, the more it replicates – and the more opportunities it has to undergo changes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" contenteditable="\&amp;quot;false\&amp;quot;" style="\&amp;quot;width:560px;height:315px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;div data-sf-disable-link-event="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;iframe width="\&amp;quot;560\&amp;quot;" height="\&amp;quot;315\&amp;quot;" src="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/embed/qD8dAbov5JU/%22" frameborder="\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;" allowfullscreen="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most viral mutations have little to no impact on the virus’s ability to cause infections and disease. But depending on where the changes are located in the virus’s genetic material, they may affect a virus’s properties, such as transmission\r\n    (for example, it may spread more or less easily) or severity (for example, it may cause more or less severe disease).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What impact do the new variants of the COVID-19 virus have on vaccines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 vaccines that are currently in development or have been approved are expected to provide at least &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1351587623920410624?s=20\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;some protection against new virus variants&lt;/a&gt; because\r\n    these vaccines elicit a broad immune response involving a range of antibodies and cells. Therefore, changes or mutations in the virus should not make vaccines completely ineffective. In the event that any of these vaccines prove to be less effective\r\n    against one or more variants, it will be possible to change the composition of the vaccines to protect against these variants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data continues to be collected and analysed on new variants of the COVID-19 virus. WHO is working with researchers, health officials and scientists to understand how these variants affect the virus’s behaviour, including their impact on\r\n    the effectiveness of vaccines, if any. See &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/disease/novel_coronavirus/en//%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" data-sf-marked="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;WHO’s Disease Outbreak News&lt;/a&gt; to get up-to-date information on the impact of COVID-19\r\n    virus variants on the effectiveness of the different vaccines. This is an area where the evidence remains preliminary and is developing quickly.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we are learning more,&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/science-in-5/episode-20---covid-19---variants-vaccines/%22"&gt; we need to do everything possible to stop the spread of the virus in order to prevent mutations that may reduce the efficacy of existing vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.\r\n In addition, manufacturers and the programmes using the vaccines may have to adjust to the evolution of the COVID-19 virus: for example, vaccines may need to incorporate more than one strain when in development, booster shots may be required, and\r\n    other vaccine changes may be needed. Trials must also be designed and maintained to allow any changes in efficacy to be assessed, and must be of sufficient scale and diversity to enable clear interpretation of results. Studies of the impact of vaccines\r\n    as they are deployed are also essential in order to understand their impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is WHO doing to monitor and understand the impact of virus variants on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO has been tracking mutations and variants since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our global SARS-CoV-2 laboratory network includes a dedicated Virus Evolution Working Group, which aims to detect new changes quickly and assess their possible impact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research groups have carried out genomic sequencing of the COVID-19 virus and shared these sequences on public databases, including &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.gisaid.org//%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;GISAID&lt;/a&gt;. This global collaboration allows scientists to better\r\n    track how the virus is changing. WHO recommends that all countries increase the sequencing of the COVID-19 virus where possible and share data to help one another monitor and respond to the evolving pandemic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO has also established a SARS-CoV-2 Risk Monitoring and Evaluation Framework to identify, monitor and assess variants of concern. It will involve components like surveillance, research on variants of concern, and evaluation of the impact on diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.\r\n    The framework will serve as a guide for manufacturers and countries on changes that may be needed for COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can we prevent future new variants of the COVID-19 virus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9COT-kR6NFA&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;ab_channel=WorldHealthOrganization%28WHO%29\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Stopping the spread at the source remains key.&lt;/a&gt; Current measures to reduce transmission – including\r\n    frequent hand washing, wearing a mask, physical distancing, good ventilation and avoiding crowded places or closed settings – continue to work against new variants by reducing the amount of viral transmission and therefore also reducing opportunities\r\n    for the virus to mutate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" contenteditable="\&amp;quot;false\&amp;quot;" style="\&amp;quot;width:560px;height:315px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;div data-sf-disable-link-event="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;iframe width="\&amp;quot;560\&amp;quot;" height="\&amp;quot;315\&amp;quot;" src="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/embed/01b-74ljqWc/%22" frameborder="\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;" allowfullscreen="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scaling up vaccine manufacturing and rolling out vaccines as quickly and widely as possible will also be critical ways of protecting people before they are exposed to the virus and the risk of new variants. Priority should be given to vaccinating high-risk\r\n    groups everywhere to maximize global protection against new variants and minimize the risk of transmission. Moreover, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/feature-stories/detail/access-and-allocation-how-will-there-be-fair-and-equitable-allocation-of-limited-supplies/%22"&gt;ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; is more critical than ever to address\r\n    the evolving pandemic. As more people get vaccinated, we expect virus circulation to decrease, which will then lead to fewer mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" contenteditable="\&amp;quot;false\&amp;quot;" style="\&amp;quot;width:560px;height:315px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;div data-sf-disable-link-event="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;iframe width="\&amp;quot;560\&amp;quot;" height="\&amp;quot;315\&amp;quot;" src="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/embed/xLvY210yQkE/%22" frameborder="\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;" allowfullscreen="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is it important to get vaccinated even if there are new variants of the virus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are a critical tool in the battle against COVID-19, and there are clear public health and lifesaving benefits to using the tools we already have. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV2JF2jfpiY&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;ab_channel=WorldHealthOrganization%28WHO%29\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;We must not put off getting vaccinated because of our concerns about new variants,&lt;/a&gt; and we must proceed with vaccination even if the vaccines may be somewhat less effective against some of the COVID-19 virus variants.

The AMC, combined with additional support for country readiness and delivery, will make sure the most vulnerable in all countries can be protected in the short term, regardless of income level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These AMC92 countries must develop a COVID-19 National Deployment and Vaccination Plans (NDVPs) which is reviewed by WHO, UNICEF and other partners to help the country be sure the plan is as good as it can be. NDVPs can be submitted through the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://covid19partnersplatform.who.int/en//%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Partners Platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a country's NDVP is reviewed to ensure the key readiness criteria are met, they can be allocated vaccines through the  &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/initiatives/act-accelerator/covax/%22"&gt;COVAX&lt;/a&gt; Facility. Non-AMC countries are also welcome to submit their NDVP for review and receive feedback to strengthen their plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/illustration-3---country-readiness---ndvp.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=27db0585_33\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;2054999\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is a National Deployment and Vaccination Plan?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A National Deployment and Vaccination Plan is an operational plan to implement and monitor COVID-19 vaccination rollout in a country. The NDVP serves as the “one-country plan” and main framework for a country’s vaccine introduction and vaccination efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NDVP outlines key aspects of readiness, including:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-list="\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;" data-level="\&amp;quot;1\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory preparedness:&lt;/strong&gt; legal requirements for importing vaccines, regulatory authorization for using vaccines, and procedures to expedite vaccine availability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning and coordination:&lt;/strong&gt; governance and management structure at both country (such as a national coordinating committee and national immunization technical advisory groups) and subnational levels to oversee the deployment, implementation and monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costing and funding:&lt;/strong&gt; a realistic budget – including funding sources and budget gaps – for vaccine deployment and vaccination&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target populations and vaccination strategies:&lt;/strong&gt; order of priority for different population groups to receive vaccination and how each group will be vaccinated&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply chain and health care waste management:&lt;/strong&gt; critical supply chain activities to prepare for vaccine deployment (such as cold chain assessment and secure distribution and logistics) and to ensure safe handling of health care waste&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human resources management and training:&lt;/strong&gt; staff requirements for the vaccine rollout and a plan for training and supervision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccine acceptance and demand:&lt;/strong&gt; an integrated approach to achieve high uptake of COVID-19 vaccines, including strategic communication activities that promote vaccination, manage misinformation and convey risk in the event of any adverse effects&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccine safety:&lt;/strong&gt; steps to prepare for, monitor and address vaccine safety and potential adverse events and ensure injection safety&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immunization monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt; a strategy for collection and reporting of immunization data, disease surveillance to monitor vaccine impact, and evaluation of the overall implementation process&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each country’s NDVP should be developed through a consultative process, led by the country’s Ministry of Health and supported by other organizations, including WHO, UNICEF and other relevant partners, to fine-tune the plan until it is complete. The Country Readiness and Delivery workstream of the ACT Accelerator has issued   &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://cms.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccine_deployment-2020.1/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" data-sf-marked="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;guidance on developing a national deployment and vaccination plan for COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, which helps countries produce their plan for COVID-19 vaccine introduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why should countries develop a National Deployment and Vaccination Plan?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing an NDVP helps countries prepare for COVID-19 vaccination, identify resource needs and streamline the process for introducing vaccines. Once an NDVP is developed, countries work on its implementation, including the detailed planning of&amp;nbsp; vaccine delivery strategies, logistics, HR and funding mobilization.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How will country readiness be assessed?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A review process has been set up to provide support and feedback to countries for improving and finalizing their plans. This ensures that a country’s NDVP includes the necessary elements to rapidly deploy vaccines and implement COVID-19 vaccination, and that any recommendations for improvement are addressed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once an AMC92 participant submits its NDVP, a Regional Review Committee (RRC) assesses the plan and evaluates country preparedness and capacity for &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/m/item/allocation-mechanism-for-covax-facility-vaccines-explainer/%22"&gt;vaccine allocation&lt;/a&gt;, deployment and administration. Those participants with an NDVP that meets the standardized readiness assessment join the process for allocating COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX Facility. Countries should take into account the recommendations from the review to further improve their preparedness for vaccine introduction.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//country-readiness-for-covid-19-vaccines</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//country-readiness-for-covid-19-vaccines</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news-room/:category?/:language?</route_path><route_name>Newsroom</route_name></route></item><item><title>WHO recommends follow-up care, low-dose anticoagulants for COVID-19 patients</title><description>&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends that patients who have COVID-19 - both confirmed and suspected - should have access to follow-up care if they have persistent, new or changing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one of the recommendations made by WHO in revised clinical management guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence was gathered on the post COVID condition, so-called ‘long COVID’, where people who have recovered from COVID-19 continue to have longer-term issues like extreme fatigue, persistent cough and exercise intolerance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding this condition is one of WHO’s priority areas of work. In February 2021, WHO will organize a series of consultations to reach consensus on a description of this condition and its subtypes, and case definitions. This scientific understanding\r\n    will inform the name of the condition. The consultations will include a broad range of stakeholders, including patient groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For COVID-19 patients at home, WHO suggests the use of pulse oximetry to measure oxygen levels in the blood. This needs to be coordinated with other aspects of home care, such as education for the patient and care provider and regular follow-up of the\r\n    patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For hospitalized patients, WHO suggests the use of low dose anticoagulants for preventing the blood clots forming in blood vessels (thrombosis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For hospitalized patients who are taking supplemental oxygen (including high-flow nasal oxygen) or non-invasive ventilation, WHO suggests positioning patients on their stomachs to increase oxygen flow (awake prone positioning).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines also include recommendations on the use of care bundles to systematize care provision for COVID-19 patients, as well as a recommendation to favour clinical judgement over models in making decisions for the patient’s care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommendations were made by an independent panel of experts, the Guideline Development Group, on the basis of detailed rapid reviews of all available evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines are a living document, updated regularly as more data becomes available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//who-recommends-follow-up-care-low-dose-anticoagulants-for-covid-19-patients</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//who-recommends-follow-up-care-low-dose-anticoagulants-for-covid-19-patients</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jan 2021 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news-room/:category?/:language?</route_path><route_name>Newsroom</route_name></route></item><item><title>The different types of COVID-19 vaccines</title><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution.

Of these, at least 52 candidate vaccines are in human trials. There are several others currently in phase I/II, which will enter phase III in the coming months\r\n        (for more information on the clinical trial phases, see part three of our Vaccine Explained series).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why are there so many vaccines in development?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, many vaccine candidates will be evaluated before any are found to be both safe and effective. For example, of all the vaccines that are studied in the lab and laboratory animals, roughly 7 out of every 100 will be considered good enough\r\n        to move into clinical trials in humans. Of the vaccines that do make it to clinical trials, just one in five is successful. Having lots of different vaccines in development increases the chances that there will be one or more successful vaccines\r\n        that will be shown to be safe and efficacious for the intended prioritized populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-custom-thumbnail="\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;" src="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-topics-four-images-working-01.jpg?sfvrsn=fdb5276_37\%22" style="\&amp;quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;" sf-constrain-proportions="\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;" width="\&amp;quot;600\&amp;quot;" alt="\&amp;quot;Vaccines" topics="" four="" images="" working="" 01\"="" sf-size="\&amp;quot;898037\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The different types of vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three main approaches to designing a vaccine. Their differences lie in whether they use a &lt;strong&gt;whole&lt;/strong&gt; virus or bacterium; just the &lt;strong&gt;parts&lt;/strong&gt; of the germ that triggers the immune system; or just the &lt;strong&gt;genetic material&lt;/strong&gt; that provides the instructions for making specific proteins and not the whole virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-custom-thumbnail="\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;" src="https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-topics-four-images-working-02.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=d4d31bb1_31\%22" style="\&amp;quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;" sf-constrain-proportions="\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;" width="\&amp;quot;600\&amp;quot;" alt="\&amp;quot;Vaccines" topics="" four="" images="" working="" 02\"="" sf-size="\&amp;quot;1079883\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The whole-microbe approach&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inactivated vaccine&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first way to make a vaccine is to take the disease-carrying virus or bacterium, or one very similar to it, and inactivate or kill it using chemicals, heat or radiation. This approach uses technology that’s been proven to work in people –\r\n        this is the way the flu and polio vaccines are made – and vaccines can be manufactured on a reasonable scale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it requires special laboratory facilities to grow the virus or bacterium safely, can have a relatively long production time, and will likely require two or three doses to be administered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live-attenuated vaccine &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;A live-attenuated vaccine uses a living but weakened version of the virus or one that’s very similar. The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and the chickenpox and shingles vaccine are examples of this type of vaccine.\r\n        This approach uses similar technology to the inactivated vaccine and can be manufactured at scale. However, vaccines like this may not be suitable for people with compromised immune systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viral vector vaccine &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This type of vaccine uses a safe virus to deliver specific sub-parts – called proteins – of the germ of interest so that it can trigger an immune response without causing disease. To do this, the instructions for making\r\n        particular parts of the pathogen of interest are inserted into a safe virus. The safe virus then serves as a platform or vector to deliver the protein into the body.&amp;nbsp; The protein triggers the immune response. The Ebola vaccine is a viral\r\n        vector vaccine and this type can be developed rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The subunit approach&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-custom-thumbnail="\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;" src="https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-topics-four-images-working-03.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=d795a4d1_31\%22" style="\&amp;quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;548291\&amp;quot;" width="\&amp;quot;600\&amp;quot;" alt="\&amp;quot;Vaccines" topics="" four="" images="" working="" 03\"="" sf-constrain-proportions="\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A subunit vaccine is one that only uses the very specific parts (the subunits) of a virus or bacterium that the immune system needs to recognize. It doesn't contain the whole microbe or use a safe virus as a vector. The subunits may be proteins or\r\n        sugars. Most of the vaccines on the childhood schedule are subunit vaccines, protecting people from diseases such as whooping cough, tetanus, diphtheria and meningococcal meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img sf-custom-thumbnail="\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;" src="https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-topics-four-images-working-04.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=f5f33baa_30\%22" style="\&amp;quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;493676\&amp;quot;" width="\&amp;quot;600\&amp;quot;" alt="\&amp;quot;Vaccines" topics="" four="" images="" working="" 04\"="" sf-constrain-proportions="\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The genetic approach (nucleic acid vaccine)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike vaccine approaches that use either a weakened or dead whole microbe or parts of one, a nucleic acid vaccine just uses a section of genetic material that provides the instructions for specific proteins, not the whole microbe. DNA and RNA are\r\n        the instructions our cells use to make proteins. In our cells, DNA is first turned into messenger RNA, which is then used as the blueprint to make specific proteins.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-custom-thumbnail="\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;" src="https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-topics-four-images-working-05-dna-rna-v2.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=9a559d78_32\%22" style="\&amp;quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;430555\&amp;quot;" width="\&amp;quot;600\&amp;quot;" alt="\&amp;quot;Vaccines" topics="" four="" images="" working="" 05="" dna="" rna="" v2\"="" sf-constrain-proportions="\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nucleic acid vaccine delivers a specific set of instructions to our cells, either as DNA or mRNA, for them to make the specific protein that we want our immune system to recognize and respond to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:initial;color:#313131;font-size:inherit;font-family:inherit;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt;The nucleic acid approach is a new way of developing vaccines. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, none had yet been through the full approvals process for use in humans, though some DNA vaccines, including for particular cancers, were undergoing human trials. Because of the pandemic, research in this area has progressed very fast and some mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 are getting emergency use authorization, which means they can now be given to people beyond using them only in clinical trials.&lt;/span&gt;\r\n &lt;span style="\&amp;quot;background-color:initial;color:#333333;font-size:inherit;font-family:inherit;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="\&amp;quot;button" button-blue-background\"="" style="\&amp;quot;text-align:center;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Read next 'Vaccines Explained' topic: &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/feature-stories/detail/access-and-allocation-how-will-there-be-fair-and-equitable-allocation-of-limited-supplies/%22"&gt;\"How &lt;strong&gt;does WHO ensure fair and equal access to vaccines?&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//the-race-for-a-covid-19-vaccine-explained</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//the-race-for-a-covid-19-vaccine-explained</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news-room/:category?/:language?</route_path><route_name>Newsroom</route_name></route></item><item><title>Access and allocation: how will there be fair and equitable allocation of limited supplies?</title><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p data-list="\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;" data-level="\&amp;quot;1\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution.

Work being carried out on potential COVID-19 vaccines follows the same processes as with other vaccines, but given the urgent need to\r\n        stop the pandemic, some of the steps are being carried out in parallel to accelerate the process. The COVAX Facility will accelerate this timeline by enabling early investments in the development of a variety of vaccine candidates; expanding manufacturing\r\n        capacity; and accelerating vaccine production ahead of the licencing process so that vaccines can be deployed without delay once they are proven to be safe and effective.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Core goals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO, as the COVAX lead for allocation, proposes that protecting individuals and health systems and minimizing the impact on economies should be the driving force behind the allocation of COVID-19 health products across different countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/initiatives/act-accelerator/%22"&gt;The ACT-Accelerator&lt;/a&gt; was set up to contain the COVID-19 pandemic faster and more efficiently\r\n        by ensuring that successful diagnostics, vaccines and treatments are shared equitably across all countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to achieving that goal is the design and implementation of a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/m/item/fair-allocation-mechanism-for-covid-19-vaccines-through-the-covax-facility/%22"&gt;Fair Allocation Framework.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equitable distribution is particularly important in the area of vaccines, which, if used correctly and equitably, could help to stop the acute phase of the pandemic and allow the rebuilding of our societies and economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/334299/WHO-2019-nCoV-SAGE_Framework-Allocation_and_prioritization-2020.1-eng.pdf?ua=1\%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Values Framework for the allocation and prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination&lt;/a&gt; offers high-level guidance globally on the values and ethical considerations regarding the allocation of COVID-19 vaccines between countries and offers guidance nationally on the prioritization of groups for vaccination within countries while\r\n        supply is limited.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prioritized groups&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While resources remain scarce, immunization programmes will have to prioritize certain groups over others before progressively expanding distribution to all population groups. When a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available, to reduce severe disease, deaths\r\n        and protect health systems, it’s important that priority &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccine-access-and-allocation/%22"&gt;groups&lt;/a&gt; receive the vaccine first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The definition of priority groups should be based on the most thorough analysis of evidence, including differences across diverse geographical and social settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These priority groups, at present, as determined by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frontline workers in health and social care settings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People over the age of 65&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People under the age of 65 who have underlying health conditions that put them at a higher risk of death&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase one&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries that are members of the COVAX Facility will have access to enough vaccines to immunize their population’s priority groups. In the first phase of allocation, doses will be made available to participating countries simultaneously until\r\n        they can cover approximately 20% of the population of every country. The first group prioritized would be frontline workers in health and social care settings in most countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-custom-thumbnail="\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;" src="https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-topics-five-images-01-v2.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=fc67b9e7_37\%22" style="\&amp;quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;" sf-constrain-proportions="\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;" width="\&amp;quot;600\&amp;quot;" alt="\&amp;quot;Vaccines" topics="" five="" images="" 01="" v2\"="" sf-size="\&amp;quot;773661\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By choosing to set an initial prioritization for health workers (in most countries this is 3% of less of the population), WHO wants to ensure that volumes meet the needs of well-resourced health systems while not penalizing countries with a lower\r\n        proportion of health and social care workers. Additional portions will follow gradually as more supply becomes available until 20% of the national population is covered in all participating countries. For 92 low and middle-income economies, reaching\r\n        20% is contingent upon raising funds for the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22http://www.gavi.org/gavi-covax-amc/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;COVAX AMC&lt;/a&gt;, the financing mechanism which will support their participation in the COVAX Facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once countries have been allocated enough doses for 20% of the population, additional doses will be made available depending on funding. In this second phase, the pace at which countries would receive additional doses of vaccine would be determined\r\n        by an assessment of their risk at any given time, if there remains substantial supply limitations. Consideration will be based on an evaluation of threat (the potential impact of COVID-19 on a country, assessed using epidemiological data) and\r\n        vulnerability (the vulnerability of a country, based on health systems and population factors).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-custom-thumbnail="\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;" src="https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-topics-five-images-02-v2.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=69a2bee9_34\%22" style="\&amp;quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;" sf-constrain-proportions="\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;" width="\&amp;quot;600\&amp;quot;" alt="\&amp;quot;Vaccines" topics="" five="" images="" 02="" v2\"="" sf-size="\&amp;quot;1129486\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using these criteria, the analysis will identify countries with the highest risk, which will receive vaccines at a faster pace than those considered at lower risk. Special consideration will be given to countries that may suddenly face major outbreaks\r\n        or national disasters throughout the allocation process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humanitarian buffer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the vaccine allocations in phases one and two, some doses of vaccine are proposed to be reserved as part of a “humanitarian buffer”. A small buffer of up to 5% of the total number of available doses will be set aside as\r\n        a backstop mechanism to serve as a provider of last resort for if/when national, government-led processes fail to reach certain populations.&amp;nbsp; For example populations living outside government-controlled areas and those who work within these\r\n        settings could be served through the Humanitarian buffer if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments and states are encouraged to include all high-risk individuals and populations, according to the WHO SAGE recommendations, independent of their residency and legal status, including internally displaced populations, refugees, migrants\r\n        and detainees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-custom-thumbnail="\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;" src="https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-topics-five-images-03.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=820ba71_34\%22" style="\&amp;quot;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;" sf-constrain-proportions="\&amp;quot;true\&amp;quot;" width="\&amp;quot;600\&amp;quot;" alt="\&amp;quot;Vaccines" topics="" five="" images="" 03\"="" sf-size="\&amp;quot;1156696\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparent allocation and use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO Secretariat recognizes the right of each country to decide how the vaccine will be used within their territory, but it encourages countries to consider the  &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Prioritization-2023.1/%22"&gt;recommendations regarding target groups&lt;/a&gt; issued by WHO’s SAGE committee, and to be transparent about their decision-making\r\n        processes and ultimate use of the vaccine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) is the principal advisory group to WHO for vaccines and immunization.

Some vaccines don’t have preservatives because they are stored in one-dose vials and are discarded\r\n        after the single dose is administered. The most commonly used preservative is 2-phenoxyethanol. It has been used for many years in a number of vaccines, is used in a range of baby care products and is safe for use in vaccines, as it has little\r\n        toxicity in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stabilizers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;Stabilizers prevent chemical reactions from occurring within the vaccine and keep the vaccine components from sticking to the vaccine vial.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;Stabilizers can be sugars (lactose, sucrose), amino acids (glycine), gelatin, and proteins (recombinant human albumin, derived from yeast).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/health-topics/vaccines-ingredients.jpg?sfvrsn=1a2337ab_36&amp;amp;Status=Master\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;Vaccine" ingredients:="" antigen,="" adjuvant,="" preservatives,="" stabilizers,="" surfactants,="" residuals,="" diluent.\"="" sf-size="\&amp;quot;755676\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surfactants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;Surfactants keep all the ingredients in the vaccine blended together.

Substances will vary depending on the manufacturing process used and may include egg\r\n            proteins, yeast or antibiotics. Residual traces of these substances which may be present in a vaccine are in such small quantities that they need to be measured as parts per million or parts per billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diluent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;A diluent is a liquid used to dilute a vaccine to the correct concentration immediately prior to use.

An adjuvant improves the immune response to the vaccine, sometimes by keeping the vaccine at the injection site for a little longer or by stimulating local immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;The adjuvant may be a tiny amount of aluminium salts (like aluminium phosphate, aluminium hydroxide or potassium aluminium sulphate). Aluminium has been shown not to cause any long-term health problems, and humans ingest aluminium regularly through\r\n            eating and drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How are vaccines developed?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;Most vaccines have been in use for decades, with millions of people receiving them safely every year. As with all medicines, every vaccine must go through extensive and rigorous testing to ensure it is safe before it can be introduced in a country’s\r\n            vaccine programme.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;Each vaccine under development must first undergo screenings and evaluations to determine which antigen should be used to invoke an immune response. This preclinical phase is done without testing on humans. An experimental vaccine is first tested\r\n            in animals to evaluate its safety and potential to prevent disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;If the vaccine triggers an immune response, it is then tested in human clinical trials in three phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;The vaccine is given to a small number of volunteers to assess its safety, confirm it generates an immune response, and determine the right dosage.&amp;nbsp;Generally in this phase vaccines are tested in young, healthy adult volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;The vaccine is then given to several hundred volunteers to further assess its safety and ability to generate an immune response. Participants in this phase have the same characteristics (such as age, sex) as the people for whom the vaccine is\r\n            intended. There are usually multiple trials in this phase to evaluate various age groups and different formulations of the vaccine. A group that did not get the vaccine is usually included in phase as a comparator group to determine whether\r\n            the changes in the vaccinated group are attributed to the vaccine, or have happened by chance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;The vaccine is next given to thousands of volunteers – and compared to a similar group of people who didn’t get the vaccine, but received a comparator product – to determine if the vaccine is effective against the disease it\r\n            is designed to protect against and to study its safety in a much larger group of people. Most of the time phase three trials are conducted across multiple countries and multiple sites within a country to assure the findings of the vaccine\r\n            performance apply to many different populations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;During phase two and phase three trials, the volunteers and the scientists conducting the study are shielded from knowing which volunteers had received the vaccine being tested or the comparator product. This is called “blinding” and\r\n            is necessary to assure that neither the volunteers nor the scientists are influenced in their assessment of safety or effectiveness by knowing who got which product. After the trial is over and all the results are finalized, the volunteers\r\n            and the trial scientists are informed who received the vaccine and who received the comparator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;img 29="" src="https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/topic-two-ciinical-trials-static-29-oct.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=3d4663df_42\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;Topic" two="" ciinical="" trials_static="" oct\"="" sf-size="\&amp;quot;866247\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;When the results of all these clinical trials are available, a series of steps is required, including reviews of efficacy and safety for regulatory and public health policy approvals. Officials in each country closely review the study data and decide\r\n        whether to authorize the vaccine for use. A vaccine must be proven to be safe and effective across a broad population before it will be approved and introduced into a national immunization programme. The bar for vaccine safety and efficacy is\r\n        extremely high, recognizing that vaccines are given to people who are otherwise healthy and specifically free from the illness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;Further monitoring takes place in an ongoing way after the vaccine is introduced. There are systems to monitor the safety and effectiveness of all vaccines. This enables scientists to keep track of vaccine impact and safety even as they are used in\r\n        a large number of people, over a long time frame.&amp;nbsp; These data are used to adjust the policies for vaccine use to optimize their impact, and they also allow the vaccine to be safely tracked throughout its use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once a vaccine is in use, it must be continuously monitored to make sure it continues to be safe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="\&amp;quot;button" button-blue-background\"="" style="\&amp;quot;text-align:center;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/manufacturing-safety-and-quality-control/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" data-sf-marked="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Read the next 'Vaccines explained' topic: \"Manufacturing, safety and quality control of vaccines\" &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//how-are-vaccines-developed</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//how-are-vaccines-developed</guid><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news-room/:category?/:language?</route_path><route_name>Newsroom</route_name></route></item><item><title>How do vaccines work?</title><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution.

When a person is susceptible and they encounter a harmful organism, it can lead to disease and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;The body has many ways of defending itself against&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;pathogens&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(disease-causing organisms). Skin, mucus, and cilia (microscopic hairs that move debris away from the lungs) all work as physical barriers to prevent pathogens\r\n        from entering the body in the first place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;When a pathogen does infect the body, our body’s defences, called the immune system, are triggered and the pathogen is attacked and destroyed or overcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2 dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;The body's natural response&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;A pathogen is a bacterium, virus, parasite or fungus that can cause disease within the body. Each pathogen is made up of several subparts, usually unique to that specific pathogen and the disease it causes. The subpart of a pathogen that causes the\r\n        formation of antibodies is called an antigen. The antibodies produced in response to the pathogen’s antigen are an important part of the immune system. You can consider antibodies as the soldiers in your body’s defense system. Each\r\n        antibody, or soldier, in our system is trained to recognize one specific antigen. We have thousands of different antibodies in our bodies. When the human body is exposed to an antigen for the first time, it takes time for the immune system to\r\n        respond and produce antibodies specific to that antigen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;In the meantime, the person is susceptible to becoming ill.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;Once the antigen-specific antibodies are produced, they work with the rest of the immune system to destroy the pathogen and stop the disease. Antibodies to one pathogen generally don’t protect against another pathogen except when two pathogens\r\n        are very similar to each other, like cousins. Once the body produces antibodies in its primary response to an antigen, it also creates antibody-producing memory cells, which remain alive even after the pathogen is defeated by the antibodies. If\r\n        the body is exposed to the same pathogen more than once, the antibody response is much faster and more effective than the first time around because the memory cells are at the ready to pump out antibodies against that antigen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;This means that if the person is exposed to the dangerous pathogen in the future, their immune system will be able to respond immediately, protecting against disease.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-antibody-illustration-01-29-oct7f4a97bd839b4b6996c82c1832a52682.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=d0d1dc56_9\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;Vaccines" antibody="" illustration="" 01_29="" oct\"="" sf-size="\&amp;quot;458430\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How vaccines help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines contain weakened or inactive parts of a particular organism (antigen) that triggers an immune response within the body. Newer vaccines contain the blueprint for producing antigens rather than the antigen itself. Regardless of whether the vaccine\r\n    is made up of the antigen itself or the blueprint so that the body will produce the antigen, this weakened version will not cause the disease in the person receiving the vaccine, but it will prompt their immune system to respond much as it would have\r\n    on its first reaction to the actual pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-antibody-illustration-02-29-oct.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=a79ee886_36\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;Vaccines" antibody="" illustration="" 02_29="" oct\"="" sf-size="\&amp;quot;554468\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some vaccines require multiple doses, given weeks or months apart. This is sometimes needed to allow for the production of long-lived antibodies and development of memory cells. In this way, the body is trained to fight the specific disease-causing organism,\r\n    building up memory of the pathogen so as to rapidly fight it if and when exposed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Herd immunity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;When someone is vaccinated, they are very likely to be protected against the targeted disease. But not everyone can be vaccinated. People with underlying health conditions that weaken their immune systems (such as cancer or HIV) or who have severe allergies\r\n    to some vaccine components may not be able to get vaccinated with certain vaccines. These people can still be protected if they live in and amongst others who are vaccinated. When a lot of people in a community are vaccinated the pathogen has a hard\r\n    time circulating because most of the people it encounters are immune. So the more that others are vaccinated, the less likely people who are unable to be protected by vaccines are at risk of even being exposed to the harmful pathogens. This is called\r\n    herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;This is especially important for those people who not only can’t be vaccinated but may be more susceptible to the diseases we vaccinate against. No single vaccine provides 100% protection, and herd immunity does not provide full protection to those\r\n    who cannot safely be vaccinated. But with herd immunity, these people will have substantial protection, thanks to those around them being vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;Vaccinating not only protects yourself, but also protects those in the community who are unable to be vaccinated. If you are able to, get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/herd1.png?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=62c2f66a_53\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;Herd1\&amp;quot;" sf-size="\&amp;quot;178213\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;img 1="" src="https://www.who.int/%22/images/default-source/vaccines-explained/vaccines-topic-1-illustrations-04.jpg?Status=Master&amp;amp;sfvrsn=72e55c08_11\%22" alt="\&amp;quot;Vaccines" topic="" illustrations="" 04\"="" sf-size="\&amp;quot;723494\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;Throughout history, humans have successfully developed vaccines for a number of life-threatening diseases, including meningitis, tetanus, measles and&amp;nbsp;wild poliovirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" style="\&amp;quot;width:571px;height:315px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;" contenteditable="\&amp;quot;false\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;div data-sf-disable-link-event="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/embed/SkSdFnzjNPs/%22" allowfullscreen="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" width="\&amp;quot;571\&amp;quot;" height="\&amp;quot;315\&amp;quot;" frameborder="\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p dir="\&amp;quot;ltr\&amp;quot;"&gt;In the early 1900s, polio was a worldwide disease, paralysing hundreds of thousands of people every year. By 1950, two effective vaccines against the disease had been developed. But vaccination in some parts of the world was still not common enough to\r\n    stop the spread of polio, particularly in Africa. In the 1980s, a united worldwide effort to eradicate polio from the planet began. Over many years and several decades, polio vaccination, using routine immunization visits and mass vaccination campaigns,\r\n    has taken place in all continents. Millions of people, mostly children, have been vaccinated and in August 2020, the African continent was certified&amp;nbsp;wild poliovirus free, joining all other parts of the world except Pakistan and Afghanistan, where\r\n    polio has not yet been eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="\&amp;quot;button" button-blue-background\"="" style="\&amp;quot;text-align:center;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/how-are-vaccines-developed/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" data-sf-marked="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Read next 'Vaccines Explained' topic: \"How are vaccines developed?”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//how-do-vaccines-work</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//how-do-vaccines-work</guid><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news-room/:category?/:language?</route_path><route_name>Newsroom</route_name></route></item><item><title>Manufacturing, safety and quality control of vaccines</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt;This article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution.

The EUL exists because, in a pandemic situation, products that could benefit the lives of people all over the world may be prevented from coming to market with sufficient speed. The EUL is a\r\n    fast-tracked but rigorous process, designed to bring impactful products to all those in need, as quickly as possible, on a time-limited basis and based on a risk-versus-benefit evaluation. The WHO PQ/EUL recommendation may be used by UN agencies such\r\n    as UNICEF and the Pan American Health Organization Revolving Fund for procurement decisions in low- and middle-income countries.&amp;nbsp;Gavi also relies on WHO EUL/PQ to specify which vaccines its funds may be used to purchase. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it’s made&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically,&amp;nbsp;companies will work independently to complete clinical development plans for a vaccine. Once a vaccine is authorized, manufacturing begins to scale up.

In the search for a COVID-19 vaccine, researchers and developers are working on several different phases in parallel, to speed up results. It is the\r\n    scale of the financial and political commitments to the development of a vaccine that has allowed this accelerated development to take place. Also, nations and international health organizations are working together through &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22https://who.int/initiatives/act-accelerator/covax/%22" data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;COVAX&lt;/a&gt; to invest in development capacity upfront to streamline the process, as well as to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it’s packaged&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the vaccine has been made in bulk quantities’, it is bottled in glass vials and then carefully packaged for safe cold storage and transport.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine packaging must be able to withstand extreme temperatures, as well as the risks involved in being transported globally. Therefore, vaccine vials are most commonly made from glass, as it is durable and able to maintain its integrity in extreme temperatures.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it’s stored&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a vaccine is too hot or too cold, it becomes less effective or even inactive. If stored at the incorrect temperature, vaccines can be ruined or unsafe for use. Most vaccines require refrigerated storage at between 2 and 8 °C.&amp;nbsp;Some vaccines\r\n    require temperatures as cold as -20°C. Some of the newer vaccines need to be kept ultra cold at &amp;nbsp;-70°C.&amp;nbsp; For frozen vaccines some of them can be safely stored for a limited time between 2 and 8°C.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular refrigerators cannot maintain an even temperature consistently, so specialized medical refrigerators are required for these precious products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it’s shipped&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To maintain this cold chain, vaccines are shipped using specialized equipment that does not compromise the integrity of the product. Once shipments land in the destination country, refrigerated lorries transport the vaccines from the airport to the warehouse\r\n    cold room. From there, portable iceboxes are used to transport vaccines from the cold room to regional centres where they’re stored in refrigerators. If vaccination takes place outside of the regional facility, the final step often requires\r\n    portable iceboxes to transport the goods to local areas for vaccination campaigns.&amp;nbsp; New technologies have invented some portable devices that can keep vaccines at their cold temperature for several days without needing electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-sf-ec-immutable="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" contenteditable="\&amp;quot;false\&amp;quot;" style="\&amp;quot;width:560px;height:315px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;div data-sf-disable-link-event="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;iframe width="\&amp;quot;560\&amp;quot;" height="\&amp;quot;315\&amp;quot;" src="https://www.who.int/%22https://www.youtube.com/embed/4SaDefN5L4k/%22" frameborder="\&amp;quot;0\&amp;quot;" allowfullscreen="\&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style="\&amp;quot;background-color:transparent;font-size:25px;text-align:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;\&amp;quot;"&gt;Quality control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once vaccines start being administered, national authorities and WHO constantly monitor for – and establish the severity of – any possible adverse side effects and responses from people who have received the vaccine. The safety of the vaccine\r\n    is paramount, with regular assessments and post-approval clinical studies to report on its safety and effectiveness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies are often conducted to determine how long a given vaccine remains protective.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="\&amp;quot;button" button-blue-background\"=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/%22/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-race-for-a-covid-19-vaccine-explained/%22"&gt;Read the next 'Vaccines Explained' topic: \"The different types of COVID-19 vaccines\"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//manufacturing-safety-and-quality-control</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail//manufacturing-safety-and-quality-control</guid><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><route><provider_id>who</provider_id><provider_name>World Health Organization | WHO</provider_name><route_path>/news-room/:category?/:language?</route_path><route_name>Newsroom</route_name></route></item></channel></rss>
